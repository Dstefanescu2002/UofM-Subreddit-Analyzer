t3_hbi5nc,2020-06-18 16:39:40,My Concerns on UofM Reopening,"To start, I feel like I should say I'm not sure if this is a rant or if I am trying to convince people of something or what.. . EDIT: This post is long and a commentor suggested it would be better to put the TLDR at the start rather than the end:. . TLDR: I personally believe that it is not safe nor is it worth it for the school to reopen at all in the Fall and that everyone would be better served if UofM stayed online. I highly recommend you read the full post but I included this for those who may skip this post entirely otherwise.. . Recently on this subreddit I saw a poll about how concerned people were about going back and I saw about 71% of the vote (521/729 when I saw) were either ""Cautiously Optimistic"" or ""Excited!"". While I understand people's enthusiasm and I share the desire to go back, I feel like the University is not ready for an in-person semester -- even a limited ""public health conscious"" semester. Many public health experts have criticized states for reopening too quickly and right now it looks like numbers are flattening out, however I believe that very soon -- because of the early reopening -- numbers will start spiking again and that could create problems.. . Some may just see this as fearmongering, and I don't think we should be afraid of the virus but there is going to be a second spike or ""second wave"" the rush to reopen just expedited that process -- even though the State of Michigan may have been slow to reopen other states were not and many students at UofM are not from Michigan and therefore they could bring germs back.. . Some may use the argument that the majority of students are not in the high-risk group. However, just because we are in our twenties and we are in the low risk demographic doesn't mean young healthy 20, 30 etc. year olds haven't died. More than that, I don't think ""not dying"" should be our standard, being intubated or moved to the ICU can be a physically taxing and mentally traumatizing experience and COVID-19 can absolutely destroy a person's lungs/organs even if it spares them.. . Furthermore, Schlissel laid out that anyone who gets sick will be quarantined, however that misses the point that at this moment we do not know exactly to what extent asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission play a part in the spread of COVID-19.. . Think of how many students live in the dorms, the school is not about to give every single on campus student their own single room this semester. Dorms by their very nature are incubators of disease, if you're in a triple and you get sick you could spread that to the other two people in your room and they could spread it to anyone they meet before anyone shows symptoms and that is how an outbreak could start. I have heard of some schools addressing this problem by getting hotel rooms for their students; however, assuming UofM even has the capability to do that students who live ""on campus"" would still need to go to dining halls in long lines (even last year when take out service started the lines were still long) to get their food which again is dangerous and could spread disease.. . I am aware that a hybrid semester would mean limited in person instruction and that since in-person classes will be limited there should be less interaction so this situation should be less likely, however I would wager that most people are still going to meet up with friends and even if everyone avoids meeting friends or going out to eat etc. some interaction will definitely happen assuming lab classes and discussions are in person as well.. . So far there's no data to show how often asymptomatic patients spread the disease so even if we have smaller in person labs, or smaller in person lectures it's still dangerous considering how people move and spend their time on campus.. . I saw in a recent subreddit post that Schlissel said UofM will implement contact tracing and test every single student when they return to campus. 1) Nowhere in the United States has managed to implement contact tracing so how exactly will UofM do that before we return -- especially if they are looking to lose 400 million to 1 billion dollars 2) Even without a testing kit shortage where is UofM going to acquire about 46,000 tests (if not more accounting for spares) before we get back and 3) how exactly would 46,000 students get tested in a way that isn't either a logistical or public health nightmare? Furthermore, UHS would be the main place people go to get treatment and they tend to already be packed during a normal semester let alone a pandemic semester.. . And winter only makes all these problems worse, people not going outdoors means more people in enclosed spaces where droplets can spread between people easily. Assuming COVID is seasonal (which technically is irrelevant because seasonality does not affect pandemic viruses in the first year due to the lack of an immune population), the virus would also be able to stick around in the air longer making chances for infection even more likely.. . All of this fails to mention that Winter is also Flu season, which by itself without any other major disease outbreaks, usually causes hospitals to exceed their capacity. Could you imagine the nightmare if UofM hospital had to deal with Flu and COVID Cases occurring both among students and people that are normally serviced by UofM? Some have argued that winter would be better because people would not want to go outside anymore, however this would make everything much worse not better.. . This would mean either UofM would endanger all of our lives and our health by keeping us around past the start of flu season or we would be sent home after a partial in-person semester and I question how that would be worth it because that would put everyone in the exact same situation we were in back in Winter 2020. Everyone moving in during fall and then moving out either at the end of fall semester or earlier during Thanksgiving is wildly more dangerous than nobody moving in or out at all -- just spare a thought for how many people you interact with during move-in/move out. And if you're planning to go through airports that would mean going through congested security lines only to then board a metal tube where you will be sitting in close proximity to at least 100 other people for hours.. . Some might read this and say ""well if you have an issue you can stay home"" and that's fair. If I decide I don't want to come back I won't -- but I'm not writing this post about me I'm thinking about the people who feel like they don't have a choice and come back, student athletes told to come back because UofM wants to make some money to recoup their losses from the pandemic, or the people that come back simply under the assumption everything is safe and they will be fine.. . I feel like we have to just accept the facts instead of trying to force an in-person fall semester because it's dangerous. I am aware other schools are doing in person semesters as well, notably MSU, but UofM doesn't have to follow the trends.. . Yes, fully online is the harder way out, both for UofM financially and for the students. If they went fully online, some people would not come back and some people who wouldn't be able to afford a gap year will be forced to have a worse education -- which is not nothing -- but such is the time we live in.. . I agree being home is boring as shit, some people have tough and abusive home situations, and almost everyone wants to be back at Michigan rather than stuck at home for any more time. However, we are at war right now and we all need to play our part -- the thing about wars is that everyone needs to make sacrifices and our sacrifice is going to be our comfort and the quality of our education and while it sucks I think it's something we have to do for the greater good.. . Not to mention, part of Schlissel's assumptions for the ""public health informed semester"" is that people will follow a ""social compact"". In my opinion, that assumption is too optimistic and to some extent it is naive unless he has some way of enforcing it -- which even then that's a stretch because how exactly will UofM follow around 46,000 students to make sure nobody breaks the compact.. . I would remind others who were on campus during the start of the shutdown this past Winter 2020 semester that Rick's and other bars were filled and many students continued to go to parties even as we were being told to shut down and quarantine.. . Some might argue, that UofM wants us to come back because they are concerned about our education. I would contend that the UofM Administration (not the professors mind you, the executives that make up the upper levels of administration) does not care if our education is good or bad as long as they are able to recoup part of their expected 400 million to 1 billion-dollar losses which is why they want us back so badly.. . Although preferably they wouldn't have us on campus at all, part of fall might be fine. But having any number of students back on campus is an inherent risk than not having them at all. If the school reopens in any regard for normal students that means they will definitely bring back student athletes even if most normal students have their classes online.. . Bringing back student athletes is already in motion, with UofM announcing a process for them to come back. Student athletes are not even paid by the school yet now will be asked to put their lives on the line just because UofM wants to make a dollar? It is shameful and disgusting for them to tout how much they care about their athletes and how much they want a safe process yet still are trying to participate in the NCAA this year.. . Yes, I know they are again in the low risk group especially since they are at peak physical health. However, I would reiterate that being low risk does not mean these athletes can't get sick with COVID-19 and are immune to severe cases and COVID-19 does not have an agreed upon treatment and is not as well understood as a disease like the Flu.. . Furthermore, even if UofM does a television only season for sports like (for example) football those athletes will still have to interact with a very large group of people in close proximity: Teammates, coaches, coordinators, TV production crew, refs, the other team who may have traveled from another state and could have brought the virus with them. Even that fails to bring up the fact that football is a contact sport.. . Recently Beijing shut down their sports stadiums despite being one of the first places to recover from the first wave of the virus. Another recent story was the UFC having 3 positive cases after attempting to continue fights back in May.. . Some might say, ""well if the NCAA reopens, we have to participate"" and I just don't feel like that's true. Yes, it would create issues, but if UofM cares as much as they claim about their students and by extension the student athletes then they would temporarily withdraw from the NCAA or at the very least not participate in some of the major sports like football even if they'd lose money - because that's what putting students first looks like.. . We cannot allow the University to put our lives second in the name of saving money first. Some might bring up that UofM needs the money otherwise it could damage our education in the future if not put UofM in financial peril. While I am aware currently colleges are fighting for their very existence because of the financial pains brought on by COVID-19, I believe UofM will be fine whether or not we come back. The endowment fund for UofM is 12 billion dollars and 22% of that is just return on investments made. Our endowment fund ranks in the top ten out of all colleges across the United States. I am aware the endowment fund is not a bank account and you can't just take money out of it on a whim, but this is still is evidence of the financial solvency of UofM.. . On top of that, while Schlissel and other executives have taken pay cuts, one person they have not mentioned is Erik Lundberg who is the manager for the endowment. His salary in 2018 was 720,000 plus 150% of base pay. In 2016 Mr. Lundberg made more than 2 million dollars.. . Others will argue that the reason for us coming back is to save the jobs of those lowest in the pecking order. However, I would argue that by coming back while we would save their jobs, we would be putting their lives at risk by having them working in an environment that by all accounts is more dangerous than if the school was not open. Furthermore, it is the University's (and honestly if we are being real it's really the federal government's responsibility) responsibility to provide for these workers.. . I don't expect UofM to keep every single worker on their payroll because while that would be great it is not realistic; however, I do believe that the executives should take a bigger pay cut. Recently Schlissel and the Chancellors of Flint and Dearborn took a 10% pay cut despite the fact their salary is around 900,000, 400,000 and 437,000 dollars respectively meaning they only took cuts of 90,000, 40,000 and 43,700 each even though their UofM salary does not include other forms of income like stocks, assets, book deals, money for speaking etc., and use that extra funding in order to provide payment to low income UofM workers who may be out of work due to the pandemic.. . I personally have considered starting a petition, writing letters, etc. to the school to tell them to stay shut down and to focus their resources on creating a better online experience since the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be completed by sometime next year. If not that extreme, at least a petition or letters or something telling the school to cancel big fall sports like football. However, I have held off on that because it seems as though public support seems to be for reopening and it feels pointless to even try. I guess this is both a rant and perhaps an exercise to see if there were others who felt the same as I do.. . EDIT 2: I talked about student athletes and asymptomatic transmission. 2 student athletes have tested positive for COVID-19 both were asymptomatic: [https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/2020/06/two-university-of-michigan-athletes-test-positive-for-coronavirus.html](https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/2020/06/two-university-of-michigan-athletes-test-positive-for-coronavirus.html)",102,"My Concerns on UofM Reopening.

t3_he0mck,2020-06-22 20:54:51,Update on LSA Class Size and Fall Information,"""Dear LSA Students,. . I am writing to follow up on the news from President Schlissel that the University of Michigan will have an in-person, public-health informed fall semester. As the dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and as a faculty member co-teaching an undergraduate course called ""Epic Grammar Fails"" this fall, I am really looking forward to having the opportunity to engage with you in person and online. There is an irrepressible and irreplaceable energy that you as students bring to campus, and it inspires me every year.. . And while there is uncertainty ahead, I want to start with a pledge and a certainty. The pledge is to make your health and safety our first priority, always. The certainty is in the power and lasting relevance of LSA's liberal arts and sciences education. I truly believe that a liberal arts education has never been more important, or more valuable, than it is now. We reimagine the world here in LSA, and we can do that better because you are here in our community, with all the diverse perspectives you bring. We push the boundaries of what's understood about human experience and the natural world, taking up the existential challenges of climate change, systemic racism, the biology of viruses, and more. We pursue these questions with rigor and empathy, knowing that no one person or field of study has all the solutions. And through research and learning, we cultivate skills and mindsets that are fundamental to making purposeful, positive change in the world.. . As the president mentioned, the university is a big place, and many practices need to be determined by individual schools and colleges like LSA. I want to share some initial information about particular steps LSA will be taking, with more details to follow in the weeks ahead.. . First, I want to acknowledge that, while we know a good deal about what the fall will look like, there is much we don't yet know. The university is still determining, for example, how regular virus screening will work, how we will manage transitions between classes, and in-classroom protocols to ensure safe distancing. We are working hard on these and other questions, and I ask for your patience as we do so. This is new territory for all of us.. . Second, I am turning to you today to say that this will take all of us working together, and to invite your partnership. Along with the LSA faculty, staff, and my leadership team, I have the greatest respect for your talents, insights, and commitment to your education. This past March, when we had to pivot quickly to remote teaching and learning, we saw how much we can accomplish when we're all working together, rowing in the same direction. I believe we can and must maintain that collaborative spirit because, for this year to work well, it will take all of us being rigorous about health and safety, purposeful in pursuing our educational mission, and generous with each other as we innovate and learn along the way.. . Looking ahead to classes. . As the president said in his message, you will get to choose whether to participate in a hybrid learning experience (a mixture of in-person and online classes) or whether to participate fully online.. . Below is some additional information about classes; we'll share more over the weeks ahead:. . All large LSA classes (with enrollments over 45) will be fully available online. . Smaller classes and discussion sections may gather in person while maintaining social distance--but may also be partly or entirely online. . Whether courses meet in person or online, all of them will offer ways that students can connect with the material virtually and asynchronously, in case they become sick or need to self-isolate. . We are also working to identify which classes will be online, in person, or a hybrid; we will share those details as soon as we have them so that you can confirm or adjust your class schedules.. And just a reminder that the academic calendar will look different this year, with a start date on August 31, no fall break, and online coursework only after Thanksgiving break through exams and the end of the semester. Winter semester will start on January 19, later than usual, and there will be no spring break in 2021.. As always, we are also committed to providing you with tools and resources to enrich your classroom education, to support your discovery of extracurricular experiences, to help you prepare for life after graduation, and to answer your questions. The Newnan Advising Center, LSA Opportunity Hub, optiMize, Sweetland Center for Writing, Science Learning Center, the Math Lab, and the Transfer Student Center are all ready to support your exploration and well-being.. . If you haven't had a chance yet, I hope you'll take the time to visit the university's Maize and Blueprint guide for living and learning together on campus, particularly the section for students and families. The site has important information about safety, housing, the academic calendar, and resources you can rely on this summer and throughout the academic year.. . Finally, remember that any time you have questions and don't know where to turn, you can reach out to lsa-covid-help@umich.edu, where an LSA staff member can connect you with people and resources who can help you.. . I speak for my colleagues all across LSA when I say that we are very excited to see you at the end of August, both on campus and online. You are the heartbeat of the college, and you inspire us every day with your insights, infectious curiosity, and drive to make the world a better place. Take good care of yourselves, and please be in touch with us anytime.. . Best wishes,. Anne Curzan""",34,"Update on LSA Class Size and Fall Information. ""Dear LSA Students,. .

t3_hejb8g,2020-06-23 17:49:43,Help an incoming freshman decide whether to go on-campus or remote...,"So, I'm trying to figure out whether I should go in-person or not. All of my classes are huge (EECS 280, EECS 203, ECON 101, etc.) and I've checked enrollment for all of them and they all have > 45 students enrolled. . . As of now, all of my discussion sections are on Friday, so even if I'm on campus I'd theoretically only be leaving my residence hall for one day every week outside of meals. The rest of the time I'd be holed up in my dorm watching lectures anyways.. . I'm also from California, so by staying at home I save travel costs, on-campus dorm costs, and meal plan costs which probably amounts to at least 10k per semester. I also already have an LSA scholarship of 10k per semester, so by staying at home I'm effectively doubling my scholarship amount.. . My main concern is that I won't make friends or be able to participate in on-campus only extracurricular activities. Fortunately, before my senior year of high school I did research with a professor at U of M and got to stay on campus for the summer, so I'm already plugged into an extracurricular activity with a mentor I'm familiar with and enjoy working with and know the campus pretty well. (This research can easily be done in a virtual format, and I'm getting paid to do it virtually this summer as an RA.). . It seems like a pretty clear decision for me to stay home because of cost savings, but there's this sense of FOMO since it looks like at least 80% of freshmen will be going on campus. Also, even if I pay for housing and end up going, I'm worried that the semester will become remote for everyone a month and a half in. . . Any thoughts or aspects I may not be considering that I should take a look at? Thanks for any inputs!. . Update: Wow, I didn't expect this many responses! It seems like most people are suggesting I stay at home. As of now, I am going to kick the can down the road on this decision as there is still more information to be revealed on how all of this will be managed by the university and more specifically by LSA. Still, at the current moment, saving that 10k for the first semester or just playing it by ear seem like the best options. Regardless of what I choose in the end, I really appreciate everyone's responses. . . In all of this, however, I realized that since I have family friends nearby A2 that wouldn't mind hosting me for a couple nights here and there, I could also travel to campus, say, two or three times in the semester. Round trip travel would cost me $500 per trip, so even traveling 4x in the semester would only be $2k compared to the $10k I'd end up saving. I could attend some discussion sections, meet peers and professors, etc. My only issue with this option is that it may not work out at all if someone is checking that I'm quarantining every time I visit or if I never even receive an M-Card to enter buildings, etc. If someone could shed some light on if this would be possible, that'd be great.",46,"Help an incoming freshman decide whether to go on-campus or remote....

I would also love to hear about research opportunities in neuro and how easy it is to get involved and make connections with professors as a transfer student. Any information helps!

I'm an incoming freshman to u of m and I plan on doing a math or CS major or some combination of the two. In addition, I'm very interested in sustainability and climate issues but I don't want to go into any careers in that field. Ideally, I will have a career that connects an interest to climate issues to a primarily mathematics/computer science field.. . My question is: Is there any point to taking sustainability courses/seminars through the university when they don't have anything to do with my major? . . The logic I have right now is that whatever is taught in the sustainability course/seminar can easily be found online, through books, or extracurricular initiatives. Since the course has nothing to do with fulfilling pre-reqs for my major, there is no need to take it. I can always research and get involved with the issues in my own time.. . Furthermore, without the sustainability course I have open time in my schedule to fulfill LSA distribution reqs. With more time to fulfill these reqs it will be much less stressful for me down the road to get a CS Math double major or a Math major CS minor. On top of that, if I decide to just get one major and nothing else, the option to graduate early will be more accessible.. . Should I focus my entire schedule towards fulfilling degree requirements and just leave the social justice interests for free time? Is there any real benefit to learning these things in a formal setting when I don't plan to make a full-blown career out of it?. .

Public Policy dean Michael Barr hinted at the move in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/michael_s_barr/status/1281077700329906179?s=21) supporting international students early Thursday morning.. . ""We're going to join other Universities in suing to block this arbitrary ICE guidance, which serves no legitimate governmental purpose and penalizes our international students, who so enrich our educational community,"" Barr wrote. . . The lawsuit, filed against the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Wednesday in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, alleges the new guidance is ""arbitrary and capricious"" in its removal of emergency COVID-19 exceptions for F-1 students taking online classes. . . The lawsuit argues the guidance fails to consider the effects on universities that have been planning for months for the 2020-2021 year, as well as the ""devastating effects"" on international students caught in limbo. It also states that the guidance's ""lack of any real justification"" means it could have been implemented to compel universities to change their fall plans. The guidance from DHS was announced hours after Harvard University released its plan for an all-online semester. . . The lawsuit says the July 6 guidance threatens to force many international students to withdraw from Harvard and MIT, forcing both schools to make an ""impossible choice."" . . ""Lose numerous students who bring immense benefits to the school or take steps to retain those students through in-person classes, even when those steps contradict each school's judgment about how best to protect the health of the students, faculty, staff, and the entire university community,"" the lawsuit reads. . . On March 13, ICE [announced](https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2020/Coronavirus%20Guidance_3.13.20.pdf) international students attending a school that temporarily switches to remote instruction due to the pandemic will retain their visa status. The March 13 guidance indicated the provision would remain ""in effect for the duration of the emergency."" The lawsuit points out that President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration has not been rescinded and COVID-19 cases have reached [record highs](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) in recent weeks. . . University President Mark Schlissel [wrote](https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/statements/statement-on-homeland-security-policy-affecting-international-students/) Tuesday the guidance does not interfere with the University's plans for a hybrid fall semester. However, he wrote the University opposes ""arbitrary restrictions"" on international students. . . ""Even with this initial review that shows a less direct impact on our students, we agree with the statement from the Association of American Universities - of which U-M is a member - that calls this policy 'immensely misguided and deeply cruel to the tens of thousands of international students who come to the United States every year,'"" Schlissel wrote.. . According to the University's International Center [website](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/planning-fall-term-2020-new-dhs-procedures-and-u-m-updates), international students must take at least one in-person class under the new guidance. The Registrar's office and schools and colleges are working to finalize course instruction modes by Aug. 7, after which students will be allowed to adjust their schedules to fulfill their immigration requirements. . . The International Center website said the new guidance would only force international students out of the United States if the University transitioned to online only instruction before Nov. 30. . . ""The only scenario in which we make such a switch is if we have severe COVID occurrence in our community and it is deemed absolutely necessary to go online only,"" the website reads.. . The University is also working on reissuing I-20 documents to international students with a statement confirming it is not online-only for the fall.. .

""Lose numerous students who bring immense benefits to the school or take steps to retain those students through in-person classes, even when those steps contradict each school's judgment about how best to protect the health of the students, faculty, staff, and the entire university community,"" the lawsuit reads. . . On March 13, ICE [announced](https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2020/Coronavirus%20Guidance_3.13.20.pdf) international students attending a school that temporarily switches to remote instruction due to the pandemic will retain their visa status. The March 13 guidance indicated the provision would remain ""in effect for the duration of the emergency."" The lawsuit points out that President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration has not been rescinded and COVID-19 cases have reached [record highs](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) in recent weeks. . . University President Mark Schlissel [wrote](https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/statements/statement-on-homeland-security-policy-affecting-international-students/) Tuesday the guidance does not interfere with the University's plans for a hybrid fall semester. However, he wrote the University opposes ""arbitrary restrictions"" on international students. . . ""Even with this initial review that shows a less direct impact on our students, we agree with the statement from the Association of American Universities - of which U-M is a member - that calls this policy 'immensely misguided and deeply cruel to the tens of thousands of international students who come to the United States every year,'"" Schlissel wrote.. . According to the University's International Center [website](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/planning-fall-term-2020-new-dhs-procedures-and-u-m-updates), international students must take at least one in-person class under the new guidance. The Registrar's office and schools and colleges are working to finalize course instruction modes by Aug. 7, after which students will be allowed to adjust their schedules to fulfill their immigration requirements. . . The International Center website said the new guidance would only force international students out of the United States if the University transitioned to online only instruction before Nov. 30. . . ""The only scenario in which we make such a switch is if we have severe COVID occurrence in our community and it is deemed absolutely necessary to go online only,"" the website reads.. . The University is also working on reissuing I-20 documents to international students with a statement confirming it is not online-only for the fall.. . Dozens of other [universities](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/08/harvard-mit-visa-rule-international-students-352448) have announced their intent to file briefs in favor for the lawsuit as of Thursday. . .

No one is going to trade their central campus/hill contract for your north campus contract. . . I lived in Bursley my freshman year and the north campus dorms truly are an inferior experience for freshmen. Freshmen engineers generally only have one or two north campus classes a semester, and even the SMTD/Stamps people are generally willing to commute instead of living on north. Trading a central campus contract for a north campus contract is an unequal trade. . . My advice is to make the best of your situation and make quality friends across both campuses. Meet the people in your hall/house and join a frat or a club.. . If you're really dead set on switching you do have a few options. First, there are usually a few vacant spots in East Quad reserved for athletes. These spots usually aren't all taken, so there's a waitlist you can get on to transfer there.

Decide for yourself if this is something you're morally ok with and how much you think living on central is really worth over north. . .

t3_i2y01p,2020-08-03 14:29:07,President Schnissel's reply to the sexual misconduct investigation,"To All Members of the U-M Ann Arbor Community:. . I have spent the last few days reading carefully the [report issued Friday](https://regents.umich.edu/governance/announcements/report-of-independent-investigation-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct-by-martin-a-philbert/) by WilmerHale following their investigation of sexual misconduct allegations against Martin Philbert. The behaviors uncovered by this investigation are both awful and unacceptable, and our institution failed to properly and effectively address earlier reports of Philbert's misconduct despite our often-stated values. . . I apologize to everyone who has been affected by Martin Philbert's misconduct and for our institution's failings.. . The university has fallen far short of creating a culture that rejects harassment and misconduct and ensures that no one in our community fears retaliation for reporting. What kept coming through to me was how many people were badly hurt by Philbert's behavior, but also how afraid they were about coming forward. . . The highest priority for our regents and leadership team is to make our community safe for all. The regents have been stressing with campus leadership the importance of diminishing sexual harassment and misconduct for many years. To achieve this, we will need an environment where it is safe to report, free from the fear of retaliation. It is appalling that we have been unable to accomplish this.. . The University of Michigan Board of Regents engaged the WilmerHale firm in January to conduct an independent investigation of allegations of sexual misconduct by Philbert. The report was released simultaneously to the Board of Regents, the university and the public. The investigation's major findings were [outlined in the University Record](https://record.umich.edu/articles/report-details-decades-of-sexual-misconduct-by-philbert/) on Friday.. . I want to thank everyone in the University of Michigan community who spoke with the investigators, particularly those who bravely reported sexual misconduct by Philbert. During review of the WilmerHale report, I was moved by the incredible courage of the individuals who came forward.. . The report also includes several recommendations that deserve careful consideration, as they could form the basis of necessary new policies and procedures in the months ahead: . . * Establish a standalone policy regarding consensual relationships between employees that requires notice and recusal and/or mitigation of possible conflicts of interest. . . * Ensure that students and employees are aware of the avenues for reporting sexual misconduct. . . * Enhance the visibility and training of University personnel who are required to report information about sexual harassment that is reported to them or that otherwise comes to their attention. . . * Provide alternative oversight of sexual misconduct allegations involving members of the Provost's office, which is ordinarily responsible for overseeing the Office for Institutional Equity (OIE). . . * Conduct a climate survey regarding sexual misconduct for faculty and staff. . . * Evaluate OIE investigative practices to ensure that OIE is identifying and, as appropriate, pursuing additional investigative avenues when complainants decline to participate in an investigation. . . * Establish a process for formally reviewing OIE investigative files to provide quality assurance and confidence in investigation procedures and outcomes. . . * Ensure that findings of policy violations and other misconduct by internal candidates are collected and accessible, and establish a formal written process for obtaining and considering such findings in promotion, tenure, appointment, reappointment, and other hiring decisions involving internal candidates. . . * Review its procedures for vetting external candidates for faculty and staff positions, and consider implementing a pilot program that enhances its ability to identify findings by previous employers of sexual or other misconduct.. . The Board and I, along with the appropriate units, are reviewing the recommendations carefully, and I will report back soon with a way forward on these important issues. We will also have to look beyond these recommendations at additional ways we can make our environment safe for all and free from sexual misconduct and harassment. . . Additionally, we will determine what we need to do to address the fear of retaliation in our community and build a culture that does not accept misconduct or harassment at any level. It is clear from the report that our institution must work to support and empower individuals to report misconduct. The university also needs to develop ways to better capture and, when appropriate, act on anonymous reports and information we receive from those who do not wish to file a formal specific complaint. . . When I received an anonymous letter indicating several allegations of sexual misconduct by Philbert in January, we immediately began an internal investigation, and over the next three days engaged our Division of Public Safety and Security, and directed Philbert not to return to work, as the Board of Regents retained an external firm to handle an independent investigation. . . Subsequently, I placed him on administrative leave, then removed him as provost. He has now relinquished his position as a tenured faculty member and is no longer a U-M employee.. . As part of the WilmerHale investigation, I provided access to all of my documents for their review. It was in those materials where they discovered something I had missed in 2019 - an anonymous allegation of misconduct by Philbert. I sincerely regret that. Had I seen it, I would have reported it immediately to the Office for Institutional Equity for evaluation. . . The findings of this report are deeply distressing, both as to the harms to members of our community and to our institutional failings. The safeguards, policies and procedures we had in place were inadequate. . . I fully agree with our regents that we should make any changes necessary to prevent this from happening ever again.

t3_i3kihm,2020-08-04 14:41:30,Update from Schnissel about the fall,"**Dear Students:**. . I hope you and your loved ones are having a safe, healthy and enjoyable summer. At the University of Michigan, we have spent the last few months preparing diligently to welcome you and begin another academic year.. . The weeks leading up to the start of school are always filled with excitement and some anxiety, and the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly added to everyone's worries.. . I am writing today to share a few of the ways we are working to create a safe and healthy living and learning environment on our campus - and to ask for your help. The pandemic is growing worse in many parts of our nation, and it will take our collective commitment to have a successful academic year.. . The most important measures we can all take are described in the video above.. . * Wear a mask when you're outside your home.. * Wash your hands more frequently.. * Avoid crowded places, especially indoors but also outdoor gatherings. . .

As we continue our extensive preparations for a fall semester that offers a mix of remote, in-person and hybrid courses, I want to provide an update on several major developments. . . We recognize that in many parts of the country and world, COVID-19 is spreading more widely than was the case at the time we announced our initial plan for a public health-informed hybrid residential semester. Also, access to testing, while greatly improved, is once again lagging behind demand, especially when it comes to turnaround time. We continue to monitor the state of the pandemic nationally and locally, and will modify our plans as conditions dictate.. .

We've also heard some great ideas for moving forward. . . Through it all, faculty and staff across the university are doing outstanding work in the face of great and unprecedented challenges. Each component of our mission - education, research, service, and patient care - has been enhanced by your determination and innovative spirit. . . We have less than a month before fall classes begin, and our schools, colleges and academic units are working to protect the health and safety of our community through the Provost's Office's Unit Reentry Planning. Part of this effort includes planning in the event that we must tighten or are able to relax safety measures. . . Our [Workplace Innovation & Staff Experience Committee](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/charge/) is developing guidelines on how best to provide an innovative and safe workplace for U-M staff members, whether they are working remotely or working on-site, now and in the future.. . At least 70 percent of credit hours for undergraduates are being taken fully remotely this fall among those currently registered, with many hybrid courses offering the option to attend remotely as well. This means that a number of students may choose to take their classes fully remotely and not come to Ann Arbor, and a significant majority of faculty teaching will be done remotely this fall. . . We also know that our new international students need to take some in-person or hybrid classes because of federal guidelines and there are many others whose majors involve courses that can only be offered effectively in person. . . We continue to require that everyone who can work from home do so. All campus units are finalizing plans for health and safety to protect faculty and staff who do need to be on campus. Everything we do to decrease on-campus density will make our campus spaces safer for those who are teaching or have to work on campus.. . Here is where we are at on several additional key topics:. . **Pre-arrival COVID-19 testing for students living on campus**. . Undergraduate students moving into U-M Housing's residence halls and apartments will be tested for the virus that causes COVID-19, and be cleared before arriving in Ann Arbor. U-M is partnering with the national testing company Quest Diagnostics to accomplish this. Quest will provide testing kits, at no additional cost to students and families, directly to on-campus housing students at their homes to self-administer and then mail back to Quest for analysis. . . Students who fail to return a test will be tested immediately upon arrival and asked to practice enhanced social distancing until results come back. We are requiring all students, whether they live on campus or not, to practice enhanced social distancing for two weeks before returning to Ann Arbor.. . Any students who test positive will be asked to delay arrival on campus. Current CDC guidelines call for asymptomatic persons who test positive to self-quarantine for 10 days. Students living in our Munger Graduate Residences had an earlier move-in, and they are being tested after arrival. . . We are testing residence hall students because we are asking them to live with us, and they will be in new large-scale community housing environments immediately after arriving. This measure exceeds current [CDC higher education guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/ihe-testing.html), which call for testing of symptomatic individuals and those with recent exposures to someone with COVID-19. . . Students not living in university housing will not undergo pre-arrival screening. They arrive here at different times, and many have been here most of the summer. Their living arrangements differ considerably. Because of these factors, we do not believe pre-arrival testing would be efficient or effective. As noted above, they will be required to adhere to enhanced social distancing for two weeks before class begins.. . One significant factor that influences our thinking on opening our residence halls and hosting a limited amount of in-person instruction is that surveys, as well as our experience last spring, indicate that a large fraction of our students will return to Ann Arbor to occupy their leased residences, be with their friends, and study remotely rather than stay at home around the state or country regardless of whether there is any in-person instruction. Therefore, overall risk of disease transmission in Ann Arbor might not be affected greatly were we to go fully remote, and many think that being linked to campus will result in improved adherence to public health guidance.. . **Enhanced social distancing prior to arrival**. . All U.S. students coming to Ann Arbor will be asked to practice enhanced social distancing during the 14 days before arriving on campus. During this 14-day period, students have been directed to monitor their health, reduce contact with others and follow guidance consistent with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These include:. . . . * Taking their temperature two times a day and monitoring for fever.. * Watching for cough, trouble breathing or additional COVID-19 symptoms.. * Staying home and avoiding contact with others outside of their homes, including not going to work, school or social gatherings.. * Avoiding public transportation, taxis or ride-shares.. * Maintaining a physical distance from others (about 6 feet).. * Wearing a face covering when in public settings or while interacting with others outside of the home.. * Seeking medical attention if they develop a fever, other symptoms and/or test positive for COVID-19. They will then be asked not to come to campus until they receive further instructions.. . For students arriving on campus directly from international locations, the 14 days of enhanced social distancing begins when they arrive, and can be done in the students' residences. This may overlap with the start of classes, and students will be expected not to go to (in-person) class until the 14-day period is complete. Student Life has emphasized the importance of communicating with instructors directly to determine appropriate academic adjustments during this period. . . We'll also ask students to complete an online learning module that includes important information on COVID-19.. . **During the semester**. . We are preparing to implement a carefully crafted response to how we handle suspected or positive cases of COVID-19. These measures include:. . . . * We'll offer testing for students when indicated through our University Health Service. Testing is offered for those who are symptomatic or who meet [specific criteria](https://uhs.umich.edu/2019-nCoV). These tests will be performed through Michigan Medicine with a fast turnaround time to increase the effectiveness of contact tracing.. * We'll continue to work closely with local public health officials to perform contact tracing for all infected students and employees as has occurred throughout the pandemic. We will use public health students trained and supervised by professionals to enhance our contact tracing capacity. These students will also get appropriate course credit for this clinical activity as part of their curricular requirements.. * We'll support and provide living space and meal delivery for any student who develops symptoms or tests positive and needs to quarantine or isolate safely. Including rooms we have set aside on campus for quarantine and isolation and possible overflow needs off campus, we expect to have space for 600 students at a time. As we saw in the spring, students who live nearby may choose to quarantine or isolate at home. We expect only a small fraction of this number to be students who test positive for the virus, the majority being close contacts who are being quarantined for 14 days.. * We have created an [online symptom checker tool](https://healthscreen.umich.edu/) so members of our community can check any symptoms daily. Many are already using it. We're modifying the tool for students, and it will be available later this month. The tool automatically refers users to appropriate medical follow-up based on daily results.. * Our Division of Student Life worked closely with U-M students across campus this summer to develop the [Wolverine Culture of Care](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/uploads/Wolverine_Culture_of_Care%20sign_8.5x11_UPDATED_071520.pdf) - a commitment to keeping the U-M campus community as healthy and safe as possible. . * We are working on a plan to perform surveillance testing of students in residence halls. . * As is the case now, faculty and staff who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms are referred to their primary care provider or Occupational Health Services.. . **Contact tracing**. . Responsibility for contact tracing is vested in the Washtenaw County Health Department, which delegates authority for U-M to our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Department. EHS performs contact tracing for all U-M employees and students and has been doing so throughout the pandemic.. . As noted above, in collaboration with the county and University Health Service, EHS is organizing and training a mix of professional contact tracers and professional students from our School of Public Health who will assist with student contact tracing. I commend those in the SPH community for stepping up and using their expertise. . . **Risk assessment**. . The work of the [COVID-19 Campus Health Response Committee](https://president.umich.edu/committees/u-m-covid-19-committees/), chaired by Dr. Rob Ernst (executive director of the University Health Service), is underway, and this group is responsible for the timely tracking and parsing of information, coordinating key U-M offices, and providing expert advice and recommendations to university leaders. This is key for us as conditions change. . . Additionally, I will say again that we're continuing to monitor the spread of the coronavirus in Michigan and beyond and will be ready to adapt our plans as needed. Conditions change daily, and I'm thankful that we have continued access to experts in public health and safety who are deeply devoted to our community and will serve as a key resource as we make decisions moving forward. . . Our public health advisory group has suggested a set of criteria we will use to determine whether spread of COVID-19 during the semester requires closure of a residence hall or other campus spaces or even a reversal of our plans and a transition to a fully remote semester. Data we will follow to arrive at these decisions include:. . . . * Epidemiological measures of regional and campus disease activity.. * Assessment of both ambulatory clinical resources on campus and hospital and health system capacity.. * Availability of case investigation, contact tracing and quarantine space resources.. . We are working with a group from SPH who are developing a campus- and Ann Arbor-specific model of COVID-19 spread that will allow us to predict the direction of the pandemic locally and model the effectiveness of potential interventions. This same group developed the model that is being used by Governor Whitmer and her team in managing the state's response to the pandemic.. . Faculty from our School of Public Health are conducting a study that is monitoring environmental contamination of the coronavirus in U-M spaces and evaluating the exposure risk. The researchers' work seeks to add understanding around exposures in workplaces and educational and residential settings. . . **Learning as we work**. . As you know, our research enterprise has been reactivating for much of the summer. More than 7,000 University of Michigan researchers have resumed their important work. There is no indication of any virus transmission between laboratory or research coworkers at work, though there have been three positive COVID-19 cases among these approximately 7,000 faculty, students and staff working in our labs this summer. EHS is performing the contact tracing, and the individuals who've tested positive are isolating. . . Many of the measures we are putting in place for fall align with what we've done in our research labs and in Michigan Medicine facilities. We're [requiring face coverings](https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/letters-to-the-community/announcing-an-updated-policy-for-face-coverings-and-additional-covid-19-planning-information/) on all campus property and transportation, controlling density, telling anyone who is sick to stay home, and [promoting research-based health and safety practices](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/care). . . All of this is possible because of your dedication to our university, colleagues, friends, loved ones and students. . . I thank you for your outstanding work and appreciate your passion for ensuring that our university is as safe as possible for all.

We are testing residence hall students because we are asking them to live with us, and they will be in new large-scale community housing environments immediately after arriving. This measure exceeds current [CDC higher education guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/ihe-testing.html), which call for testing of symptomatic individuals and those with recent exposures to someone with COVID-19. . . Students not living in university housing will not undergo pre-arrival screening. They arrive here at different times, and many have been here most of the summer. Their living arrangements differ considerably. Because of these factors, we do not believe pre-arrival testing would be efficient or effective. As noted above, they will be required to adhere to enhanced social distancing for two weeks before class begins.. . One significant factor that influences our thinking on opening our residence halls and hosting a limited amount of in-person instruction is that surveys, as well as our experience last spring, indicate that a large fraction of our students will return to Ann Arbor to occupy their leased residences, be with their friends, and study remotely rather than stay at home around the state or country regardless of whether there is any in-person instruction. Therefore, overall risk of disease transmission in Ann Arbor might not be affected greatly were we to go fully remote, and many think that being linked to campus will result in improved adherence to public health guidance.. . **Enhanced social distancing prior to arrival**. . All U.S. students coming to Ann Arbor will be asked to practice enhanced social distancing during the 14 days before arriving on campus. During this 14-day period, students have been directed to monitor their health, reduce contact with others and follow guidance consistent with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These include:. . . . * Taking their temperature two times a day and monitoring for fever.. * Watching for cough, trouble breathing or additional COVID-19 symptoms.. * Staying home and avoiding contact with others outside of their homes, including not going to work, school or social gatherings.. * Avoiding public transportation, taxis or ride-shares.. * Maintaining a physical distance from others (about 6 feet).. * Wearing a face covering when in public settings or while interacting with others outside of the home.. * Seeking medical attention if they develop a fever, other symptoms and/or test positive for COVID-19. They will then be asked not to come to campus until they receive further instructions.. . For students arriving on campus directly from international locations, the 14 days of enhanced social distancing begins when they arrive, and can be done in the students' residences. This may overlap with the start of classes, and students will be expected not to go to (in-person) class until the 14-day period is complete. Student Life has emphasized the importance of communicating with instructors directly to determine appropriate academic adjustments during this period. . . We'll also ask students to complete an online learning module that includes important information on COVID-19.. . **During the semester**. . We are preparing to implement a carefully crafted response to how we handle suspected or positive cases of COVID-19. These measures include:. . . . * We'll offer testing for students when indicated through our University Health Service. Testing is offered for those who are symptomatic or who meet [specific criteria](https://uhs.umich.edu/2019-nCoV). These tests will be performed through Michigan Medicine with a fast turnaround time to increase the effectiveness of contact tracing.. * We'll continue to work closely with local public health officials to perform contact tracing for all infected students and employees as has occurred throughout the pandemic. We will use public health students trained and supervised by professionals to enhance our contact tracing capacity. These students will also get appropriate course credit for this clinical activity as part of their curricular requirements.. * We'll support and provide living space and meal delivery for any student who develops symptoms or tests positive and needs to quarantine or isolate safely. Including rooms we have set aside on campus for quarantine and isolation and possible overflow needs off campus, we expect to have space for 600 students at a time. As we saw in the spring, students who live nearby may choose to quarantine or isolate at home. We expect only a small fraction of this number to be students who test positive for the virus, the majority being close contacts who are being quarantined for 14 days.. * We have created an [online symptom checker tool](https://healthscreen.umich.edu/) so members of our community can check any symptoms daily. Many are already using it. We're modifying the tool for students, and it will be available later this month. The tool automatically refers users to appropriate medical follow-up based on daily results.. * Our Division of Student Life worked closely with U-M students across campus this summer to develop the [Wolverine Culture of Care](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/uploads/Wolverine_Culture_of_Care%20sign_8.5x11_UPDATED_071520.pdf) - a commitment to keeping the U-M campus community as healthy and safe as possible. . * We are working on a plan to perform surveillance testing of students in residence halls. . * As is the case now, faculty and staff who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms are referred to their primary care provider or Occupational Health Services.. . **Contact tracing**. . Responsibility for contact tracing is vested in the Washtenaw County Health Department, which delegates authority for U-M to our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Department. EHS performs contact tracing for all U-M employees and students and has been doing so throughout the pandemic.. . As noted above, in collaboration with the county and University Health Service, EHS is organizing and training a mix of professional contact tracers and professional students from our School of Public Health who will assist with student contact tracing. I commend those in the SPH community for stepping up and using their expertise. . . **Risk assessment**. . The work of the [COVID-19 Campus Health Response Committee](https://president.umich.edu/committees/u-m-covid-19-committees/), chaired by Dr. Rob Ernst (executive director of the University Health Service), is underway, and this group is responsible for the timely tracking and parsing of information, coordinating key U-M offices, and providing expert advice and recommendations to university leaders. This is key for us as conditions change. . . Additionally, I will say again that we're continuing to monitor the spread of the coronavirus in Michigan and beyond and will be ready to adapt our plans as needed. Conditions change daily, and I'm thankful that we have continued access to experts in public health and safety who are deeply devoted to our community and will serve as a key resource as we make decisions moving forward. . . Our public health advisory group has suggested a set of criteria we will use to determine whether spread of COVID-19 during the semester requires closure of a residence hall or other campus spaces or even a reversal of our plans and a transition to a fully remote semester. Data we will follow to arrive at these decisions include:. . . . * Epidemiological measures of regional and campus disease activity.. * Assessment of both ambulatory clinical resources on campus and hospital and health system capacity.. * Availability of case investigation, contact tracing and quarantine space resources.. . We are working with a group from SPH who are developing a campus- and Ann Arbor-specific model of COVID-19 spread that will allow us to predict the direction of the pandemic locally and model the effectiveness of potential interventions. This same group developed the model that is being used by Governor Whitmer and her team in managing the state's response to the pandemic.. . Faculty from our School of Public Health are conducting a study that is monitoring environmental contamination of the coronavirus in U-M spaces and evaluating the exposure risk. The researchers' work seeks to add understanding around exposures in workplaces and educational and residential settings. . . **Learning as we work**. . As you know, our research enterprise has been reactivating for much of the summer. More than 7,000 University of Michigan researchers have resumed their important work. There is no indication of any virus transmission between laboratory or research coworkers at work, though there have been three positive COVID-19 cases among these approximately 7,000 faculty, students and staff working in our labs this summer. EHS is performing the contact tracing, and the individuals who've tested positive are isolating. . . Many of the measures we are putting in place for fall align with what we've done in our research labs and in Michigan Medicine facilities. We're [requiring face coverings](https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/letters-to-the-community/announcing-an-updated-policy-for-face-coverings-and-additional-covid-19-planning-information/) on all campus property and transportation, controlling density, telling anyone who is sick to stay home, and [promoting research-based health and safety practices](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/care). . . All of this is possible because of your dedication to our university, colleagues, friends, loved ones and students. . . I thank you for your outstanding work and appreciate your passion for ensuring that our university is as safe as possible for all. We will continue to update you as conditions evolve as the semester approaches.. . Sincerely,. . Mark S. Schlissel, M.D., Ph.D. . President",error,0.0

If they're already making us wait all summer to find out if we can afford to go to school, I'd appreciate it if they could send out the right information the first time? . . I've gotten a new award notice three weeks in a row, and today's is giving me half the money I had last week. I started with a single grant. I understand that scholarships usually come later, so I waited a week. Last week I was happy to realize my scholarship had been applied and I actually had enough money to cover tuition and get a bit of a refund to use towards rent.

t3_icagia,2020-08-18 21:44:07,Schlissel email to staff outlining testing strategy -- TLDR: they can't test everyone,"Dear Colleagues,. . We want to thank many of you for sharing your concerns about the coming fall semester with your department chairs, your deans or directors and with me and the provost directly. We know there is trepidation about the return of students to our campus community and we want to assure you we have consulted widely with our own and outside experts in public health and believe that we are taking appropriate measures to keep our community safe. We will continue to evaluate circumstances and change our plans as necessary.. . As we ramp up to welcome a reduced number of students, faculty and staff back to campus, our goal is to continue to serve our mission to the greatest extent possible, while balancing that with the health and safety of everyone involved. Short of a total lockdown, there is nothing we can do right now as individuals, as a university, or as a society that does not involve risk and mitigation strategies.. . We hope you had the opportunity last week to listen to the faculty-focused town hall discussion moderated by College of Literature, Science, and the Arts Dean Anne Curzan or the staff-focused meeting moderated by Executive Vice President Kevin Hegarty. It was helpful to hear questions directly from members of the community, and we hope the responses were helpful to you and others.. . The university's plans are informed by the latest safety measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state of Michigan and the guidance of U-M experts from public health, education, medicine, engineering and others across our campus community. We recognize that these are complex issues about which thoughtful people will disagree.. . Testing. . Our strategy around screening tests for virus infection in community members without symptoms has elicited many questions. We welcome this opportunity to summarize the testing regimen we will follow as well as to explain the rationale and the range of considerations that underlie these decisions.. . From a public health and safety perspective, testing is one of the many tools we have integrated into our public health-informed practices to reactivate in-person activities on campus. Testing identifies those who are sick and does not itself prevent the disease of course, which is why we have incorporated testing as an integrated part of our layered approach.. . All students will be expected to practice enhanced social distancing for two weeks before coming to Ann Arbor, and students moving into our residence halls and apartments will be tested for COVID-19 before they arrive on campus. Those who test positive will have to remain at home for at least 10 days before coming to Ann Arbor. Students who arrive on campus not having been tested will be given a test and limited in their interactions until results are back. These interventions will decrease the number of students who unknowingly bring disease back to our community.. . Anyone who is symptomatic will be tested, with students tested through University Health Service and university faculty and staff tested through their health care providers. We have set aside 600 single rooms for isolation or quarantine for students if needed. And we are training a team of public health and other graduate students who will serve as contact tracers, under professional guidance, for our campus community.. . Health tracking. . Each day, all members of our community coming to campus will be expected to check themselves for COVID-19 symptoms by answering a brief set of questions using our daily symptom checker tool, which offers advice on where to seek care if you are not well. We will be rolling out new features of this tool - now called ResponsiBLUE - in the coming days, including making it available as an Apple or Android smartphone app.. . There also will be surveillance testing of several thousand students, faculty and staff each week on a random opt-in basis throughout the semester (statistical approaches will be used by public health faculty experts to correct for the sample biases introduced by using an opt-in approach). We anticipate screening around 3,000-3,500 individuals weekly, based on a program developed by Emily Martin, an infectious disease epidemiologist and associate professor in our School of Public Health. This testing can be focused on highest risk individuals, especially those living in communal housing. At this time, there is nothing from public health guidance that suggests we should be conducting widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals.. . We are aware of the efforts by other universities to develop and implement new homegrown tests that are in effect start-up research, although a few of these have recently received emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The challenge with mass testing at other institutions is that it has not yet been implemented, so the approach has yet to be proven to be effective.. . Other testing efforts. . Many questions remain surrounding the sensitivity and specificity of these homegrown, high-throughput tests. To the extent that COVID-19 is an asymptomatic infection with a low prevalence, the number of false positives might result in hundreds of uninfected students being mistakenly identified every week, each requiring follow-up placing a drain on our case investigation and quarantine capacity. Furthermore, a false positive test might cause tremendous stress and anxiety. In addition, an inaccurate test can provide false assurance to a student whose subsequent behavior might then result in an increased likelihood of disease spread.. . Although the proposed testing programs at Cornell and Illinois are being discussed as ""standards,"" there actually is not a standard approach that has been rigorously evaluated. . . Focusing on asymptomatic testing draws resources from symptomatic testing, quarantine, contact tracing, and behavior modification. Our advisory groups feel it is important to put time and energy on what matters the most. The essential aspects of mitigation include physical distancing, masks, handwashing, screening, etc. . . Testing capacity. . Our current testing capacity remains limiting as well. Michigan Medicine has a total testing capacity of about 10,000 tests per week. While this number is expected to increase in coming weeks and months, the overall capacity is monitored closely. Our top priority for testing remains individuals with suspected COVID-19 followed by asymptomatic individuals with recent exposure to the virus. Large-scale testing of asymptomatic individuals for public health surveillance is the lowest priority for this limited resource and may limit or slow down testing for those with symptoms. . . The resources required to collect, process and follow up on more than 15,000 results a day far exceeds what our infrastructure can currently support. Indeed, at this point, testing all students, faculty and staff on a twice a week basis would represent more than half the total number of tests currently being done in the entire state of Michigan. Furthermore, the purely logistical challenge of performing ongoing testing on this scale, especially of students, has been illustrated at other institutions. . . Other experiences also suggest that after a few weeks, non-compliance among students might become common and we see many problems with making such testing mandatory or linking it to building access as some schools have done. Nonetheless, we will track the experience with frequent mass testing at other institutions and move in that direction if efficacy is proven and testing at that level becomes possible for us as new tests are developed and implemented here. Our clinical diagnostic labs at Michigan Medicine are currently evaluating self-administered saliva and nasal swab testing as developed by the University of Illinois and by Yale for potential implementation in broader screening efforts on campus and in our community.. . Lowering density. . The density of students will be lower than normal as we do not expect all U-M students to return to Ann Arbor this fall. At this point in time we know that about 70 percent of credit hours for undergraduates will be taken fully remotely, with many hybrid courses offering the option to attend remotely as well. For students who do choose to come back to Ann Arbor, we have made numerous preparations to keep the community as safe as possible, from a universal face-covering requirement to efforts to reduce density in buildings and restricting seating in dining halls. Crowding in buildings and across the Diag will be diminished due to the absence of large courses (greater than 50 students) that meet in person. . . We have reason to be encouraged from our recent experiences in Michigan Medicine, in our research community, and with our graduate and professional students. Serology studies (that test for antibodies) have revealed rates of SARS-CoV-2 in our frontline healthcare workers lower than that found in many communities despite their high levels of exposure to COVID-19 patients. We have reactivated our research labs with up to 7,000 persons per day coming to our buildings with only four documented cases of COVID-19 and no spread within our facilities. And finally, we've had more than 1,500 graduate and professional students living on campus and thousands more pursuing their studies here this summer with very low infection rates.. . Please take a look at our several recent communications to students, families, staff and faculty for further details.. . There certainly is no way to completely eliminate personal risk, but we believe that by implementing a set of layered approaches, the campus will be able to serve its mission with approximately the same level of safety for employees that is involved when going to a supermarket, dining with your family outdoors on Main Street, or sitting in a backyard at a distance with friends.. . Because the situation regarding the spread of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly, the university has posted information on fall planning efforts and updates for the U-M community on a dedicated Maize & Blueprint website. One new element that will be added in the coming week is a dashboard of COVID-19 activity in our community. It will be updated weekly.. . Campus experts and leaders will continue to track disease metrics on campus and in the surrounding area, our capacity to test and perform contact tracing, our quarantine space and the status of our health system and will pull back if the situation dictates.. .

The meeting, which was asked to be recorded and subsequently declined, consisted of \~5-10 members of leadership staff/team (LT) and approximately 100+ RAs, the majority of whom were anonymous.. . The meeting, prepended by a 2-3 page letter of clear actionable items, was scheduled to be from 7pm to 8pm, the first 30 minutes, unexaggerated, were spent on lengthy and unwanted bibliographies of the leadership staff. Students were asked to send messages to LT to be selected and responded to. At 7:45, realizing the entire call had largely been wasted with nonanswers, student staff began unmuting to request additional meetings or extensions to the meeting, marking the tipping point, afterwhich student staff proceeded to collectively drag the leadership/admin team for 45 minutes straight for nonanswers to clear action items provided in the prior letter.

RAs were concerned with the structure of being On Duty // On Call, and the requirements to navigate every accessible area of their building during Rounds for 2-3 times per night, putting them in ""every area we could possibly get coronavirus from"" and feeling insecure about protections. Concerns were echoed about the need to intervene during dorm parties, which could include dense clusters of mask-free, intoxicated, judgement-impaired individuals, and resulted in calls to revisit the structure of RA on Duty obligations.. . **Nonconcern for Accountability?:** A staff member indicated in their training module that they were not to enforce the no-guest policy unless raised as an issue by other residents. Questions were asked about punitive enforcement of policy, towhich admin responded that they would continue pursuing ""restorative justice,"" which was then also dragged as woefully undereffective at damage control and harm prevention due to focusing on post-incidental restoration and education.

Also, staff members provided two masks, which must be, by policy, washed immediately after use, are insufficient for those working chronically during move-in week.

I wasn't planning on going to get my COVID kit, but I figured AA was on the way to a quick trip my family was taking, so we went there today.. . Online, it says in the case of inclement weather, they have alternative distribution sites (Hatcher for central campus). So.... please enlighten me, housing administration, why was the distribution canceled for today? I called student life and they just said ""it's been canceled."". . For someone that lives over 2.5 hours away, it doesn't make sense for me to just drive back, when you shouldn't have rescheduled in the first place anyway. I also drive through a fucking thunderstorm so you'd think staying inside and distributing a kit wouldn't be that hard.. . So. You don't mail out the covid kits to students who are paying for it and living not in AA, and you can't even bother to STICK TO your alternative pick up sites so you just randomly decide to cancel? . .

Class topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation, writing for graduate students, reading) to topic-based (i.e. Southern culture, American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the teaching opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still welcome those who are not. While the type of class that you will teach (a more casual conversation hour format vs. one on pronunciation) will depend on your background, knowledge, and experience, anyone from freshmen to graduate students can participate.. . For this semester, all of these classes will be virtual and will begin the week of Monday, September 14th. Classes typically meet once a week for around an hour and there's a lot of flexibility for the day/time that they can be taught. In addition to these classes being open to all UM international students, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (UIUC, MSU, UGA, etc.) this Fall since everyone is virtual anyway. This means that an international student from UM can participate in a class led by someone at UIUC, and vice-versa.. .

Gotta say, didn't quite expect a provost email at 11:18pm . . *Dear University of Michigan Ann Arbor Graduate Students:*. . *As you most likely already know, the Graduate Employees' Organization (GEO) intends to strike starting tomorrow, Tuesday, September 8, 2020. We learned only today that the Union will strike tomorrow. I write now, to explain some of the issues we have been discussing with GEO, to affirm the importance of graduate student perspectives and student activism at the University of Michigan but also to inform you that if you are a GSI or GSSA, it is the University's hope and expectation that you will continue to perform the important work that you do to serve our undergraduate students, other graduate students and the rest of the University. Although graduate students who are members of GEO may have voted to strike, individual graduate students are not obligated or required to strike. We expect all employees, including our graduate instructors, to fulfill their employment obligations fully and faithfully and are asking you not to engage in this work stoppage. There are other ways to engage with university leadership, and to have a voice.*. . *Some of you may not be aware that a strike would be illegal. Under Michigan law, public employees, including graduate student employees, may not strike. In addition, GEO's recently signed contract (April 2020), which covers all GSIs and GSSAs, also prohibits them and the Union from interfering with the University's operations, including through a strike. Both Michigan law and the collective bargaining agreement stipulate that the way for GEO to affect change on the important issues it has raised in the past several weeks, must be through discussions with the University (e.g. bargaining) on employment-related issues and not by withholding services.* . . *The law also stipulates that this bargaining can take place only on issues related to the employment of GSIs, not on issues related to your status as a student or issues relevant to the broader University community. GEO's strike is based on a number of issues, many of which are not related to the wages, hours, and working conditions of GSIs and GSSAs. However, as noted below, we understand that these issues are extremely important to many in our community; I certainly affirm the rights of graduate students to voice their perspectives and concerns, and note that there are a range of ways to do so.*. . *Nonetheless, the University's representatives and GEO's representatives have been working diligently since June, including all weekend, to address the concerns GEO has raised and to avert the potential illegal strike. In particular, GEO's representatives have met multiple times with representatives from my office, Academic Human Resources, Rackham Dean Mike Solomon, the International Center leadership, and our public health experts. We believe progress has been made on key issues, including those that do relate to employment concerns. Unfortunately, and despite our efforts, GEO has expressed its intention to strike tomorrow.*. . *The University also continues its work on a number of important issues that concern the overall graduate student experience. We recognize the challenges many graduate students are facing that may have impeded their academic progress. Rackham Graduate School has been evaluating the time-to-degree policy for doctoral students, in light of Covid-19 impacts. This topic will be addressed in the upcoming* [*September 14 State of the Graduate School event*](https://rackham.umich.edu/event/state-of-the-graduate-school/)*. We have also been very concerned about the additional visa, travel and other difficulties many of our international students are confronting. Our International Center is focused on efforts to expand its operations, including adding staff as their needs dictate, in order to address the needs of our international students.*. . *And, of course, our public health experts are working nearly around-the-clock to ensure we take necessary and prudent steps throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. We announced this past week a surveillance testing program to help us detect and contain spread of COVID-19. We recognize that there is a range of views on each of these issues, and are expanding opportunities for engagement and to share information across campus. These are complex issues that require thoughtful deliberations, much analysis, and cannot be solved shortsightedly.*. . *Let me briefly address two specific issues raised by GEO during impact negotiations - the universal right to work remotely without documentation and the availability of the child care subsidy without regard to the licensed status of the provider. The University feels it has addressed both of these issues. First, we are not aware of any graduate student who is being required to teach in person against their expressed preference. Faculty and GSIs have been treated identically under the guidance put forth by my office. Second, the University recognizes that due to the pandemic there are increased child care needs and is providing support through the CARES funding for Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students (*[*https://obp.umich.edu/mandatory-reporting/cares-act-reporting/*](https://obp.umich.edu/mandatory-reporting/cares-act-reporting/)*) and through dedicated Rackham Financial Aid for child care, including unlicensed facilities. These funds are available to all students facing challenges during the pandemic and supplement the child care subsidy for licensed facilities available through the Office of Financial Aid.*. . *I end by reaffirming my commitment to working collaboratively to create and maintain a university environment in which graduate students - and all members of our community - can thrive. This certainly includes building on our efforts to combat racism, as an essential priority for our university, and to provide an education rooted in the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.*. . *I hope you will join me in reaffirming your commitment to the UM mission to deliver a world-class education, safely and effectively.*. . *Best,*. . *Susan M.

These are complex issues that require thoughtful deliberations, much analysis, and cannot be solved shortsightedly.*. . *Let me briefly address two specific issues raised by GEO during impact negotiations - the universal right to work remotely without documentation and the availability of the child care subsidy without regard to the licensed status of the provider. The University feels it has addressed both of these issues. First, we are not aware of any graduate student who is being required to teach in person against their expressed preference. Faculty and GSIs have been treated identically under the guidance put forth by my office. Second, the University recognizes that due to the pandemic there are increased child care needs and is providing support through the CARES funding for Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students (*[*https://obp.umich.edu/mandatory-reporting/cares-act-reporting/*](https://obp.umich.edu/mandatory-reporting/cares-act-reporting/)*) and through dedicated Rackham Financial Aid for child care, including unlicensed facilities. These funds are available to all students facing challenges during the pandemic and supplement the child care subsidy for licensed facilities available through the Office of Financial Aid.*. . *I end by reaffirming my commitment to working collaboratively to create and maintain a university environment in which graduate students - and all members of our community - can thrive. This certainly includes building on our efforts to combat racism, as an essential priority for our university, and to provide an education rooted in the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.*. . *I hope you will join me in reaffirming your commitment to the UM mission to deliver a world-class education, safely and effectively.*. . *Best,*. . *Susan M. CollinsProvost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs*",error,0.0

t3_ip0qhs,2020-09-08 19:51:00,Can we please have a serious discussion about the police-oriented demands in the GEO strike?,"To preface this, I want to make it clear that I am aware that the GEO strike is centered around many more issues and concerns than just campus policing. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the primary impetus behind the strike seems to be concerns regarding COVID-19 policies (or lack thereof). However, I have heard first-hand from multiple GSI's that the goal is that ALL demands are to be met by the university. So, I think that regardless of anyone's thoughts or opinions on any other components of the demands, it would be worthwhile to have a serious discussion surrounding the police-oriented demands.. . To get the discussion going, I want to share my two cents. As someone who was born and raised in Ann Arbor, I can confidently say that my experiences with the AAPD have only been overwhelmingly positive. I have multiple female friends who navigated their way out of potentially dangerous situations with the direct help and support of AAPD officers. I had a male friend in high school who was assaulted by a homeless man who was likely under the influence of some hard drugs, and it was only with the aid of an AAPD officer who witnessed the event first-hand that my friend was able to get away safely and without further harm done to him. Again in high school, I once witnessed two men beating one man in front of the Blake Transit Center in downtown Ann Arbor after stealing his hat. I saw an AAPD officer respond to the scene within minutes and arrest one of the perpetrators (the other fled upon his arrival).. . During my time as a college student, I have only had positive interactions with DPSS officers. A girl once wiped out on her skateboard in front of my house while going the wrong way down the middle of a one-way street. She appeared hurt, and a DPSS vehicle that happened to drive by soon afterwards stopped to help her. Despite her engaging in reckless and possibly illegal behavior, the officer who emerged from the vehicle was exclusively charitable and kind. The officer offered her aid and asked if the girl would like to have an ambulance called. After the girl said no, the officer informed her that so long as she was just checked out by the responding paramedics and didn't actually go to the hospital, she would not be billed. After the girl attested that she would be okay, the officer hung around until the girl got going again, and then left without further pressure of any sort. . . I also had an older housemate living with me for part of the summer one year. He was in very poor health, and would park his motorcycle in the front yard so he could access it more readily. His bike would often take a long time to start and he would really annoy the neighbors with the noise involved in this process. One day, it was taking especially long and a neighbor must have called the police. The officer who arrived was nothing but cordial with my housemate and spent about 20 minutes helping him figure out what was wrong with the vehicle. With the officer's assistance, the motorcycle was actually repaired, and no ticketing or fines of any sort were issued.. . Based on every experience that I have ever had with campus and local police, as well as every experience friends of mine have shared with me, it genuinely surprised me to see the police-oriented demands listed as part of the GEO's strike. Demanding that the university cut ties with the AAPD and massively cut the budget of the DPSS seems unproductive at best, and potentially dangerous at worst. But I am more than open to hearing out the other side of this issue. I sincerely want to understand where people who support these specific demands are coming from. So please, regardless of how you feel about this matter, share your thoughts. I think that constructive discussion is always healthy, and this seems to be a good platform to host that discussion.

t3_ipci53,2020-09-09 09:06:29,Why I think the GEO strike will fail,"This is not a post about whether or not they're right to strike or whether I support them - some of y'all already know my opinion on that. This is just my prediction on the outcome.. . . . 1) The most important reason I think this is that not everyone is striking. To have an effective strike, (a) everyone in that job has to withhold labour, and (b) no one can do their job. This strike doesn't have (a). Not only is not every GSI a member of GEO, but some GSIs I personally know in GEO are not striking. Only around half the GSIs in the classes I'm taking are striking. I even know a GSI who voted ""Yes"" to authorize a strike who will not be striking for more than a few days - so don't make the mistake of assuming that because 79% voted yes to authorize a strike, that 79% will strike.. . . 2) Not only is (a) not being met, but (b) is also not being met - even those courses where the GSIs are striking for the long haul, professors can make non-vital changes to the course and pick up the slack where necessary. Remember, GSIs only work ~15-20 hours a week. Yes it's gonna mean less office hours, fewer discussion sections, grading delays; the course might get shittier but it'll definitely survive. Plus many courses have IAs who only work 10 hours a week but in many cases would love to work more - I could see the department temporarily approving them to work more hours to pick up the GSIs slack.. . . . So there you have it. **TL;DR:** The GSIs aren't a united front - many classes will be just fine, many will get substantially worse but still manageable. This is not enough to create the pressure required to get the university to concede to their demands. Meaning at the end of the day, the only thing this strike's gonna accomplish is make this mostly remote semester that much shittier. Administration doesn't *care* if course quality suffers a bit.. . . **If I were Schlissel**: I would take advantage of the fact that only a fraction of GSIs are striking - that's already a major blow to the striking GSIs morale. I would work that weak point by scaring striking GSIs with disciplinary action. A really scary looking email would suffice. This and the fact that the GSIs are disunited in their strike action would serve to make a bunch more GSIs end their strike. With a gutted morale, Schlissel will make a token concession which GEO will accept so they can say they won, and end the strike.. . . An Important Consideration: In situations like this, support for the strike (among GSIs and the student body in general) is always over-estimated because people against it are going to be shy about voicing their opinion for fear of ostracization and being seen as a ""traitor"", a ""shab"" or ""against students/safety"".",0,"Why I think the GEO strike will fail.

As you probably know, and as the Provost emailed you about, yesterday the Graduate Employees' Organization (GEO) at the University of Michigan began a strike. As a result, many GSIs and other graduate employees have canceled course sections and other work. Many of you have had classes canceled. I recognize that this is very disruptive, especially during the second week of the semester, as you figure out whether your classes are meeting, how you'll get your work done, how you personally feel about the strike, and perhaps whether you feel comfortable crossing a picket line to go to a class or a study space or a lab. I am sorry.. . Discussions on a number of matters are proceeding between GEO and the Provost's office, and I very much hope that there will be a successful resolution very soon. In the meantime, we are moving as quickly as we can in LSA to provide continuous instruction in your courses. Given the sheer size of the college, however, we won't be able to fully cover all classes this week. If you have questions or concerns about particular courses, please contact the appropriate department directly. Please also be sure to reach out to your academic advisors for help--there is a whole team here to support you. . . The LSA Dean's Office has stated our expectation that all instructors will continue to fulfill their teaching responsibilities this week. The strike violates the terms of the contract GEO signed last spring: GEO agreed by contract not to take actions that interfere with the University's operations, which includes your education. GEO has raised many important concerns, including ones we know many of you care deeply about as well; most of these issues, however, are beyond the scope of their contract. . . One concern GEO raised, and which some of you have asked about, is the safety of instructors amid the pandemic. LSA is committed to the safety of all instructors as well as students, and we know of no LSA instructor--faculty or GSI--who has been required to teach in person against their preferences or needs. This has been very important to us.. . Graduate students do vital work at the university and in LSA. Almost all of you have worked with--or will work with--GSIs in your time as an LSA student, and I know those connections can be very meaningful and even life-changing parts of your education. We in LSA feel very fortunate to work with some of the best graduate students in the country, and we are grateful for everything they contribute to our excellence as a college. . . I sincerely hope that GEO and the Provost's office are able to resolve these disputes quickly, knowing that all of us are eager to return to classes as soon as possible.

There is currently a backlog of unsorted mail. So far, we have not been given any instruction on what to do regarding mail. We were told by a staff member that it is unrealistic to expect any CCAs to be added. . . \-In addition to the RAs staffing the CC in their native buildings, there are also RAs that have been assigned to work in multiple CCs across different buildings.

t3_iqxayb,2020-09-11 19:20:16,Schnissel and Collins update,". . Dear Students and Colleagues: . . We write to you today out of a deep concern for our university community - one that feels fractured, with some expressing frustration, anger and distrust. This comes in the context of an extremely high level of anxiety and uncertainty due to the many national crises we are grappling with - from the pandemic to the economy to structural racism - all in the midst of a contentious national election landscape.. . We thank each of you for the questions, concerns and fears you have brought to us about the health and safety of the campus community. We recognize that we must do more to engage with and include members of our community as we grapple with the complex decisions to be made going forward. Working, studying and living through a global pandemic requires all of us to manage a host of challenges and we, like you, are working tirelessly to provide resources to support you, to help you pursue your ambitions, and to keep our community safe. . . Many of you are following the strikes on campus - by our graduate students and resident advisors- and are concerned about the issues they are raising. Health and safety are fundamental human rights, and our foremost responsibility as leaders is to ensure that everyone, with no exceptions, feels that they can succeed and thrive in our community. We want our students to have the best educational experience possible.. . It is for this reason that we have remained adamant that all work that can be done remotely should continue to be done remotely. We have made repeated efforts to ensure that the faculty and GSIs were treated similarly and equitably in fulfilling the needs of our curriculum so that all requests could be accommodated. Given this, about three-quarters of the GSIs teaching this term are doing so remotely.. . The result is that only 22 percent of our undergraduate credit hours are being delivered with some in-person component, based on decisions made as locally as possible by schools, colleges and departments based on pedagogic needs and instructor preferences. By providing more flexibility for students who choose to take classes fully remotely, we reduced density in our residence halls by a third. In addition, we gradually and successfully ramped up our research operations, while keeping the density in our labs low. As measured by network logons, activity on campus is only about 40 percent the level that it was last year at this time.. . Representatives from the university and the Graduate Employees' Organization worked diligently to reach resolution over the Labor Day weekend and through the first two days of the strike. GEO leadership supported a comprehensive university proposal to meet the interests of GEO and end the strike, but it was rejected by a membership vote late Wednesday night. A detailed summary of the university's proposal is available [here](https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/updates-regarding-the-geo-discussions/).. . GEO has raised a number of important issues, and many members of the community have asked for additional information about the matters under discussion. The university's proposal addressed nearly all of the issues GEO raised under the contract. For example:. . * GEO and Academic Human Resources teams worked together to enable a mechanism for GSIs and GSSAs to address very quickly any health and safety concerns in their classrooms related to COVID-19. . . * The proposal also clarified the availability of supplies, such as face coverings and hand sanitizer. . . * The university agreed to provide additional details on testing through the Campus Maize & Blueprint website. . . * The university also provided clarification and guidance on mask enforcement in the classroom, including clarifying the right of all instructional faculty, including GSIs, to cancel class in the event a student refuses to wear a mask after being asked. . . * We affirmed that the U-M International Center would enhance its outreach to graduate students. . . * For parents, the university agreed to provide temporary enhancements for this academic year to the student child care subsidy through the Office of Financial Aid, including offering additional funds for unlicensed child care in the subsidy to all students.. . The university is ready to continue discussions with GEO so that all students are able to continue their studies without further interruption. It is certainly our preference to resolve concerns with productive discussions rather than outside appeals. . . The university's Division of Student Life continues to engage with resident assistants to resolve the concerns they have expressed. Student Life leadership has been in continual contact with RAs and a summary of the division's work to address the latest concerns is [available here](https://studentlife.umich.edu/communication-resstaff). . . We're also addressing concerns about the quarantine and isolation housing we're providing to students. Our commitment to providing meal delivery is continuing, and Student Life staff check in with each student daily. From now on in response to feedback, we will be providing microwaves, and all Michigan Dining meals will come in microwavable packaging.. . One of the major issues raised by GEO and many others in our community is policing. We would like to be extremely clear that we, too, are passionate about the need for police reform across our country. The egregious acts we have all seen in the past months shine a spotlight on structural racism. . . Both of us, along with Division of Public Safety and Security (DPSS) Executive Director Eddie Washington, are committed to immediately addressing any areas of concern that arise in our community. This is a part of our ongoing efforts to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion across campus. Engaging with faculty, students and other community members, the University of Michigan should be a leader in finding ways to address policing problems more broadly. . . Policing concerns are not readily resolved through union negotiations. Instead of a unilateral strategy - such as defunding the police - or addressing these critical issues through a bargaining contract that applies only to one group of employees, we endorse thoughtful engagement with the broader university community to surface both problems and opportunities. For instance, when community members raised concerns about armed police in the Michigan Ambassador program, the university changed the composition of the teams so armed officers were not part of the patrols. A goal of the program has always been to enhance health and safety without requiring calls to law enforcement.. . Recently, our public health experts met individually with members of GEO to address their concerns, and we plan to have similar avenues for faculty and staff to hear directly from these individuals. This is just one example of how we are working to improve our dialogue with you. . . It is clear this is just the beginning of the work yet to be done to rebuild trust and confidence in this community. We welcome suggestions on other mechanisms for hearing from our community, and suggestions on how we can increase transparency in decision-making. Our commitment to you is to engage and to listen.. . We know that you share our deep commitment to this great university - from the health and safety of each of you, to our shared values of transparency and to the research, teaching, learning, service and patient care that are the reasons we all chose U-M. . . Let us work together to address our differences, even those that are strongly held, and to leverage our passions and our shared values.. . Sincerely,. . Mark S. Schlissel . President . . . Susan M.

t3_ir5thk,2020-09-12 04:06:45,Letter to the GSI's From A Stressed Undergrad,"I am a distressed, unsettled first-year that was expecting to get the most of my limited education during these unprecedented times. During my time, I have been trying to gain the most out of educational experience that COVID-19 has presented. . . Recently, I willingly went to into isolation. The process was smooth. I notified UHS around 12 PM that I was experiencing a *minor* sore throat. I talked to MANY people during this time. Campus therapist contacted me, housing contacted me, and even my RA. Around 4 PM I was called by UHS to be evaluated and was sent to receive a COVID test less than 10 minutes later at the Power Center. Around 6 PM DPSS came knocking on my dorm door and escorted me - while carrying my supplies for a possible 10 day isolation - to the quarantine dorms on Northwood III where I isolated while I awaited results. Luckily, I received my results the next morning and was found negative. During this time, I was contacted by the dean, Anne Curzan, by a no caller ID number who wanted to thank me for willingly going into isolation and protecting campus safety. . After the fact, my mother talked directly to Dr. Ernst and the Dean about the experience. They were both very pleasant and willing to listen to the feedback she had to offer. (She only talked to them because she had to supply small things, such as foil to heat my food, so that I would be able to possibly continue isolation. I also feel like I should add that not I have not heard of a single person that has been ill other than myself and I have talked to lots) . . By no means am I saying the way the university has gone about COVID precautions is correct. I spent my first days shoulder to shoulder packed into lines waiting to get into dining halls. But they did fix it . As of now, I rarely am even in close proximity to another student in a dining hall. Yet today, the GSI strike was influencing the dining workers to slow down their process to increase the lengths of the lines and introduce more chance for covid to spread amongst the campus community. . I witnessed the GSI march today as they walked passed, but during the incident, rarely did I see any students, or faculty for that matter social distancing. . . On Tuesday afternoon I was walking to my In Person calculus class where I had to walk through a picket line. I gave these protestors a thumbs up - obviously they can't hear what I'm saying - and walked through to get to my class. As I was about to enter the building a protestor stuck his hand over the swipe pad to open the door. How is this justifiable? How can these GSI's who feel they are being exploited in their work prevent me from the education I deserve. I am first generation college student, who as far as both sides of my family knows, to ever have been given the ability to receive a college education. I am entirely on my own in this already extremely expensive education. . During COVID quarantine, through March until the two weeks before I came to campus, I worked an average of 45 hours a week in a restaurant. Not a single pay check was I given hazard pay or even a bonus for staying with the company despite most employee's leaving for the unemployment benefits. It was extremely upsetting to see my peers ,who barely worked a day in their life, receive $900 a week on unemployment where I - not even wearing mask because it wasn't enforced at the time - made less than $500 weekly. I dealt with customers who were far more rude than they have had been in my time working before COVID. . Not once have I heard of a protection against the undergraduate students during COVID. . . I have read the GEO demands, and have seen how graduate students are demanding an extra year added to their degree. This is understandable. But how can the GSI's March for this when they're jeopardizing my own undergraduate education. Most all of my peers have had cancelled classes for most of the week. We're not in high school. A week of cancelled classes is significant in a college setting. Especially online, and I know everyone in a college setting understands this. And I'm only first year and I already realize that. I may be missing important things about this situation, but this is how *I* and many of my peers feel. . . I have seen the demands about police reform, and I don't disagree, but this is not what I'm trying to talk about at all. . By no means am I saying I do not support the GSI strike, I get where you're coming from. The university should be much more transparent in the process. They should not have let undergrads onto the campus without a much more thorough plan. But it is what it is. This is an unprefented time and we can't remain in closure forever. Someone is going to have to take the first step to normality. I only get one chance and who knows where I'll be next semester if I'm expecting to take Calc II where I barely had a chance to learn Calc I? . I'm not trying to start conflict, I just feel like our side of the situation has been muted and it's terrifying. My friends are scared. We're worried about what's coming next.

I know there has been a fair amount of controversy over GEO's demands concerning defunding the police, so I'll focus my post on the university's problematic COVID-19 plan. . . From how I see it, those complaining have perfectly legitimate concerns about losing out on their education, especially after paying tens of thousands in tuition fees. Yet here's the thing: none of that will matter if/when there's a huge outbreak on campus. At that point, the disruption will be far greater than a GEO/RA strike, and your health will be at risk as well. . . Our university is barely testing at all, and has made no effort to punish students flouting social distancing rules. It's only a matter of time before spread within the community reaches an uncontrollable point. What makes this worse is that relevant concerns have been brought to the admins by GEO, the RAs and other parties again and again. All the university did in these cases was pay lip service to the demands laid out. . . We are in the middle of a pandemic right now. If Michigan is going to bring back 40,000 plus students to campus, then they should be testing us all twice a week at the very minimum. They should be well prepared to accommodate students in quarantine housing, and have social distancing rules well enforced on and off campus. Keep in mind that even with these measures, there's no guarantee that major outbreaks would be avoided. We're not even doing that. . . In the face of inevitable disaster and an administration that is completely delusional (no testing = no cases!), GEO has bravely gone on strike. Not because they're entitled academics, but because they have exhausted every other avenue of raising these concerns. Schlissel, Ernst, and the rest of the admins are negligent in their handling of this in-person semester. Given the high stakes, I believe it is perfectly understandable for the grad students to strike. How else will they get the higher-ups to understand the gravity of their mistakes?. . Lastly, please remember that the virus situation is ""all good"" until it isn't. I am sick and tired of seeing comments about how great we're doing because of our low case count. It takes time for the virus to secure a foothold in a community. In the absence of proper measures to mitigate spread, it's only a matter of time before positive cases accelerate to the point where campus will need to be shut down. . .

UM has 140 players on its [2020 roster](https://mgoblue.com/sports/football/roster), who will need 1,000 tests per week (not counting coaches/trainers/staff).

This is [INCLUDING tests performed with the athletic department:](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/dashboard/about-the-data/). . >UHS reports information on testing that they perform when evaluating symptomatic patients or close-contact exposures and any testing performed in collaboration with Athletics. . . Mark Schlissel has said the university can test up to 3,500 students per week, though he has yet to deliver on this promise. It is unclear what they are waiting for. If we assume those 3,500 weekly tests (which we still have not reached) are NOT coming from student athletes and are instead the general population of students, we will probably have about 5,000 weekly tests total, from which about 25% will be from the football program, which is approximately 0.375% of students. . . NOW. The tests allocated for athletics may different. They are antigen tests. Antigen tests are faster and cheaper than PCR tests, and I'm not sure which UM is/has been using - maybe all our primary testing has been antigen and I'm just not up to speed in which case you can ignore this whole paragraph. Antigen tests are also less accurate than the PCR tests, and more prone to false negatives (negative result when you are in fact infected). [FDA Source](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics). . . HOWEVER. If these tests are good enough for UM Athletics (who frankly are probably far more demanding on their lungs than the rest of us), WHY are they not good enough for students? WHY is the university telling us increased testing cannot be done, while giving 25% of our testing capacity to 0.4% of the student body? The obvious answer is money, but if Schlissel can add 1,000 weekly tests for football, clearly he can find some capacity for the rest of campus.. . GEO, MDining, and MHousing have been demanding more testing for weeks. Faculty Senate is preparing a vote of no confidence in Schlissel's reopening plan, and he has refused to budge in increasing testing capacity for students and faculty. He tells us it's logistically difficult, or that students will be less safe if testing is increasing. Meanwhile, he votes to at least triple the amount of testing being done for athletics while telling everyone else on campus demanding more tests that there's nothing he can do.

Edit to add:. . Don't get me wrong. Any other year, I'm 100% into Michigan Football. Never missed a home game, and never left early in my four years here. But I cannot support the decision to give them an excess of resources that are desperately needed by the rest of the University to continue the academic mission. . .

Edit to add:. . Don't get me wrong. Any other year, I'm 100% into Michigan Football. Never missed a home game, and never left early in my four years here. But I cannot support the decision to give them an excess of resources that are desperately needed by the rest of the University to continue the academic mission. . . The NCAA loves to emphasize that student athletes are students first and athletes second. It's unfortunate that the University has made clear that ""athlete"" comes before everything else.",error,0.0

t3_iuiuak,2020-09-17 12:53:07,A Guide to Researching the University of Michigan,"TL;DR - I put together a resource guide for how to do research about the university. U-M is a public institution, if there is something you want to know, the data and history is out there! . . I haven't done a Throwback Thursday post in a while because my own life has been pretty chaotic lately and, well, the subreddit isn't exactly lacking for content. A few weeks ago someone asked me how I did research for those posts and [I did a short writeup about where I go for photos and news sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/i8zquv/throwback_thursday_gay_students_march_in_favor_of/g1fn0eh/). . [This post earlier in the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/itb3us/can_someone_explain_this_to_me/) really frustrated me and made me want to put together a more comprehensive guide to how to research things about the university. [The tweet it references](https://mobile.twitter.com/hixonbecky/status/1305890681555226626) has a pretty clear point to make (U-M values policing more than graduate students) and seems to provide strong supporting evidence. I agree that in general if you want to know how an organization values something, follow the money. But if you take just a moment to look beyond the surface you see that those numbers are not the entire story. In that thread I gave some more context to other money invested by Rackham that isn't shown in what is basically a sum of staff annual salaries. [In a separate thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/itdbwl/but_why_do_they_want_to_defund_dpss/g5dydzx/), after doing about 2 minutes of research (it's quick if you know where to look!) I was able to find some other data that I think provided much stronger support for the point the original tweet was trying to make.. . **Finances**. . It's no surprise that the finances and budgeting for a university are complicated. The university has many resources to clarify where university funds come from and how they are spent. The [Office of Budget and Planning](https://obp.umich.edu/) is always a good place to start. Beyond that there are many places you can find more information about the specific dollar amounts going to different initiatives. . . * [Funding Snapshot](https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/key-issues/tuition/general-fund-budget-tutorial/#:~:text=General%20Fund%20money%20come%20from,no%20taxpayer%20or%20tuition%20support) - This is a short tutorial that explains where U-M's money comes from and how it is spent. Learn about the difference between general, designated, auxiliary, and restricted funds.. . * [University Budget - Summary Books](https://obp.umich.edu/budget/budget-book/) - A complete accounting of university budgeted general fund revenues and expenditures for each fiscal year. Includes all three campuses. The 'Summary' books show big picture funding allocations, such as the fact that LSA had a general fund budget of $448,200,491 in the 2019-20 fiscal year . . * [University Budget - Detail Books](https://obp.umich.edu/budget/budget-book/) - The 'Detail' books offer department/program level budgetary information. Again, this is just money coming from the general fund, so it does not include funds from donors, research grants, etc. This book can tell us how LSA specifically allocates money. For example, The Chemistry Department received $11.5 million for salary/benefits and $5.1 million for financial aid. . . * [Salary Reports & Staff Demographics](https://hr.umich.edu/working-u-m/management-administration/hr-reports-data-services/hr-data-requests-standard-reports) - Many of you might already know about this resource, it is fodder for news articles when published each year. You can view a complete listing of U-M regular faculty & staff (does not include graduate students or temporary employees). . . * [UMSalary.info](https://umsalary.info/) - A third party site that has aggregated salary data 2002 to the present and made it into a searchable database (by person, department, or job title). This is how I can quickly find out the [Chemistry Department has 158 employees](https://umsalary.info/deptsearch.php?Dept=LSA%20Chemistry&Year=0&page=1) (though note that not all draw salary from the $11.5 million they get from the general fund).. . * Endowment & Investments - A few months ago [The Michigan Daily published a helpful article](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/news/12-billion-dollars-%E2%80%A6-what-understanding-university%E2%80%99s-endowment) on understanding what the university's endowment is and how it can/cannot be spent. [U-M Public Affairs also publishes annual profiles](https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/key-issues/university-of-michigan-endowment/) of the endowment and has a FAQ on their website with more information.

It contained the full set of admissions and academic requirements for each program at Michigan, tuition & fees information, records of degrees granted, and much much more. If you want really granular information, this is the place to go.

I have used this once and really don't imagine it would come in handy to most folks.",127,"A Guide to Researching the University of Michigan. TL;DR - I put together a resource guide for how to do research about the university. U-M is a public institution, if there is something you want to know, the data and history is out there! . . I haven't done a Throwback Thursday post in a while because my own life has been pretty chaotic lately and, well, the subreddit isn't exactly lacking for content. A few weeks ago someone asked me how I did research for those posts and [I did a short writeup about where I go for photos and news sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/i8zquv/throwback_thursday_gay_students_march_in_favor_of/g1fn0eh/). . [This post earlier in the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/itb3us/can_someone_explain_this_to_me/) really frustrated me and made me want to put together a more comprehensive guide to how to research things about the university. [The tweet it references](https://mobile.twitter.com/hixonbecky/status/1305890681555226626) has a pretty clear point to make (U-M values policing more than graduate students) and seems to provide strong supporting evidence. I agree that in general if you want to know how an organization values something, follow the money. But if you take just a moment to look beyond the surface you see that those numbers are not the entire story. In that thread I gave some more context to other money invested by Rackham that isn't shown in what is basically a sum of staff annual salaries. [In a separate thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/itdbwl/but_why_do_they_want_to_defund_dpss/g5dydzx/), after doing about 2 minutes of research (it's quick if you know where to look!) I was able to find some other data that I think provided much stronger support for the point the original tweet was trying to make.. . **Finances**. . It's no surprise that the finances and budgeting for a university are complicated. The university has many resources to clarify where university funds come from and how they are spent. The [Office of Budget and Planning](https://obp.umich.edu/) is always a good place to start. Beyond that there are many places you can find more information about the specific dollar amounts going to different initiatives. . . * [Funding Snapshot](https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/key-issues/tuition/general-fund-budget-tutorial/#:~:text=General%20Fund%20money%20come%20from,no%20taxpayer%20or%20tuition%20support) - This is a short tutorial that explains where U-M's money comes from and how it is spent. Learn about the difference between general, designated, auxiliary, and restricted funds.. . * [University Budget - Summary Books](https://obp.umich.edu/budget/budget-book/) - A complete accounting of university budgeted general fund revenues and expenditures for each fiscal year. Includes all three campuses. The 'Summary' books show big picture funding allocations, such as the fact that LSA had a general fund budget of $448,200,491 in the 2019-20 fiscal year . . * [University Budget - Detail Books](https://obp.umich.edu/budget/budget-book/) - The 'Detail' books offer department/program level budgetary information. Again, this is just money coming from the general fund, so it does not include funds from donors, research grants, etc. This book can tell us how LSA specifically allocates money. For example, The Chemistry Department received $11.5 million for salary/benefits and $5.1 million for financial aid. . . * [Salary Reports & Staff Demographics](https://hr.umich.edu/working-u-m/management-administration/hr-reports-data-services/hr-data-requests-standard-reports) - Many of you might already know about this resource, it is fodder for news articles when published each year. You can view a complete listing of U-M regular faculty & staff (does not include graduate students or temporary employees). . . * [UMSalary.info](https://umsalary.info/) - A third party site that has aggregated salary data 2002 to the present and made it into a searchable database (by person, department, or job title). This is how I can quickly find out the [Chemistry Department has 158 employees](https://umsalary.info/deptsearch.php?Dept=LSA%20Chemistry&Year=0&page=1) (though note that not all draw salary from the $11.5 million they get from the general fund).. . * Endowment & Investments - A few months ago [The Michigan Daily published a helpful article](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/news/12-billion-dollars-%E2%80%A6-what-understanding-university%E2%80%99s-endowment) on understanding what the university's endowment is and how it can/cannot be spent. [U-M Public Affairs also publishes annual profiles](https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/key-issues/university-of-michigan-endowment/) of the endowment and has a FAQ on their website with more information.

This may be a long shot, but I wanted to see if anyone remembers seeing my dad attending any games at the Big House as Chewie. He was a HUGE fan, and just passed away last month. (We're only semi-joking when we tell people it's because of Big 10 games being canceled.). . He went to a lot of games, but I know that he dressed up as Chewbacca the Wookiee for the game closest to Halloween each year. I've heard that he went in the costume wearing a U of M shirt or jersey with rips in it, and has been going for at least a decade. I've heard that he would constantly get stopped by fans at tailgates or in the arena on the way to his seat to pose for photos, and would end up being late but loved the reactions anyway. He also got to lead the marching band one year, but I don't know when it was and unfortunately can't find any coverage on it.. . If on the off chance you remember seeing him or have any photos of him, would you mind sharing your story with me? It's been really tough for us, and seeing the news of football returning is very bittersweet to me. I know it's a long shot, but I'm not sure where else to reach out, and I'm hoping he made an impact on somebody in here.. . I'm not sure if it would be possible, but I'm also hoping we can find out a way to reach out and maybe get a small memorial spot in a game for him. . .

I am wondering how feasible this combination would be, as I have not seen any discussions regarding this combination specifically. Further, what is the projected time that one would finish a dual degree like this? Based on my transfer credits (discussed below), would I be able to complete both degrees in 4-4.5 years?. . My primary reason for pursuing this is because after graduating high school, I will likely have over the 30 credit transfer limit for Ross. Assuming I maximize my AP exam potential, I'll have 44 credits from there. Further, I will be taking at least 6 semester college courses at my local CC, some of which directly transfer to required classes at Ross. I haven't calculated the credit hours on those courses. . As a side question, for those CC courses that transfer directly to a class at Mich, do those count toward the 120/150 degree credit requirement or do they only fulfill the class (the latter meaning I would still need to take more classes for credits).. . One thing that I cannot find is the transfer credit policy for dual degree (Ross & LSA) students. It seems like a standalone LSA degree has a transfer limit of 60 (?) credits, but does anyone know the specifics on that for my situation?. .

Important to add that I of course am not calling out everyone who goes to this school, and I've mostly managed to escape the groups that do this type of shit. But they exist here, and are in very prevalent numbers and make up large social circles on this campus. I sort of attempted to say this a while ago, someone showed up and just derailed the whole thing because they needed to make themselves look good by making this all about them and their perception of my actions. Please don't make this about me. I am sharing my perspective, but I am trying to speak for the larger non-upper class and racial minority groups who have to deal with so much discomfort, feelings of displacement and inadequacy. Everyone feels that here, but we feel it especially, because we know coming in or we quickly become aware, of our disadvantaged position due to coming from such different environments than the literal majority of students attending the university.. . I'm Hispanic and if I say something that goes against many people here's little theory of how I should think / feel about situations, I will get shameeedd like there's no tomorrow. They act like they know what the hell it's like to go to schools in underfunded areas and have a shittier foundation because of it. They act like they are ""educated"" on the black experience or can tell people how to think about it just because they support BLM and know a thing or two about the platform.. . . . Then they are confused why things are harder for the more disadvantaged people academically It sucks to see these upper class kids procrastinate like crazy and still succeed in many cases (not all). They are deliberate perfectionists. This is an issue in multiple departments, literally from EECS to Psychology. And when I joke about it telling them they don't need to be, , I've had two people respond to me by going ""Yeah, cause if I wasn't, I'd be afraid of failing classes like you, no offense."". . They call me privileged because I think that discourse is a better way to solve discrimination rather than just yelling at people to stop hating certain people or outcasting them completely. While they enjoy the benefits of being say, LGBT and not nearly as hated as people would be in other parts of the world, because people before them engaged in discourse to educate others with power in this country.. . All of this and more just, makes me hate this school, hate that I'm here when I constantly deal with people like this (at least during my first year). Overall I'm still grateful, the school will open many doors and gave me the best FinAid deal possible that isn't GoBlue. But this school has a shit ton of bubble bursting to do. Sorry rant over.. . . . EDIT: For an explanation / context, sorta long sorry. . A lot of these points are from my experience as a member of the university of Michigan's Discord server in the serious topics channel from some time ago. I quit before fall semester. When social issues come up, I offer my opinion like ""I grew up outcasted by people, and I feel like, even as a non white person in LGBT, these movements for these groups tend to outcast people more than get them on the same page."" The people I was talking to persistently argued that that was the point of these movements, to force people into line because that's totally what we need. People don't agree with the ideas, and rather than speak to them, we need to put them in line. Like that is going to help minority groups. Me saying I got shamed was probably too strong a word, but that's what I meant. When I try to state my own opinions I get drowned out and ""educated"" because they don't correlate to what these people think the one right answer is in that group. And because they did not experience growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods and just rely on this theoretical idea of who black / hispanic / poor students are and what they need, it doesn't hit them that these are people who end up struggling the most statistically. We have CSP which is extremely helpful for those who need it, although somewhat limited space in those classes However, the bigger point is that these people who claim to care not only at times shut down discourse, they also don't advocate as much for looking out for these people struggling. I don't know about others in these minority groups but I felt incredibly alienated in my first year. Like the 60 percent of the student body that was upper class lived in a totally different world, Unable to actually hear out and understand what other people have to go through.

I'm in my third year here, so I'm able to reflect somewhat on my experience here as well as share what it's like currently, pandemic and all.. . I come from a town in metro-Detroit where financial stress, domestic abuse, and mental illness was the only reality. 2 classmates killed themselves in high school, and at least 4 of my close friends were hospitalized for trying to do the same. People regularly ran away from home and the class I started with my freshman year dropped by 500 by the time we graduated, due to dropping out, being held back, etc.. . And yet about 5 of my graduating class made it here, to UM, so it couldn't have been all bad right? Well of the ones I stayed in contact with, one dropped out freshman year and the other, much like myself, struggles with motivation and grades and what have you.. . Anyway. Coming here, to UM, felt somewhat akin to culture shock. Everyday felt like a new realization. I soon learned that people would look at you like you needed a straight jacket when you'd crack jokes about offing yourself or pity you because you didn't really ever get accustomed to eating three meals a day. (Seriously, I mean, I've had people accuse me of eating disorders and the like, but I just didn't grow up eating three meals a day. A cosmic brownie on the way to the bus stop, maybe; poke around at the inedible school lunch; a measly dinner at home - - that was the norm.) People would get so excited to go home and see their friends and families over break while I sat back, scared to greet mine and whatever bullshit they wanted to spew that time (xenophobia, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia? verbal abuse? throwing and breaking shit? forcing me to eat low-budget meals that physically make me sick due to my IBS and GERD?) Hell, it took me over a year, and being abroad a month, to finally realize that the bruises my SO left all over my body were not okay, regardless of the concern my roommates expressed over them for months.. . And then it took me another year, to come to terms with how weak that made me feel, that it was okay to not be okay, etc etc etc.. . I just feel so isolated from everyone else here at UM, who focus on fitness or being vegan or going to parties or even grades and classes. I can barely manage to get out of bed every day and the few friends / acquaintances I had made got lost along the way, especially with Covid last year and now. I feel like I've entirely wasted my life at UM, not partaking in any extracurriculars or social life due to everything stated here and more, and that I'll never get the chance now. . . By the time I was ready to go to games and parties and try to make friends and do all the ""normal things"" , I couldn't. Sure, there would've always been the divide based on experience, but I feel like I at least know now how to approach other people here and have normal conversations (I would also like to add here that I suffer from social anxiety disorder and likely adhd and/or autism, too, though any diagnosis won't be possible until I can save enough money to see another doctor. The majority of the ones at UM aren't very welcoming or understanding in my experience) . . I also realize that not all of this is directly correlated with being first gen or from a lower class, but a lot of these are comorbid and this is my experience. I guess I'm just looking to vent or commiserate, but any advice or insight is also welcome. Thanks for listening.",178,"Experience of a First Gen, Lower Class Student. Hi.

Hell, it took me over a year, and being abroad a month, to finally realize that the bruises my SO left all over my body were not okay, regardless of the concern my roommates expressed over them for months.. . And then it took me another year, to come to terms with how weak that made me feel, that it was okay to not be okay, etc etc etc.. . I just feel so isolated from everyone else here at UM, who focus on fitness or being vegan or going to parties or even grades and classes. I can barely manage to get out of bed every day and the few friends / acquaintances I had made got lost along the way, especially with Covid last year and now. I feel like I've entirely wasted my life at UM, not partaking in any extracurriculars or social life due to everything stated here and more, and that I'll never get the chance now. . . By the time I was ready to go to games and parties and try to make friends and do all the ""normal things"" , I couldn't. Sure, there would've always been the divide based on experience, but I feel like I at least know now how to approach other people here and have normal conversations (I would also like to add here that I suffer from social anxiety disorder and likely adhd and/or autism, too, though any diagnosis won't be possible until I can save enough money to see another doctor. The majority of the ones at UM aren't very welcoming or understanding in my experience) . . I also realize that not all of this is directly correlated with being first gen or from a lower class, but a lot of these are comorbid and this is my experience. I guess I'm just looking to vent or commiserate, but any advice or insight is also welcome. Thanks for listening.",error,0.0

But is that really what we should be doing? I mean EECS as a whole has problems too, but 281 is so systematically bad it's almost comical.. . Here are some things I've noticed:. . 1. Obligatory long office hours queues. I've never actually gone, but that's specifically because the queues are so damn long. This was made worse by online learning- I really shouldn't be interrupting my workflow to check Google Meet every couple minutes.. 2. Stringent requirements. We get two late days across all projects and labs. This is not normal. I took EECS 370 this semester as well (I know) and they gave us three late days across their extremely short projects. They were also more lenient with deadlines- both project 3's were originally due on the same day, but 370's project 3 deadline was pushed back farther than 281's.. 3. Staff incompetence. All of this I might have been able to forgive had the staff adopted the same level of accountability that they expected from the students. Unfortunately, this is not the case. I noticed mistakes in lecture and grading over elementary (EECS 280) concepts. I won't name them because they could be used to track me down, but they were extremely obvious and it still took me a long time to get them fixed. Moreover, their rubrics for the written exam problems are unreasonable and poorly written (a staff member actually told me this re: one of the written questions, and I have to say I agree). Actually, most of their errors are within (lenient) reason, especially for student staff (although I maintain that the EECS department needs more a stringent hiring process for IAs), but contrasted with the insane level of precision, dedication, and privilege you need to do well in the class, are completely unreasonable.. 4. Normalization of mental illness. I really sound like I'm beating a dead horse here, but this is not normal. Why is it that most EECS students want to die all the time?. 5.

Lastly, I'm really not a fan of the attitude EECS (280 specifically) has towards cheaters. There are many reasons a student might cheat. Mental illnesses that are caused by the classes themselves, financial reasons like scholarships, and personal safety.

I'm a sophomore in DS-Eng, but I'm currently on a leave from college under mandatory enlistment duty from my home country.

I enjoyed the classes I took so far, and am looking forward to upper level CS/Stats classes. My rationale in choosing DS over CS was because I wasn't (and still am not) entirely sure what kind of career path I'd like to take, and I thought a DS degree would offer me a little bit more flexibility over the CS one. My current plan is to work for a few years after I graduate and attend grad school, but I'm not entirely sure yet. . .

As we have seen over the past ten months, one of the difficult challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the uncertainty that we have been forced to endure. We do not always know what measures will be needed to protect health and safety, here on campus and beyond, and that has made planning for major events such as commencement a much more ambiguous endeavor.. . To help us plan, we surveyed and engaged in conversations with you, our graduating students. We learned that if we can't be in person for graduation, you want a virtual ceremony with synchronous content that allows the class to gather together at the same moment and includes many of the traditional elements of a University of Michigan commencement. You also asked that we announce the format as early as we can to provide as much time as possible for you and your families to plan.. . In response to your great feedback and the ongoing public health challenges of the pandemic, U-M will hold a virtual commencement ceremony on Saturday, May 1 at noon.. . We very much wish that we could hold a safe commencement in Michigan Stadium, along with the many other celebration activities that are a fundamental part of our community life and traditions. Commencement is the most joyous event of the academic year for many in our community, as we celebrate the accomplishments of our graduates and draw inspiration from the achievements they will share with our world.. . The May 1 ceremony will include synchronous content and will be available for viewing later for those who can't be there during the scheduled time. The most important element of a commencement, according to the survey responses from 4,500 graduating students, was to have a ceremony that included the conferring of your U-M degrees. Our commencement will feature that important rite of passage prominently. We're also working to provide virtual performances, host interactive elements, and bring in an inspiring main speaker.. . As more information is finalized, we'll post it to our main [commencement](http://commencement.umich.edu/) site. Our plan for virtual ceremonies also applies to the Rackham Graduate Exercises and the different types of graduation events held by organizations, student groups and most of our Ann Arbor schools and colleges.. . In addition, we are pleased to invite all graduates who missed out on an in-person ceremony due to COVID-19 to attend and participate in any future main commencement of their choosing. They and their families will be our honored guests at these ceremonies, and the graduates will be recognized not just for the completion of their degrees, but also for their resilience and fortitude in persevering during these challenging times. We're also continuing to consider options for inviting graduates from this year's class and the Class of 2020 back to campus for special future in-person celebrations.. . We still do not know what public health measures will need to be in place in May to hold events like commencement. Currently, we remain under prudent restrictions on gathering sizes, and it's impossible to predict factors such as infection and vaccination rates, travel guidelines and when state and local limits on gatherings may change.

Many different scenarios for a ceremony were considered, along with the feedback our students expressed in our [commencement survey](https://commencement.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Report-on-2021-Commencement-survey.pdf), conversations we've had with students over the last few months, and consultations with campus public health experts.. . Thank you for your patience and understanding. We join you in the hope for better days ahead, as we celebrate the University of Michigan Class of 2021.. . Sincerely,. . Mark S. Schlissel .

Students are welcome to get in touch as well! You WILL be paid . Art is a talent that deserves to be paid its worth. . . I figured I'd check if there are any cinema/art students or hobby adults who dabble who'd like to shoot for us! We can obviously right a contract to protect your rights as a contractor - PS it's they'd be Indian events- so lots of color, dancing etc. . . . .

t3_lmcym3,2021-02-18 03:48:35,I got rejected from UM PhD program and I was admitted to psych ward,"Hi all, I finally have the courage to post this. I'm a current UM student. I absolutely love UM and I wanted to continue my PhD study here. The professor who I wanted to work with wrote a strong recommendation letter for me, which made me feel it was promising to get in. But the program rejected me anyway.. . Several hours after I received the rejection decision I had an appointment with my primary care physician. I was hurting so much that I couldn't stop crying in front of him. ""I've tried my best, but in the end everything just doesn't matter"" - that's the only thought on my mind at that moment. He asked me if I was going to hurt myself. I said yes, without knowing the consequences of admitting that I felt suicidal. He sent me to the UM Hospital Psychiatric Emergency Service. I was interviewed by several staff. They decided to transfer me to a mental health unit of another hospital, aka. the psych ward. They kept me waiting in a chair from 6PM to 8AM the next day because no beds were available. I was transferred by an ambulance to the psych ward. Everyone there was seeing me as a breaking news. ""Wow we got a UM student here!"" ""Why would UM student be committed to the psych ward?"" ""UM students should be smart enough to navigate life crisis."" While I surely didn't feel I belonged there, I felt I had nowhere to go.. . During the whole week while I was hospitalized, the staff took away all my personal belongings, including my phone and laptop. In other words, they cut off all my contact with the outside world. I could not text my friends, check my emails, or work on anything. I was begging for some books to read, but they didn't provide any. All they asked me to do was laying in my bed. So I lay in the bed crying for the whole week, missing my friends and missing myself - the self who dreamed to be a researcher. You might be thinking the psychiatrist should be able to help me.

Hi all, I finally have the courage to post this. I'm a current UM student. I absolutely love UM and I wanted to continue my PhD study here. The professor who I wanted to work with wrote a strong recommendation letter for me, which made me feel it was promising to get in. But the program rejected me anyway.. . Several hours after I received the rejection decision I had an appointment with my primary care physician. I was hurting so much that I couldn't stop crying in front of him. ""I've tried my best, but in the end everything just doesn't matter"" - that's the only thought on my mind at that moment. He asked me if I was going to hurt myself. I said yes, without knowing the consequences of admitting that I felt suicidal. He sent me to the UM Hospital Psychiatric Emergency Service. I was interviewed by several staff. They decided to transfer me to a mental health unit of another hospital, aka. the psych ward. They kept me waiting in a chair from 6PM to 8AM the next day because no beds were available. I was transferred by an ambulance to the psych ward. Everyone there was seeing me as a breaking news. ""Wow we got a UM student here!"" ""Why would UM student be committed to the psych ward?"" ""UM students should be smart enough to navigate life crisis."" While I surely didn't feel I belonged there, I felt I had nowhere to go.. . During the whole week while I was hospitalized, the staff took away all my personal belongings, including my phone and laptop. In other words, they cut off all my contact with the outside world. I could not text my friends, check my emails, or work on anything. I was begging for some books to read, but they didn't provide any. All they asked me to do was laying in my bed. So I lay in the bed crying for the whole week, missing my friends and missing myself - the self who dreamed to be a researcher. You might be thinking the psychiatrist should be able to help me.

You can find the post here: https://reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/lmcym3/i_got_rejected_from_um_phd_program_and_i_was/ and some more advice here: https://reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/lmcym3/_/gnuutb4/?context=1. . I realised that a lot of people might not be aware of some nuances of this process and might not know what will/will not get them in trouble. . . Here are some tips I have after having personally been through the process. Feel free to correct me if any of this is outdated (my experience was pre-covid). Feel free to add things I missed too. This is a repost of my comment in that thread. . . Please keep in mind that this is NOT mental health advice, but self preservation advice. Also since I'm an international student, the advice applies more for our fellow internationals. . . 1. before devulging any mental health struggles, please find out what the person could and would do with this information. Some professors/advisors are obligated to report you, some are not. Most therapists/psych professionals will only involve the police/psych ward if they believe you're a danger to yourself or others. In this case, you are allowed to be passively suicidal, as long as you have no access to weapons and do not have a plan and do not intend to make a plan.. 2. If you are NOT ACTIVELY SUICIDAL and decide to call the CAPS number on the back of the M Card because you're really going through something and would like to call someone, please be careful. They will ask you for your address. **You are allowed to not give it.** If they think that you're in danger, they **will** call DPSS on you, and they **will** charge into your room and forcefully drag you to the psych ward. This process is honestly more like an arrest minus the handcuffs than trying to help you. Obviously they can't do this if you 1. don't give them an address or a full name and 2. make it clear that you have no intent to complete suicide. (Honestly I recommend a non-UM helpline). . 3. If unfortunately you do end up in the UM psych ward, here are some things you should know. if you are an international student, your insurance covers all costs. **However**, if your parents are not tolerant of mental health issues, **check your billing address**. The psych ward will send an itemized bill and your parents will definitely know if it gets sent to your house. Also **check your emergency contact**, since they will get called. I recommend setting it as your best friend/SO in Michigan. As OP said, you are not allowed your phone (or any other personal belongings tbh) most of the time, but you can call your friends with a phone they provide. Your friends are allowed to bring you things that have been deemed to not be a risk. . 4. Other random psych ward facts (pre-covid): You're allowed to mingle with other inpatients and you'll probably have a roommate. Your friends are allowed to visit every day for about 6 hours. Nicotine gum/patches are available if you need it. The bed is not too comfortable, I recommend you ask your friend to bring some items that will bring you comfort (stuffed animals for something). They usually only hold you for a week, and in my experience you will need a friend to sign you out to be discharged. . 6. If it is any consolation the UM psych ward also has unlimited snacks, a lounge area, games and a piano. They also do your laundry for you. Not sure if it makes up for the horrible standard of care though. . . It's really sad and bleak and many levels of fucked up that these tips are important, and honestly UM psych ward is one of the cruelest places I have personally seen. The nurses say horrid, unqualified things (told my best friend they are responsible for my life) and they treat you so dismissively and almost with contempt. . . However, on the bright side:. . - if you're international, therapy is 90% covered and anti-depressants are 99.9% covered.. - a lot of professors are very compassionate.

After seeing this post after I left, I have been meaning to post about my experience as well but I am still quite shaken about it and only now have the courage to do so. Hopefully talking about it helps.. . I am currently an undergrad in UofM and I have been dealing with depression for quick some time now. I have been trying to get my life back on track and I think it was going well. I have recently been talking to a therapist and they recommended me to talk to my primary care physician about taking anti-depressants and that's how this all started. To be clear, I am not suicidal and at the very worst, serverely depressed with an idealization of suicide. I have never hurt myself or others nor plan to.. . I made an appointment to my PCP that I have been seeing since I was a child which was not a good idea in hindsight. They specialize in family care and were just unprepared for what I was asking of them. When I had told them about my depression, they had me stay in the room as they called the hospital to get me transferred. I had to get escorted by police because they did not trust me to get there on my own. . . Once I arrived, I had to wait to get admitted for about 2 hours because they were so busy. When I actually did get admitted, I had to give them everything and wait for a psychiatrist to come evaluate me. That took another couple hours. When they finally came, they asked me a couple of questions that lasted about 3 minutes. The questions were things like ""How long have you been depressed?"" ""Do you think about killing yourself?"" ""How would you do it?"" I answered truthfully but I really wish I didn't. I had told them 3 years, yes, and I guess I would go into a closed garage with my car running. After this, they left for another couple of hours. I kept on asking what was happening and when I could go. The nurses said I had to keep waiting for the psychiatrist. After many hours they came back and said I had to stay as I was deemed a risk to myself and others. Unfortunately, my insurance didn't cover this hospital so they were trying to transfer me to somewhere else that would. They had no idea how long this would take so I was just forced to wait. It took 3 days. 3 Days of nothing but just laying in a bed while someone watched me, making sure I don't do anything. I felt myself going insane, just trying to make the time go by. I was given only a word search and an xbox with no games (so useless) on the second day and finally a book and a switch with an actual game on the third day but only hours before I left. At this point, my anxiety was sky high and was shaking at the fear of staying any longer. I felt so relieved getting transfered, just hoping I can go back home later that day.. . I was driven to a holding ground of sorts, where they evaluate you before sending you to another hospital. I was really hoping I could convince them I was not a danger and to let me go with what I originally wanted, some medication. I was allowed my stuff back so I was getting in contact with my family and updating them on what was happening and my plans on leaving. After talking to the staff, I figured out why I was not allowed to leave. The psychiatrist that had seen me for 3 minutes had concluded that I was suicidal with the intent to asphyxia myself. They had concluded that I am unwell and can no longer make medical decisions for myself. I was told if the doctor in the new facility did not agree, I could have them override the decision and let me go. I talked to the doctor, told them my situation, and was confident that I would be let go. After some time, I ask the staff what the decision was. It was for me to get hospitalized again. I pleaded to talk to the doctor again and kept asking all the staff what I could do. It was already around 8pm and they had said I was the last to see the doctor for the day. They said it was a close decision but the doctor ultimately listened to the previous doctors recommendation. I kept asking about other options, about my rights, about involuntary stay and so on. I was basically told that I have no rights and there was nothing I could do. I knew for a fact that I had rights but I didn't know what they were. After a while, I was pulled aside by one of the staff and was told to basically stop being difficult and that there was nothing I could do but accept it. At this point, I was so full of anxiety, fear, and rage. I felt like I was just being ignored and that the staff didn't give a single shit about me. They just wanted me to shut up and go with it. I really melt down after this.. . This is when I was finally admitted to a psych ward at 2am. I still hadn't given up and kept asking everyone there what my options are. The nurse there straight up told me that there was really nothing I could do, and the best thing I could do was just go with it as well. They said if I act out, they would keep me there. If I don't take the meds that they prescribe, they would keep me there. If I try to take the legal route, they would keep me there. There was nothing but try to act as normal as possible and be discharged in another 5-7 days. I thought I could maybe go through the legal route but after asking about a ITT (intent to terminate treatment) form, I was immediately threatened by a nurse to sign another involuntary admission form which would force me to stay at least 3 more days. I had given up hope and just wished I could just escape to my friends and family. The doctors there were also no help. When meeting with one, he first talked about another patient in front of me in closed doors to another colleague but I guess I could listen. When he finished, he had asked me if I was korean or chinese or what? I answered chinese american and he proceeded to go off on china, assuming I would be fine with it because I was american. He made comments such as ""Chinese health care is one bullet to the head"" and so on. I could do nothing but agree and nod. This doctor was in control of the meds I was being forced to take or else I would be there forever. For the rest of the days, I was just trying to seem as sane as possible while shaking with anxiety, with the most fear I have ever felt in my life, and with nothing but a wall phone to connect me to the outside world. . . When I was finally discharged, I had just sped through everything, saying I was perfectly fine, that I improved and am all better. In reality, I never felt so much anxiety, I have never felt so much fear, and I have never been so fucked up. They had told me to continue with the medication but I realize after that they never asked for my pharmacy nor gave me a prescription. I was discharged feeling far worse than I ever have before and with no meds that I was trying to get in the first place. It has been a week and I still get anxiety attacks that I have never had before, I keep waking up from nightmares about being kept there forever. I was trying to get better but was left with all this, no meds, and a huge distrust of the health industry. I haven't been able to even look at school work since then and I don't know what to do now.

Close to seven years ago, I had to undergo emergency brain surgery because part of my brain burst, and I could have died from the blood loss. I was stabilized-evidently-but it was found I had an AVM located in my brain. Essentially, AVMs are an extremely rare (one in a million I've been told) malformation that forms into masses of blood vessels where the veins are directly connected to arteries. They have a tendency to burst, and mine did.. . I had to undergo years of physical therapy but, eventually, I recovered a great deal. I even did well enough in my school to get into UofM...somehow. I do, however, have a rather poor record when it comes to mathematics, with my younger brother having surpassed me in it by now. I had to meet with a tutor after the surgery, was granted what is essentially twofold extra time on tests, was allowed to work on it even after school, could gain back half the points by correcting my mistakes, and even with all of that I only was mediocre in my classes. However, I asked that same teacher to write a recommendation for my application, and he immediately accepted my offer and wrote it despite-again-me only being a mediocre student.. . I'm trying to say that I work hard at mathematics, even though I'm not good at it.. . Cut to today. I'm a part of ASTRO 102 and despite meeting with tutors, attending every lecture, and doing my homework early when I can, all I have is a subpar 67%.

After I submitted my most recent project (I did not cheat, or share anything/look up anything) I compared my code to hers. And it was very very similar. I just do not get how the plagiarism detection system that EECS department uses detects cheating. EECS 183 is a intro class with minimal solutions to the test cases. There are not many different ways to write the code from someone else. But I noticed one or more of my functions is almost exactly the same except for a different variable. But she did not show me anything when I was working on it because she knew the consequences of a Honor Code Violation. But now I am scared that I will be violated for doing nothing wrong, except writing my own code that is perhaps similar to hers. Is this just how it is for EECS 183? Are the teachers more lenient on the Honor Code Violation for the first 2 projects. The project literally tells you exactly what to do, there is not much room for creativity. Also, I tried looking up cases of EECs 183 violations and I can not find many. Is this the reason why? I can only find Honor Code violations for EECS 280 and above. Anyways, I saw that I will get -1/3 of a letter grade and a 0 on the assignment. And I heard it is a long process to fight it. What can I do?? I am definitely going to fight it if I get accused because I am innocent, but I do not feel like taking all the time to do so. This is annoying. If whatever, detection system they use actually flags my code, then it must flag 100 others because that makes no sense. Literally....literally for some functions there is a simple way to do it, then there is a complex way. And I am sure many people choose the simple way. And for a intro course like this, there has to be a huge overlap in similar code. Right? I am sorry for ranting, you can downvote this, but I am just upset, because I just compared my code with hers and saw all the similarities. And I am currently am having a freakout and can't go to bed. Also, if my parents ever found out that I got a violation for cheating. I would actually not be alive.

So I made a chrome extension to constantly remember goals for 2021 before I type youtube.com into my browser.. . This is year has been a bit bittersweet for me. Since I realized 2021 is going to be another whole year of Zoom University, everything became unproductive. I was a bit lost in my life.. . My solution was regularly reminding my goals! Every morning, I read my goals out loud for 2021 and spent a few minutes checking the progress. This little practice really helped me a lot. It was a small thing but really made me stay motivated for the whole day.. . As I graduate this summer, I want to finish strong and also meaningful. So my friend and I created this Chrome Extension! Yes, there are tons of extensions for new tab productivity but I wanted something simple and clean. Crazyones Tab features inspiring quotes from great entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates! Plus whenever you open a new tab, you'll be able to see new quotes as well as your goals for 2021. We designed the extension to become a source of motivation + to stay on top of your goals for 2021.. . My friend and I started building this Chrome Extension as a side project and now it became the most meaningful and memorable part of my college experience.

Hey Wolverines!. . I spent too much time watching Youtube this year. So I made a chrome extension to constantly remember goals for 2021 before I type youtube.com into my browser.. . This is year has been a bit bittersweet for me. Since I realized 2021 is going to be another whole year of Zoom University, everything became unproductive. I was a bit lost in my life.. . My solution was regularly reminding my goals! Every morning, I read my goals out loud for 2021 and spent a few minutes checking the progress. This little practice really helped me a lot. It was a small thing but really made me stay motivated for the whole day.. . As I graduate this summer, I want to finish strong and also meaningful. So my friend and I created this Chrome Extension! Yes, there are tons of extensions for new tab productivity but I wanted something simple and clean. Crazyones Tab features inspiring quotes from great entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates! Plus whenever you open a new tab, you'll be able to see new quotes as well as your goals for 2021. We designed the extension to become a source of motivation + to stay on top of your goals for 2021.. . My friend and I started building this Chrome Extension as a side project and now it became the most meaningful and memorable part of my college experience. It's not perfect but I hope this helps to boost people's productivity and stop watching YouTube :). .

Now we're more than a year into a global pandemic that's killed enough Americans to fill the Big House *five times.* I don't need to rehash how unimaginable this loss is in all of our communities, all while seeing rapid periods of social justice change, political strife, missteps by University administration, and other world-changing events.. . I can't lie, this subreddit is really tough to read through some days. The varied accounts of lack of motivation, difficulty keeping up, that silly 'wellness day,' and endless work. I cannot imagine having to take classes and keep up right now. The Michigan curriculum is pressing enough as it is, but bearing the burden of the last year has surely amplified this. . . I wish I could give advice. I wish I could tell you to just suck it up and power through for a few more months. But I can't. I haven't been there. I haven't had to stay on top of classes during a pandemic. I haven't needed to attend Zoom classes all day. I haven't had to balance online class with online homework and online papers and online office hours and online *everything*. Just typing that sounds exhausting.. .

Would be moving with my partner and a dog so co-op and/or dorms are not really an option. Apartments in Ann Arbor seem overpriced for the space you get. Still want to be close to walkable neighborhood amenities like restaurants, bars, grocery, etc. Considering Midtown/ Medical Center area. If you have experience parking in the UMich lots, that would be helpful too. I don't mind the longer commute and paying the yearly fee for the garages as long as finding a spot is not impossible. Also, how far in advanced do you need to look at apartments? Thoughts?. . Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice. Detroit definitely out. Going to stick to AA and maybe Yps. Doesn't seem worth the extra commute time",neutral,0.6591487526893616

The solution implemented in hospitals is a scientifically motivated one and is safe. The same is true for the undergrad policy, it just does it a different way.. . I will leave the post here in case you want to know why I was wrong or had similar questions. Just know that all the conclusions below this line are wrong.. _____________________________________________________. . . I wanted to bring attention to what I thought was an interesting double standard in UofM's covid policy. I am not a doctor and the last time I took any health related science class was highschool so view my conclusion (that a double standard exists) with that in mind. But to the fullest extent of my knowledge, I do believe the statements I am making are true.. . Umich undergrads are required to be tested weekly if they have in person classes or want to use university facilities. The typical demographic of a u of m undergrad is a young adult with little to no medical problems that cause additional risk for covid. Undergrads primarily interact with other undergrads who are low risk also, but some undergrads are at risk and some undergrads interact with older, more vulnerable populations. UofM's conclusions from this was that it was safest practice to test undergrads weekly to prevent the spread of covid to at risk peoples. I will contrast this with their hospital policy.. . At this point most hospital workers have gotten the vaccine, but not all of them. Many hospital workers interact with patients who are immunocompromised. (Cancer patients, people recovering from surgery, etc.) It was recently made know to me that hospital workers(My source worked at Mott's) are not required to be tested even if they have not been vaccinated, and are not required to be tested unless they show symptoms. They fill out the responsiblue screening daily like students did first semester still, but no weekly covid test is required.. . This is the conclusions part that you should consider for yourself. My word is not any form of authority and should not be taken as one.. . It seems that the danger of a hospital workers getting covid and potentially spreading it to not only temporarily immunocompromised patients who do not have the vaccine or other employees who do not have the vaccine is much greater than risk of undergrad students passing the virus to at risk people, who they come into contact with much less frequently than hospital workers. There could be some sort of herd immunity at the hospital that I am unaware of, or some other factor I have never heard of that makes hospitals very unlikely to spread the virus, but I have not heard anything like that yet (Not meaning that it isn't there, but that I don't know if it is). Assuming that the hospital environment is comparable to other environments, it seems that either excessive precautions are being taken for undergrad students or that insufficient precautions are being taken in hospitals.. .

t3_m720kq,2021-03-17 14:46:21,"Got the chance to interview UMich Alum Anthony Chen, who is Employee #1 at Flexport!","Hey all!. . I got the chance to speak with Anthony Chen who attended UMich Ross as an undergrad. He joined Flexport as Employee #1 (the company now has 2,000 employees and is a market leader) and I asked him about his early days, what he's learnt, and what he's doing now.. . Thought I'd share in case anyone finds it useful. Cheers :). . \--------. . ## What were you doing before Flexport?. . I was working in Venture Capital (at a firm called Signia Venture Partners) in the Bay Area. I was an associate sourcing deals and doing interesting research. Coincidentally, between investing in Flexport and another YC company, Signia went with the other company.. . That other company was called Cruise, which got like a $2B exit in two and a half years, so that worked out well for them.. . Before the startup world, I was on Wall Street doing Investment Banking.. . ## So post college, were you always planning to do Finance? And was doing your own thing or working at a startup always at the back of your mind?. . So back then, startups weren't as big a thing as they are now. I saw Finance as the fastest way to pay off my student loans. I'm from an immigrant family, so I paid for most of my education myself. And investment banking let me pay off everything very quickly, within the first 2-3 years.. . As a result, though, I was nearly broke when I moved to Silicon Valley! So all that Wall Street money and bonus just went off to paying my student loans.. . ## That's interesting, because I read somewhere that even Ryan (CEO of Flexport) graduated from his MBA program with like 140k in debt and used his previous business, ImportGenius, to pay that debt off. So, you're working at this VC firm - what makes you want to join Flexport?. . My background was in Computer Science and Business, so I was always interested in technology. In undergrad, I also spent a lot of time starting and running organisations - starting teams, growing teams, scaling teams etc. And my parents also ran small businesses growing up, so I did a lot of that as a kid.. . International trade, freight forwarding, customs brokerage etc - it was all new to me, but because my dad used to receive cargo and stuff for his grocery store, it wasn't completely left field.. . The reason I joined after doing my due diligence was that a lot of the ""goldilocks"" ingredients were there. Ryan was a founder with two successful exits in adjacent industries. I had also done some research on unicorn startups and one of the commonalities was that most of the founders are in their early / mid thirties, have had a prior exit in a similar space, and are working on an enterprise company.. . https://preview.redd.it/lzvnallroln61.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8438e6d323b26cae6d9f9d680ebfcd0ba3e95cae. . So Ryan checked a lot of those buckets. The freight forwarding industry itself was fairly stagnant and ripe for disruption. We were one of the first logistics technology companies to emerge and get funding, so we did something right and helped open the floodgates for plenty of other companies.. . Finally, Ryan is a true entrepreneur and someone I wanted to learn from.. . ## Did you see joining the company as risky?. . When your bank account is small, you have nothing to lose. The only risky thing was not doing anything. I think that the challenge here is that when you leave something that is kind of a prefixed journey (step 1, step 2, etc), a lot of your friends and colleagues are going to really question what you're doing.. . Your colleagues will see it as a ridiculous risk and wonder why you're joining a no name company. But hopefully you'll also have some good friends who are supportive of what you're doing.. . I think that when you do a startup or join one at an early stage, you definitely take on risk but you have to trust that no matter what you have to learn or do something. The rest is all upside.. . ## What did you join as? Was Ryan even looking to hire someone at the time?. . The actual job post that Ryan had was for a jack of all trades. Given my background in engineering, business, and a little bit of design, it seemed to resonate and work well. Mix that in with family entrepreneurial hustle, that also was well received.. . And for folks who are looking to join an early stage startup, you have to have no ego and be willing to do anything and everything. My hats consisted of many things. I did ops, sales, finance, design and product.. . https://preview.redd.it/sl3prrivoln61.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4de8ebd3a33bf24999680e79da8b02c2420474c9. . ## Were you getting on the phone with customers at this stage too?. . Everyday. So from 9am until 5pm, we'd have a call every 10 or so minutes. Which means that the entire day we'd basically just be processing these customer requests, feedbacks, orders etc. And then we'd actually start the ""real work"" from 5pm to 10pm, or until later.. . The first year was very aggressive. I lived in Palo Alto at the time so I would be on the CalTrain by 7am, in the office in downtown SF by like 8:30, and then we'd work until 5 or 6, have dinner, and then work until around 10 again.. . Then, I'd take the CalTrain back to Palo Alto anywhere between 9pm to 11pm, get home, and work from 12 to 2 again. It was crazy because I had to work two shifts since we had both US clients and Asian partners. So when night came, Asia would wake up, and I'd need to be on the phone with our partners, factories, etc over there.. . ## In another interview you mentioned that when you were talking to your customers, you realized their needs were more than just customs clearance. They wanted you guys to manage their whole supply chain. When did that realization occur and is that when you truly realized the scale of the opportunity?. . The big picture scale was always apparent. Our trojan horse was customs, and that was the core business for a period of time. We never thought that the business would explode so quickly in terms of scope in the way that it did - that was serendipitous. A lot of it was just down to the fact that success compounds and we had tons of momentum behind us.. . To answer your question more directly - since we were on the phone all day with our customers, we got to know their pain points really well. What were they scared of? What sucked for them? These were questions that were really easy for us to answer.. . More generally, most people don't like to be uncomfortable. People don't like pain. But you need it. If you actually want to find out what problem needs solving, you need to feel the pain. If you don't feel the pain, you're not going to build the right thing and you're not going to be able to fix it.. . You're going to be working from an ivory tower and being all theoretical. So the feedback that we got over the first 3-4 months was overwhelming: our customers felt like their freight partners were often mismanaged their shipments, communicated poorly, coordinated poorly, and lacked accountability. No managed service... We wanted to step up and help.. . ## What did these early customers look like? Were you already landing enterprise customers or were these mom&pop shops?. . I think the majority of the early stage clients were mom and pop shops. Majority of them were just companies that were googling customs clearance and trying to look for someone to save their ass. And so usually, that didn't make for the easiest of customer problems, but it definitely showed us what was painful.. . To be honest, when we were more deliberate about the types of customers that we wanted to work with, we wanted to find people that were philosophically aligned with us. I think that's true for any partnership you should do as a business. And when we started doing that, we started to find customers who were growing much faster and wanted to work with us. So as you can imagine, a lot of startups and bay area companies resonated with our vision: ""to make global trade easy for everyone"".. . ## In one of your blog posts, you describe the distinction between working on the business vs in the business. Did you enjoy the evolution of your role into one that focused on building systems and ensuring everything ran smoothly? I know a lot of people that prefer just doing the stuff that takes a company from 0-1.. . Yeah, many of those rapid changes were a lot of fun and got to really test your mettle. I think the first few years it was a lot about turning the individual into institutional, reflecting about what was working and what wasn't.. . So, very systematically, every 2 weeks we had workshops that I led to figure out where the holes were in our process. We were very intentional about this - we didn't wait for an account exec or an ops teammate to slowly bubble problems up. We were still small, still lean, and our DNA said we want to solve problems.. . Everyone on the team felt like they were a true product owner and they were solving problems for the business that went beyond just their job title. Everybody was contributing to how we could improve the process and product.. . ## And I think another cool thing here is that I've read you guys insist on hiring generalists rather than experts. I'm sure that helped with building an org that is improving based on first principles and constantly rethinking the way processes are handled?. . Yeah, it was very deliberate. We wanted to have a good mix between experienced industry knowledge, experienced tech knowledge, and then the generalist problem solvers. By combining these 3 types of personas together, you created a very strong culture and also a dynamic that allows your team to ask questions like ""Hey, why isn't this tech possible?"" or ""Hey, why didn't the incumbents do something like this before?"".. . And that was very powerful. It made our feedback loop remarkably fast and agile.. . ## How do you scale culture? I know one of your big values is radical candor. And I'm wondering with so many offices now and a much larger number of employees, how do you ensure that these principles you've laid out are actually acted upon globally?. . That is an ever changing problem with an ever changing solution. So I don't have a perfect answer for you. What I can say, it's probably one of the biggest topics that every company will always need to keep on top of mind.. . Values stem from people. Things like hiring, managing, and coaching. All those elements are important and you need to be intentional about how you do each of those things. For example, are you looking for people that demonstrate these attributes we've communicated? Also, are you instilling the right positive feedback loop when they're being trained? Do they see that in practice? And then, do you lead or have managers that embody this as well?. . In regards to scaling this, it's hard. But in my opinion it just needs a real human touch. You are able to scale culture by having strong culture carriers and ultimately that means you need to have strong managers. I think having strong individual culture carriers is great, but if you have a manager that is a strong culture carrier, and they're able to recruit, manage, and lead, then that's a huge multiplier and you have a 1 to N dynamic.. . ## What advice do you have for others looking to join a very early stage venture?. . Make it so that your decision is a win-win no matter what happens. And if you feel like your decision is going to be a win-win no matter what happens, then go for it. Because you're going to be jittery about joining a new company, you're going to weigh the pros and cons, think about what the opportunity costs is, etc - and all of that is true.. . But what I mean by ""make it win-win"", is that you're able to make the best of the situation regardless of whether the company crushes it or has to fold. If the company does well, then great, you're in a win scenario. But what if, for some reason it fails? Do you still feel like you'd be able to pick up new skills? Learn from your leaders and colleagues? Push your comfort zone? And become more tempered? If so, then you've found a win-win scenario.. . ## What are you focused on now?. . I'm a light-weight angel investor, but I love working with founders and helping them navigate that seed to late Series A / early B stage. I enjoy helping them figure out how to hire, grow, and build. And ultimately, set up the infrastructure needed to get scaling ready and in place. By no means am I an expert in all these things, but I think for the Seed to Series B stage, my insights are helpful for a lot of entrepreneurs. I love working on those challenges.. . \------------. . That's it, hope it was helpful!. . *If you want to read more interviews like this + accelerate your tech career, you might like* [*my newsletter*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe)*.

I'm sort of confused on how the whole process works of being admitted to the pharmacy school after completing undergrad prerequisite classes at UMich. I understand that there is no such thing as a ""guaranteed program"" like in other schools, but what do they mean by ""conditional assurance?"" Essentially I am asking if getting into this program means getting a ""higher chance"" of being accepted to the School of Pharmacy, if I am guaranteed a spot given I complete the prerequisite courses/keep my GPA up, or if it gives me no advantage over any other applicant.

For background- I went to UM- Flint last year for my freshman year. Classes weren't too big, professors generally knew you by name, but the classes were pretty manageable. I worked a full time job while attending in-person classes full time as well. It was difficult at times, but man did i take it for granted. . . Now, ever since coming to Ann Arbor, I can't even think about my college experience without breaking down and crying. I took Orgo I during my first semester at UM- Ann Arbor per the suggestion of my advisor. Absolutely awful. One exam was so unfair the professors received hate Mail over it!! The average on every exam was like a 60%! Do you know how defeating it is to study on end for 20 hours PLUS for an exam and only receive a 60 percent?! Either these professors don't teach what they're testing over or they're purposefully torturing their students for trying. Either way this was the first sign that I had made a mistake by coming to Ann Arbor.. . Fast forward to this semester, I have survived orgo I and surprisingly got a B in the class! (This would be impressive if a B wasn't a 67%...) However, now I am confronted with the hate crime of a class called ""math 115.""

This class had been causing me mental breakdowns nearly daily at this point so a minor complaint was well warranted. I was hoping she would work with me so that I was not suffering just to pass a class I had essentially already taken. . . The email that I sent was extremely emotional and begged for any kind of help she could offer or suggest. It has been over a month since I sent this original email and she has decided to not respond. I sent her another email in response to my prior email, calling her out for not even responding- she has decided to ignore that one as well. Is it really too much to ask for a response from a professor who literally does none of the work for the course already? It's blatantly disrespectful to ignore the email that I had sent as it was clearly emotional and a desperate plea for any help at all that she could suggest. No response. . .

They keep claiming that they are there for their students but I have yet to hear that the students would say they have see any proof of this at all. It's just so sad. This was my dream school and it's ruined me. . . Does anyone else feel like this? Is this normal here? Is it only because the classes are online? Or is it always this bad?",error,0.0

t3_mhn3e1,2021-04-01 03:59:23,Fall 21 Admitted Grad Student Questions,"Hello. I've been accepted for the movement science (kinesiology) master's programme at U-M, which will commence this coming fall! I'm feeling absolutely ecstatic, especially since this will be my first time studying in the US. But that also means I'm not very aware of the university life/culture here.... . So, I had a few questions in mind that I hoped can be answered here:. . 1. Orientation - Will there be some kind of ""orientation"" week for the postgraduate students? Because we have ""fresher's week"" for first years in the UK, but they weren't really intended for the master's/doctorate students. Is it the same here? If the latter, are you supposed to just figure things out on your own?. 2. Commencement preparation - Slightly relating to Q. 1, I think I've seen somewhere that the official start date for U-M this year's fall will be 31 Aug: how much earlier do grad students typically return back to U-M? Is there anything going on that I should be aware of/preparing for before this date?. 3. Undergraduate vs postgraduate workload - What are your opinions on the workload shift from bachelor's to master's (specifically MVS MS)? For comparison, I had 6 modules in my final year of BSc, which consisted of a practical project, library project, a couple of in-course assessments (PPT/poster presentations etc.) 4 final exams and \~250 hrs total of lectures/tutorials/workshops in total.. 4. Social life as a grad student - I'm not really a hard party-goer, but I do like having a casual pint at pubs or going out to bars/nightclubs\* from time to time. What's the social life like for grad students (in normal cases as well, since the lockdowns seem to be easing)? Do grad students join in with undergrads when socialising/partying etc.? Because I always hung out with grads when I was an undergrad. Also, does U-M have a union/university bar that all students go to? By the looks of it on this subreddit, everyone seems to go to independent pubs/bars in Ann Arbor.. 5. Sports societies/clubs - I was an avid fencer, but I'm interested in trying out other sports like climbing, triathlon and shooting. Can grads join these clubs as well, or is it typically just for undergrads?

Edit 2: Please feel free to add anything relevant to this post. Anything will help!",11,"Fall 21 Admitted Grad Student Questions. Hello. I've been accepted for the movement science (kinesiology) master's programme at U-M, which will commence this coming fall! I'm feeling absolutely ecstatic, especially since this will be my first time studying in the US. But that also means I'm not very aware of the university life/culture here.... . So, I had a few questions in mind that I hoped can be answered here:. . 1. Orientation - Will there be some kind of ""orientation"" week for the postgraduate students? Because we have ""fresher's week"" for first years in the UK, but they weren't really intended for the master's/doctorate students. Is it the same here? If the latter, are you supposed to just figure things out on your own?. 2. Commencement preparation - Slightly relating to Q. 1, I think I've seen somewhere that the official start date for U-M this year's fall will be 31 Aug: how much earlier do grad students typically return back to U-M? Is there anything going on that I should be aware of/preparing for before this date?. 3. Undergraduate vs postgraduate workload - What are your opinions on the workload shift from bachelor's to master's (specifically MVS MS)? For comparison, I had 6 modules in my final year of BSc, which consisted of a practical project, library project, a couple of in-course assessments (PPT/poster presentations etc.) 4 final exams and \~250 hrs total of lectures/tutorials/workshops in total.. 4. Social life as a grad student - I'm not really a hard party-goer, but I do like having a casual pint at pubs or going out to bars/nightclubs\* from time to time. What's the social life like for grad students (in normal cases as well, since the lockdowns seem to be easing)? Do grad students join in with undergrads when socialising/partying etc.? Because I always hung out with grads when I was an undergrad. Also, does U-M have a union/university bar that all students go to? By the looks of it on this subreddit, everyone seems to go to independent pubs/bars in Ann Arbor.. 5. Sports societies/clubs - I was an avid fencer, but I'm interested in trying out other sports like climbing, triathlon and shooting. Can grads join these clubs as well, or is it typically just for undergrads? Also, are beginners allowed to join (I'm not really interested in joining/trying out for teams, just for social/recreational purposes\*)?. 6.

Imagine a semester with the freedom to hold in-person meetings or events, or even attend games in the Big House. . . A total of 7,500 doses of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine will be available to our students at no cost to you through two new sources. Vaccination is completely free. We sought out supply of this vaccine because it's the best option for many of you as the semester winds down, as *only one shot* is needed. One and done. Other vaccines require a second dose in 3 or 4 weeks.. . The Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine is highly effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. There is also accumulating evidence that vaccination prevents infection and transmission of COVID-19 to others. It has already been administered to nearly 4 million people and is very safe. This vaccine is only authorized for those 18 years old and above. All shots will be given by appointment only, and registration is required. . . You should get vaccinated even if you've had COVID-19 diagnosed in the past unless you're within 10 days of having had active COVID-19. . . Full details about how to sign up now for a vaccine are on our [Campus Maize and Blueprint vaccine page](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/vaccine). . . We know that it is both confusing and a hassle to have to check multiple places to try to get a vaccine appointment, but our goal is to help as many of you get shots in your arms as possible before the semester ends.

We'll administer shots to students at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor and in pop-up clinics at UM-Dearborn and UM-Flint. These will take place next week. The state has promised us additional vaccine in the coming weeks if they receive adequate supply from the federal government. . . Invitations will be issued via our [Blue Queue](https://record.umich.edu/articles/how-to-sign-up-for-blue-queue/) system. If you're among the thousands of U-M students who have already completed the full registration process and expressed interest in getting a vaccine, you're already eligible to be invited. Please check your MyUofMHealth.org account for more information and watch your email for an invitation from [donotreply@med.umich.edu](mailto:donotreply@med.umich.edu).

Invitations will be issued via our [Blue Queue](https://record.umich.edu/articles/how-to-sign-up-for-blue-queue/) system. If you're among the thousands of U-M students who have already completed the full registration process and expressed interest in getting a vaccine, you're already eligible to be invited. Please check your MyUofMHealth.org account for more information and watch your email for an invitation from [donotreply@med.umich.edu](mailto:donotreply@med.umich.edu). We'll send invitations in waves to randomly selected students beginning as early as tomorrow until all spots are full.. . If you have not yet completed the Blue Queue questionnaire or would like to update your vaccination interest, please visit [here](https://umichumhs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8oywy6UbWKIkx4p).. . **Meijer Pharmacy**. . U-M also has partnered with Meijer, which will provide 2,000 total doses of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine on April 15 and 16 at the Meijer Pharmacy located at 3145 Ann Arbor-Saline Road in Ann Arbor. . . Text GoBlue to 75049 or visit [clinic.meijer.com/register/CL0064](https://clinic.meijer.com/register/CL0064) to begin the Meijer registration process right away and schedule an appointment. . . **Additional opportunities**. . . . * We're continuing to seek additional vaccine supply from different sources for students, faculty and staff. Please continue to check our [vaccine page](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/vaccine) for updates. For instance, we worked with Kroger to administer 1,000 doses to students earlier this week from the chain's supply of the Pfizer vaccine. . . * We encourage all students to seek vaccination appointments from all sources. Michigan Medicine has posted tools to help [find vaccines in your area](https://www.uofmhealth.org/coronavirus/finding-vaccines). University Human Resources has created a [COVID-19 vaccine eligibility and availability page](https://hr.umich.edu/benefits-wellness/health-well-being/prescription-drug-plan/vaccines-tobacco-cessation#covid-19-vaccine) with resources to help everyone get an appointment through a clinic, pharmacy, health department or Michigan Medicine. The Campus Maize and Blueprint's [vaccine site](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/vaccine/) has information, as well. Washtenaw County is opening appointments based on the new eligibility guidelines.. . Thank you for your commitment to the health of our community. We know that this is a very busy time for our students, and we appreciate your willingness to seize this opportunity to be vaccinated and help us all enjoy more gatherings and in-person activities in the months ahead.. .

t3_morjvm,2021-04-11 14:23:58,"Incoming CoE Freshman Questions about WISE, MRADS, UROP, and project/build teams","Hey, everyone! This is my first reddit post so I'm sorry if the tone of this comes off as a little weird for reddit or if this is super long, I've got major issues with writing too much lol. I'll put a TLDR at the end of the post.. . I committed to the College of Engineering a few weeks ago and have seen a lot of differing opinion about these topics on the subreddit, so I wanted to ask about them in my own context to see if that changes anything.. . For a little info on me if it helps, I'm a girl currently debating on Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, or Data Science for a major and definitely want hands on type experience in some things before declaring anything. I can be pretty social if I feel like I need to be and generally get along well with the people I meet unless they're jerks or something.. . I love French and plan on doing a minor and a study/internship abroad at some point, but I'm pushing for one of the summer programs so it doesn't really affect anything else I might be doing.. . The plan as of rn is to apply to MRADS and WISE RP. If I do MRADS, that's pretty much it including a club or two, but if I join WISE, I'll also either apply for UROP or join a project/build team depending on the feedback I get here. I would do MRADS/UROP as work-study if I do them, but project teams seem interesting, too.. . I really like the idea of supporting/being supported by a group of women in STEM, but I'm not sure how I feel about fully female halls in housing even though I know Mojo is still a coed building. I like constantly being surrounded by all different types of people, and I'm not sure how different it feels living in one of those halls instead of a coed like I would get with MRADS. I also saw some people say that UROP is kind of shit compared to MRADS because there's more busy work and less community, but tell me if I'm wrong about that at all and if they're completely comparable besides the living situation.. . How are the meetings and required classes for WISE, MRADS, and UROP? Are any of them so boring or annoying that you would advise someone not to join that community?. . I've seen the websites for Solar Car, MASA, and some other teams, and I wanted to know what the time commitment generally was for someone who's pretty involved in a team or for someone like me who would probably do some small random work for at least the first semester considering my lack of experience. Is the time about the same as a research commitment, or would I also be able to do it with 6-9 hr/week research? Any opinions on the teams themselves, preferences on any teams, or even advice on whether or not I should jump straight in as a freshman instead of trying to do research would be helpful. If I don't join one as a freshman, I would still try to be in a project team during sophomore, junior, and/or senior year.. . Last question is kinda random, but I saw on the housing website that a bunch of buildings have a ""community kitchen,"" but I can't find anything about what that even means LMAO. Does that just mean the Mojo dining hall has a microwave and refrigerator for people to use when they need, or is it a whole kitchen that we can cook in if we have our own equipment when staff isn't in there? Not like I would cook every day, or even every week if I'm busy, but it would be nice to know if that option was there if I wanted to use it. I love to cook, but wasn't really expecting to get the opportunity until I moved off campus.. . Tbh I know that this sounds like I want to do a lot, but I genuinely want to take advantage of/experience everything that's available to me at umich, obv in a reasonable schedule and obv not actually everything since I probably wouldn't have the time. My mom pretty much made me stay in and didn't let me do much of anything in high school, so I really want to take the opportunity of this freedom to join what I want and run with it.. . **Tl;dr :** I want some advice on whether I should join MRADS by itself, or WISE RP with UROP. If you've had the experience or know about it, is there a big difference btwn WISE halls and MRADS halls since they're both in Mojo but WISE is all-female and MRADS is coed? Any huge differences btwn MRADS and UROP that you noticed besides housing? Is anything about any of the required courses or meetings in these communities super annoying or boring, or bad enough that you wouldn't encourage joining? What's your impression of the CoE project teams, and would you recommend any? How is the time commitment of a project time compared to doing research? Would you recommend joining a project team instead of doing research freshman year, or is it just as beneficial to join a team as a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th-year student?. .

Can you apply AP credits for these? Like APUSH and AP LIT? Or do you need to take 16 credit hours AT UMich?

I've heard that sponsors hire from these teams, and that job prospects wise, these clubs are better than research. Most of these clubs seem very mechanically focused.

t3_mtlpkg,2021-04-18 21:16:54,Opportunities for non-SMTD students,"Hi! . I recently found out after receiving the max LSA OOS scholarship that I may have enough to go to umich now. This is awesome as I love michigan of course, however, I was seriously ill this year and messed up a couple of my prescreenings, one of which happened to be umich. I got into more 'selective' colleges/conservatories for my instruments, but I'm on the fence on whether I should attend without the guarantee of a music degree with the teacher. However, I did not like the teacher for my instrument at the school I'm likely to be attending if I don't go to UMich (I couldn't afford my conservatories and this teacher has gotten sued by students for sexual harassment, was/is an alcoholic, and I walked into a meeting to hear him *screaming* at his students). I'm open to transferring only because I could not afford any of my schools this year and would apply on music to a different set, especially if I have to do an audition for UMich SMTD anyways. . . My question is; how am I supposed to take lessons or have musical opportunities that are at my level (or just below) if I'm not in the STMD? I got into Eastman, NEC, etc, but what if I don't get accepted to SMTD or the teacher doesn't like me for some reason? Is there anything else I can play in until I transfer if I decide to do that? To be frank, I have no idea how I was accepted EA when half of my application was severed by being rejected on music but I love UMich. I'm afraid I'm taking the real chance of never playing again. But I'm always one to gamble, and I believe I can be good enough to win, I'm just scared.",5,"Opportunities for non-SMTD students. Hi! .
