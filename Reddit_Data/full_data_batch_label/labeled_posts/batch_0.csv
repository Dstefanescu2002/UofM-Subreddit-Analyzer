The professors teaching this semester are below. I was thinking of just going to Kartik Prasanna's instead of my current professor (Martin Strauss) because its allowed. Does attendance to lecture actually help? Any suggestions?. . https://preview.redd.it/iffnb7xsy9k11.png?width=1353&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1ccf8e586c596814a826d89590331b0395e35fe1",negative,0.6991720199584961

I went to his office and the same thing took place and took forever to solve my problems when a GSI could've helped me just as much or more in half the time.. .

Next semester I plan on taking EECS 280, SI 110 or stats 306 and potentially math 217(I have credit for calc 1, 2 and discrete math). I'm also planning on taking 281 during the spring.. . I'm a really experienced programmer and the CS classes shouldn't be what is most difficult in comparison to my other courses(kinda weird but cs is my passion whereas classes like anthropology are not).. . . . maybe this is because midterms are upon us but I'm beginning to worry about my GPA and how that effects my employability in the future. I have no concern in doing well in EECS courses or technical interviews but I'm concerned if my GPA is 3.2 or something like that people won't even want to interview me.. . . . If there are any cs majors who can speak towards the effect of GPA in comparison to actual programming skills and how that effected your employability or ability to get hired for internships or jobs it would be greatly appreciated to hear your input.. . . . On a final note, as a student I believe in pushing myself to be the best that I can be, even if that means that my GPA takes a hit. I'm a bit torn because even in the midst of this post, I truly do not care what my GPA is, because I know the knowledge I'm accumulating in courses like linear algebra are far more valuable that other ""BS"" courses(within the realm of CS related careers).

I am thinking about chemical engineering as a major currently but haven't declared yet.. . Basically I am wondering:. . Other engineering students, in your opinion, what are the best classes to take at community college over the summer? Are there any engineering prerequisites that are notoriously hard? I was thinking about taking the equivalencies of Calc 3 and Physics 240.. . Those of you who did take some classes at cc, did you feel that it hurt you in upper level classes? Did you feel like other students who took the prerequisite at Umich had a greater understanding of the material? . . TL;DR. .

I didn't know much about the school, except that, statistically speaking, it was relatively easy compared to other schools I was interested in. Coming from a family who was interested in only pursuing prestige, they looked down on you. They scoffed at me for even considering you. My family had a myriad of friends who attended Ivies and other schools. They told me attending you would be the same as attending my local state school. I defended you. I pulled resources, statistics, research, everything. I wanted to prove them wrong, that Michigan was a different school entirely. I cheered for the sports teams, and I lit up every time I recognized those colors. Somehow, I convinced my parents to go and visit. Seeing the large campus, bustling with life, even in the summer, showed them what a great school this was. We crowded with people on central campus, and silently reflected in the tranquility of North campus. I even ran a lap on the open track on South campus. It was an 11 hour car ride there, another 11 hours back. Yet I didn't mind. It was worth it to know you a little better.. . . . As I grew to understand what Michigan was about, it came time to prove it. I had to apply to colleges, and you were at the top of my list. I knew I wanted to go for engineering, but I hesitated over Ross. After speaking to a couple students and making a post here, I decided to go for it. Ross it'd be. So yes, in addition to your behemoth 500-word essay on why michigan, I wrote another 500-word essay for Ross. I had a couple of friends at Ross check it out. Throughout this time, I followed Michigan football. I winced at the less than stellar performance against Notre Dame, but I cheered on and on for the wins the rest of the season. I watched as you steadily climbed to #4, and in a sense, I was proud too. Then it came time to prove it. I spent 4 hours of my life on my couch, watching that shit show of a game. My brothers annoyed me all the while, as they became OSU fans for the day to piss me off. I still believed in you. I believed in you even though Winovich couldn't come up with a sack. I believed in you after punt after punt. I believed in you until the last second, when OSU took a victory formation. Then I couldn't believe it. Throughout the game, I was glued to my phone, on the megareddit thread. I defended you against those fake fans who bemoaned the performance. Who jumped ship as soon as you were having trouble. Who pretended to have some insider wisdom all along, that they were right, Michigan sucked and always sucked. I told people who called for Don Brown's head to fuck off. And I cried for Winovich as people insulted him on Instagram. I cared for you. I still do.. . . . Today, I found out that my love isn't requited. Instead, you chose those who haven't followed you as intently as I had. Who couldn't give two shits about sports. I stayed with you through all that trouble, and this is the way you repay me?

t3_amzug5,2019-02-04 08:49:41,I'm so miserable here,"Throwaway for obvious reasons and sorry if formatting is shit (i'm on mobile). . . I'm an undeclared sophomore here and I can't begin to describe just how awful my time at Michigan has been. . . . I came from a pretty prestigious out of state high school that produces a lot of Michigan students, so coming into college I already knew a whole bunch of people, but regardless I was so excited to be a wolverine. My grandpa graduated from here and has always told me stories of his time here, claiming that college was the best part of his life.. . . But when I got here I found my experience to be wholly different from his. I guess my first mistake was not trying to make new friends here. I am awful at making new friends and I think I overrelied on sticking with people I knew from high school. This worked well enough until maybe halfway through first semester last year when those people started hanging out more with other people not from our high school. I increasingly was spending more time alone, but idk maybe out of anxiety or stupid ass pride I didn't put in the effort to make more friends. . . . Clearly this would bite me in the ass as now I have almost zero friends. The friends I do have are people who don't really care about social life and rarely ask to hang out or do anything. And often times when we do hang out they make me feel terrible about myself (more on this later).. . . What also sucks is my indecisiveness about my major. I applied as an LSA student but have basically spent all of college taking the prerequisites for transferring to engineering. I did this mainly bc my parents are very STEM oriented and hated the idea of me getting a liberal arts degree. So I've spent so much time taking hard af classes (seriously kudos to engineering kids for putting up with those bitch ass prereqs) that I had zero interest and passion for. Now, coming into the halfway point of college, I haven't really experienced the academic and exploratory freedom that I was so looking forward to. . . . Clearly all this wasn't healthy for me mentally and starting sophomore year I developed some pretty terrible depression; to the point where I would spend days at a time in bed, skipping classes, meals, showering, etc. I spent so much of my time just wishing that I wouldn't wake up, or contemplate dropping out of school altogether. Mental illness kinda runs in my family but my parents still have medieval era opinions on the matter. I don't want to get into the messy details of it but my parents threatened to disown my older brother bc he suffered from depression and asked if they would pay for his therapy/medication. So obviously trying to get a licensed therapist/getting antidepressants would've been a bad idea, so I've been going to CAPS. It really has been helpful and I'm glad that I started going but starting this semester they told me that they would have to limit how often I come in (down to a check-in once a month) so that they could make room for other students. I know CAPS is doing the best they can and I'm not mad at them at all, but if I can't get help from private practitioners or from CAPS I really don't know what to do.. . . I try so hard to join clubs every semester but really nothing has been sticking. I've tried traditional STEM clubs, community service orgs, cultural clubs, etc but I just can't seem to find a group where I fit in socially. I've spent days going through every single club listed on maizepages and idk if it's because I'm a pretentious fuck, or if it's because I'm a really uninteresting person, but I haven't been able at all to find a club that I'd be interested in joining. Rationally I know this can't be true but I also have no confidence in my ability to make friends from these clubs, or to even find the motivation to attend meetings regularly. I've also began thinking that I'm such a dull person (never got into video games, don't really listen to music, not super into sports) and hate myself for it. I know clubs are one of the biggest ways people make friends and I'm so sad bc I feel like I've missed out hard on that opportunity.. . .

On top of it all, on the rare occasion we do hang out, a lot of the time I feel like they make really hurtful remarks about me. Maybe I'm being too much of a pansy but a lot of the time they (for ex) joke about me being fat, which sometimes is funny ig, I have gained quite some weight since high school. But I also have pretty bad body image issues and used to force myself to puke a lot and so hearing them say that stuff kinda brings back some dark times for me. In all I just feel like I don't have anyone who I would really call a friend here.. . . I'm really sorry for this ridiculously large venting post and thanks to anyone who read any or all of it. I also am rereading all the stuff I just typed out and apologize if this post sounds like I'm begging for pity.

EDIT: wow formatting was actually terrible",124,"I'm so miserable here. Throwaway for obvious reasons and sorry if formatting is shit (i'm on mobile). . . I'm an undeclared sophomore here and I can't begin to describe just how awful my time at Michigan has been. . . . I came from a pretty prestigious out of state high school that produces a lot of Michigan students, so coming into college I already knew a whole bunch of people, but regardless I was so excited to be a wolverine. My grandpa graduated from here and has always told me stories of his time here, claiming that college was the best part of his life.. . . But when I got here I found my experience to be wholly different from his. I guess my first mistake was not trying to make new friends here. I am awful at making new friends and I think I overrelied on sticking with people I knew from high school. This worked well enough until maybe halfway through first semester last year when those people started hanging out more with other people not from our high school. I increasingly was spending more time alone, but idk maybe out of anxiety or stupid ass pride I didn't put in the effort to make more friends. . . . Clearly this would bite me in the ass as now I have almost zero friends. The friends I do have are people who don't really care about social life and rarely ask to hang out or do anything. And often times when we do hang out they make me feel terrible about myself (more on this later).. . . What also sucks is my indecisiveness about my major. I applied as an LSA student but have basically spent all of college taking the prerequisites for transferring to engineering. I did this mainly bc my parents are very STEM oriented and hated the idea of me getting a liberal arts degree. So I've spent so much time taking hard af classes (seriously kudos to engineering kids for putting up with those bitch ass prereqs) that I had zero interest and passion for. Now, coming into the halfway point of college, I haven't really experienced the academic and exploratory freedom that I was so looking forward to. . . . Clearly all this wasn't healthy for me mentally and starting sophomore year I developed some pretty terrible depression; to the point where I would spend days at a time in bed, skipping classes, meals, showering, etc. I spent so much of my time just wishing that I wouldn't wake up, or contemplate dropping out of school altogether. Mental illness kinda runs in my family but my parents still have medieval era opinions on the matter. I don't want to get into the messy details of it but my parents threatened to disown my older brother bc he suffered from depression and asked if they would pay for his therapy/medication. So obviously trying to get a licensed therapist/getting antidepressants would've been a bad idea, so I've been going to CAPS. It really has been helpful and I'm glad that I started going but starting this semester they told me that they would have to limit how often I come in (down to a check-in once a month) so that they could make room for other students. I know CAPS is doing the best they can and I'm not mad at them at all, but if I can't get help from private practitioners or from CAPS I really don't know what to do.. . . I try so hard to join clubs every semester but really nothing has been sticking. I've tried traditional STEM clubs, community service orgs, cultural clubs, etc but I just can't seem to find a group where I fit in socially. I've spent days going through every single club listed on maizepages and idk if it's because I'm a pretentious fuck, or if it's because I'm a really uninteresting person, but I haven't been able at all to find a club that I'd be interested in joining. Rationally I know this can't be true but I also have no confidence in my ability to make friends from these clubs, or to even find the motivation to attend meetings regularly. I've also began thinking that I'm such a dull person (never got into video games, don't really listen to music, not super into sports) and hate myself for it. I know clubs are one of the biggest ways people make friends and I'm so sad bc I feel like I've missed out hard on that opportunity.. . .

These are humanities students focusing on things like International Studies, Asian Studies, Psychology, etc. My first question is: Why?? Seriously, why would anyone triple major??? How can having three majors verus one or even two, give you any sort of advantage or legup in getting a job, landing an internship, or receiving some kind of scholarship/fellowship? Are employers really going to choose someone with 3 majors on their resume over someone who just has one? Frankly, I find it ridiculous why anyone would put themselves through the hell that is trying to fulfill the requirements of 3 different majors.. . I think this whole trend of triple majoring really speaks to the culture of ""being busy as a point of pride"" at Michigan. I constantly hear about people who basically brag about how they ""take 21 credits every semester, have a part time job, do research with a professor, are on the board of 3 different student orgs, etc."" all at the same time.

t3_az5nog,2019-03-09 17:14:32,Everything Wrong With Umich,"I'd like to take some time to discuss all of the serious flaws with the University of Michigan. This is all subjective of course, but I'm a graduating senior, I've attended other universities, three members of my family are former U-M faculty, and I've swapped stories about all this with people from many other colleges and universities. . . 1. The GSIs are terrible. They have little to no teaching experience, and habe no idea how to teach the basics of their fields. By definition, GSIs are graduate students--people who live and breathe their subjects at a very advanced level. They often just can't comprehend the fact that learning those subjects can be difficult at first, especially for those just taking the class as a requirement for another major. . . Yes, other universities do have TAs (basically GSIs), but they work under professors rather than just being thrown into classrooms alone (such as in the math, English, and foreign language departments). Courses are taught by professors or adjuncts who actually know how to teach the material, because knowing something and teaching it are two VERY different things. . . 2. Related to the last point, the exams are horrible. Classes at U-M are explicitly designed to ""weed"" the classes to separate the really extraordinary students from all the rest. It's just unreasonable to make exams so difficult that the instructors themselves (the GSIs) can't pass with flying colors, and that test things that were never even mentioned in class. . . My dad is a former U-M D professor, and he used to always take his own exams. If he couldn't get 100% in less than half the allotted time, then the exam was rewritten, because how could he expect to fairly grade his students on material that he didn't know? Similarly, I'm an elementary school teacher, and I write homework and study guides asking the same questions as the exam but with words/numbers changed, because the test MUST reflect the instruction. If more than 1/3 or so of my students miss a question, I consider it a failure on my own part to adequately teach the material. U-M seems to consider that a success, because their goal is to spot the top students and just throw the rest under the bus. . . 3. The university doesn't actually give a shit about its students' wellbeing. Something awful happened to me in a residence hall, and I fought tooth and nail to be heard for almost the entire school year. I provided undeniable concrete evidence, and was passed around, blown off, and outright accused of lying several times throughout the whole ordeal. The university also promises respite from some assignments during times of personal hardship, but this never panned out despite everything. . . 4. Its a bureaucratic mess. The last point is a great example of this.

Criticism on this sub always seems to get downvoted to Hell because ""Go Blue!"" but I think it needs to be said.",4,"Everything Wrong With Umich. I'd like to take some time to discuss all of the serious flaws with the University of Michigan. This is all subjective of course, but I'm a graduating senior, I've attended other universities, three members of my family are former U-M faculty, and I've swapped stories about all this with people from many other colleges and universities. . . 1. The GSIs are terrible. They have little to no teaching experience, and habe no idea how to teach the basics of their fields. By definition, GSIs are graduate students--people who live and breathe their subjects at a very advanced level. They often just can't comprehend the fact that learning those subjects can be difficult at first, especially for those just taking the class as a requirement for another major. . . Yes, other universities do have TAs (basically GSIs), but they work under professors rather than just being thrown into classrooms alone (such as in the math, English, and foreign language departments). Courses are taught by professors or adjuncts who actually know how to teach the material, because knowing something and teaching it are two VERY different things. . . 2. Related to the last point, the exams are horrible. Classes at U-M are explicitly designed to ""weed"" the classes to separate the really extraordinary students from all the rest. It's just unreasonable to make exams so difficult that the instructors themselves (the GSIs) can't pass with flying colors, and that test things that were never even mentioned in class. . . My dad is a former U-M D professor, and he used to always take his own exams. If he couldn't get 100% in less than half the allotted time, then the exam was rewritten, because how could he expect to fairly grade his students on material that he didn't know? Similarly, I'm an elementary school teacher, and I write homework and study guides asking the same questions as the exam but with words/numbers changed, because the test MUST reflect the instruction. If more than 1/3 or so of my students miss a question, I consider it a failure on my own part to adequately teach the material. U-M seems to consider that a success, because their goal is to spot the top students and just throw the rest under the bus. . . 3. The university doesn't actually give a shit about its students' wellbeing. Something awful happened to me in a residence hall, and I fought tooth and nail to be heard for almost the entire school year. I provided undeniable concrete evidence, and was passed around, blown off, and outright accused of lying several times throughout the whole ordeal. The university also promises respite from some assignments during times of personal hardship, but this never panned out despite everything. . . 4. Its a bureaucratic mess. The last point is a great example of this. It also took two years of hard work to FINALLY get my credits from Stanford transferred in (which were prereqs to classes I needed) and even then I only was only awarded 1/3 of the credits that I actually earned. I've ""been accepted"" three times. My acceptance documents were lost (and found again).

This is the equivalent of throwing someone in the deep end of a pool and expecting them to swim. Most people might be able to learn how to swim that way, but others will drown.

I feel like if there was a dedicated and organized group to go and do these things in, people would be more willing to take that risk to go and try new things and meet new people. Also, since this group's purpose will be to make lonely people more comfortable and feel accepted, people will come in knowing they have something big in common with everyone there. We all have similar life experiences, and will be more comfortable opening up and talking to each other about it, since we know that the other people will be more likely to ""get it"".

There's no shame in it, no ""what if they think I'm weird"" or ""I have nothing in common with these people"" or ""these people have known each other for years, I don't belong here"" because everyone's guaranteed to be in the same boat, there's no guessing factor. . .

I've learned from it and I'm doing a lot better in classes now, but It's gonna be an uphill battle and I'm gonna have to work to get my GPA to an acceptable point for med school. I also don't know if I'm doing enough in terms of extra curriculars. I'm treasurer of my dorm's multicultural council and a member of hall council, but I don't feel like it's enough. If anyone has any advice on how I can do more, specifically research or gaining any leadership positions, I would really appreciate it.

In the last few weeks, I have seen a frightening amount of posts related to mental health issues, anxiety issues, loneliness, etc, than I ever have before. This is frankly a very disturbing trend and I'm worried about my fellow wolverines. As someone who also deals with anxiety issues and has gotten help, Reddit is definitely not the first place people should go when they are struggling with these issues. Anonymous people online can only do so much and reading text off a screen is nowhere near as helpful as talking face-to-face with another human being who is willing to listen to you. With this in mind, I made this post because I have a few suggestions that I hope the mods will take into consideration to make this sub a more helpful place for people struggling with mental health issues.. . I believe this sub could benefit from two additions that can help students:. . 1. There should be a tab, or a hyperlink listed under the ""useful links"" tab, in the sidebar with links to various websites and resources on campus for students suffering from mental health issues. I think this is a no-brainer and even if only a fraction of the people who visit this sub notice that tab, it's still better than not having it there at all. . . 2. There should be a weekly sticky thread for people to vent, get certain thoughts off their chest or ask for help. This sticky thread would provide a place for students to talk to each other and provide advice or support and show people that they're not alone when it comes to the issues they're facing. It could also serve as a way to advertise offline meetups for students who want to make friends or who struggle with social anxiety. . . I really hope the mods take these suggestions to heart because I want all wolverines on this sub to have a great college experience and not have their struggles hold them down.

I'm moving into a new house for the next academic year, and I'm planning on bringing the furniture from my current house to that house.

As someone who is nearing the end of their time at Michigan, I would like to strongly argue for something that I think people sometimes dismiss out of hand: taking classes, primarily prerequisites at Community Colleges. If you are coming into Umich (or even if you are a returning student, with a clearer summer schedule), and your summer is looking pretty free, or maybe you are working a part time job, I would definitely recommend you take a couple classes over the summer. I did this before my freshman year - I don't want to say the classes are easy per se, but they tend to be less difficult than Umich classes, and on top of that, the grades don't transfer in, only the credit. Because of that, and a couple other factors, I can actually graduate a semester early, which saves me about 30K. And the classes are at community colleges, tend to be priced much more reasonably than classes here, even for in state students. I have attached two credit equivalency databases [here](http://www.ugadmiss.umich.edu/TCE/Public/CT_TCESearch.aspx) and [here](http://apps.engin.umich.edu/equivalencies/) for U of M: see if your local college is listed, even if the class isn't in your major (I am an EECS major, took Roman History at a CC, and loved it).. . Another option that I think is undervalued is online courses. Mostly they are not for credit (though some can be taken for credit), but they are a really great chance to brush up on skills, and learn some new ones. Michigan's Coursera page has a number of really interesting classes, particularly CS related, but both Coursera and Edx have a number of courses on a whole host of topics, including mechE, MSE, Deep Learning, Statistics, and even some humanities. Definitely worth a look. . The final thing I want to say, and this is a little out there, but it's an idea I have been thinking of for a bit - what if, while you are enrolled here, during either the fall, or winter, and you are slogging through pre-reqs, you take some of the some of those pre-reqs at Washtenaw. A number of common pre-reqs (Physics 1 and 2, Intro to Chem, Orgo 1 and 2, Anthro, French, Econ, EECS 183, as well as Calc 1,2,3,4, and Linear Algebra) transfer, and you will save a lot of money taking them there. Even better a class like calc 3, which is sometimes a GPA drag, won't be. Best of all, you'll still be in Ann Arbor, still have access to University resources, and still be able to study with all your friends.",24,"Advice for graduating early.

I've been admitted to the RC (as in there is space and it is up to me to decide now) and am also considering the LHSP. I love to write but am not even remotely talented in any other art forms such as dancing and singing. I've always wanted to learn Spanish (and never had the opportunity until now) so the RC's rigorous foreign language requirement would give me that opportunity too. But it does seem like RC students are on the whole more artistic than I am, and the RC requirements being 1/3rd of an LSA student's courses scares me a tad tbh.

I'm a high school senior who has 5 days left to decide where I will be going to college, and I have no idea which school to choose. I am deciding between the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Michigan. My ultimate career goal is to work for a professional sports franchise with front office operations. At UT, I will be entering as a business major in the McCombs School of Business, and eventually double majoring in Sport Management. On the other hand, at Michigan I would be going directly into Sport Management, which is in the School of Kinesiology. I'll list my pros and cons of each school to give y'all a better idea of my thought process:. . UT Austin: Pros. . * Emotionally attached to UT, grew up a Longhorn (see username). * More to do in Austin than Ann Arbor. * Much closer to family . * Present support system at UT, I know a few upperclassmen who are like brothers to me. * Have already made connections with UT '23 classmates as until lately I was sure I would be going to UT. . UT Austin: Cons. . * Staying in familiar territory/comfort zone could limit growth. * Being close to family could be viewed as negative as they can be toxic at times. * Sport Management program appears to not be as strong. * May be a good thing to get away from high school acquaintances. . Michigan: Pros. . * Going directly into studying sport management better fits career goals. * Slightly more nationally recognized/prestigious. * Housing is nicer than UT . * Smaller class sizes in Sport Management program allows for increased interaction with professors. * Sport Business Association leads to national and international connections (UT does not have a similar organization). . Michigan: Cons. . * Would arrive knowing virtually nobody and no support system. * Cold winters would be a culture shock to me. * Michigan not as compatible with dual credit courses I've taken as UT is. * Significant chance I would have to live on North Campus freshman year, which would be a huge pain in the ass. . Also, at this point in time finances are not a deciding factor. Probably should have prefaced with that. . . I would be infinitely grateful for any words of advice.

Recently, I've found myself in kind of a frustrating position. Forgive the length of this post- I'm trying to be thorough because I sincerely do not know what details are important here or not, and I am in the position that if I don't get aid, or if I don't get enough aid, that's it. I'm done. Out.. . . . I sent in my finaid documents by mail fairly recently. According to the USPS, they were delivered May 28th, according to Wolverine Access they were received the next day. Not ideal, but it took me a while to figure out all of the paperwork and how I was going to get it to them, not to mention being on the other side of the state from the documents until the second week of May. But hey, at least it made it there before the June 1 deadline that my 2019-2020 Estimated Award Notice (posted to Wolverine Access on April 25th) said I needed them in by. . . Then I get an email on June 7: ""The Office of Financial Aid has canceled your 2019-2020 estimated financial aid offer because required application documents were not received by the deadline."". . The next day, after gathering my thoughts, I emailed the finaid office about this, referencing the delivery dates and the June 1 deadline, as well as apologizing for cutting it so close to the deadline and asking that I not be penalized for submitting these documents late, because, at least at this point, I was sure that they weren't.. . . . Today I got this email (copied and pasted entirely- The typo serves to humanize the sender.): . ""Hi R,. . Our deadline for this year was 3/31/2019, which was different from previous years. We sent out various communications regarding this as well has had this this information posted on our website. Unfortunately, documents received after that deadline are considered late. I do see that we have all of your documents in however, which meas that we will be going back and reinstating some of your financial aid funding. This will likely occur here in July.. . Have a good day,. . {Name removed out of respect}"". . . . Now there are a couple of things with this email that really contrast with my experience: . 1. I have never before in my life seen this date in connection with finaid deadlines, despite reading through most of the finaid website and all communications from the university. (If you find it on the finaid website please comment the link and/or how you found it- I'd really like to know.). . 2. I have another document (mentioned earlier) that gives a different and much later deadline. . 3. I only got my admissions decision on April 12th, so as far as I know there really wasn't a way for me to have really known about this deadline or submitted my documents before it. I was taking 18 credits last semester, so I would also have been too busy to take care of that in a timely manner regardless.. . . . . I imagine it's possible that the deadlines are different for transfer students and new undergrads, and I just forgot to mention it in my first email that I'm a transfer student, or there is something else I'm missing, or something. But I'm really not sure how to move forward with this. Do I reply, saying what I've said here? What if the person on the other end is just some person they put in charge of responding to emails, with no real ability to change this situation? What if they do have that power, but dislike my tone?

However, I was looking at some of the research being conducted in the BME department and it looks like much of the ""exciting"" (to me at least) research is focused on the Data science and Electrical Engin aspects of BME. This got me thinking about pursuing a pre-med track under either of those majors. I know these majors would provide an unnecessarily difficult track to med school and probs have even lower GPAs than BME...but would a pre-med track with EE or DS be feasible? Alternatively, would a BME + DS dual major with pre-med track be feasible?

I'm planning to keep it this way while I drive around MI. More on why below.. . This December, I'm due for my biennial CA smog check. I must get one within the 90 days of the registration due date in December, or I can't complete my annual CA vehicle registration. Since I'm moving out to MI at the end of August, that is well before the said 90 days and I cannot yet perform a CA smog check. What should I do to keep my vehicle registered under the state of CA?. .
