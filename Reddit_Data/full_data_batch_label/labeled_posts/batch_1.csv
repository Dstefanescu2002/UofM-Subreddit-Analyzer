The Order of Angell, formerly (and perhaps more often) known as ""**Michigamua**"", is an odd, secret society that exists at the University of Michigan. The organization began in 1902, and, by all accounts, has continued every year since then - only allowing around 25 students in per year (though how accurate this figure is is unknown). Potential members are contacted privately, but casually, often through connections such as fellow students or staff. They're instructed to meet with some of the other members, and to consider joining. These members are typically students with some prominence or leadership roles- Football Quarterbacks, Hockey Captains, Fraternity/Organization leaders, sons and daughters of prominent figures, even former president (and football player) Gerald Ford was known to be a member. These students are often contacted in their junior year- to become a part of the Order for their Senior year (though how involvement persists after graduation is something of a mystery). . . . . Their intended purpose is unknown. Initially, in the few releases of information they would give, they would simply say something among the lines of ""Connect Proven, Diverse Leaders"", to ""Fight like hell for Michigan"", or to otherwise serve as leaders in the University. Despite this, there are sparse if *any* known events, actions, or initiatives directly backed by The Order of Angell, making their true purpose a bit of a mystery. . . . . At some point in the 1970s, it was determined that the group had started performing ""Rituals"", perhaps similar to those performed by modern Freemasons (think less sacrificing lambs and more performing theatrical performances in somewhat silly outfits). Details on this are unfortunately also somewhat unknown, but their official(?) website and other sources state that this had a Native American bend to it, which was found to be controversial (read: racist), leading to the name change from Michigamua to The Order of Angell. . . . . There are some accounts of an internal mascot of a Wolf, though I had some trouble substantiating this. . . . . That about all there is to it. While ""spooky"", in these situations the most boring and mundane answer is often the correct one. I would theorize that The Order of Angell, for the most part, is largely simply a tradition bound organization for wealthy, well-connected, and/or typically ""elite"" students within the University of Michigan to talk and 'network' and generally organize stances on various topics within the University of Michigan and surrounding areas. I could be jaded and wrong, but who knows. . . . . It should also be noted that the group went through some significant rebranding lately. While it was more of a ""secret society"", it's now rather public if you know where to look- even offering an entire members list.

t3_dlqooa,2019-10-22 23:41:27,Advice for Transferring from a great university with average grades.,"Hello, I'm a student at the University of Waterloo (2nd-year student) and am looking to transfer to UofM, because I'm a Michigan resident and for the amazing engineering opportunities there particularly with aerospace. . . Here in Waterloo, I have the grades of an average student, but every professor actively loves me because I ask a lot of questions in class, and am incredibly curious and ambitious. Hell, my materials engineering professor is helping me design my own Ion thruster to prototype in the University labs. I also have an amazing work experience with many companies, like working on research publications on self-driving vehicles (my former boss is getting his paper published in a few months!!!).. . But I do have an Achilles heel- my grades are average. Here, the class average is **75%**, and I have **70%**. Mind you that Waterloo is a top 100 university in the world for engineering, so it's not like 75% at a community college. This 75% is among some of the best engineering students I know. Hell, Waterloo is called the ""MIT of the North"". Just ask any CS student in UMich and they can give you some details about this university's toughness.. . I see that when people transfer into UMich, they have around 90-95% averages from community college, and I don't know how to compete with that. I admit I sacrificed a bit of my grade to work on stuff like Ion Thrusters, Jet engines, etc. Will the University of Michigan recognize and accept that my sacrifice was worth it? Note that because of this sacrifice, I got to work at the CNRC (Canada's equivalent to DARPA in the USA) on AI.. . What can I do to compensate for my GPA other than getting my old boss's (head researcher at the CNRC) and professors letters of recommendation, submitting my resume, and talking about my side projects on the essays? It's always been my life goal to work in astronautics, and I know for a fact that I have what it takes.

Hello all Post-Marriage Pact participants, we're working on an email later, but there's a few things we wanted to get out of the way.. . First of all thank you to all 7,200 of you! Most of you found your matches (for the better hopefully ?), and we even offered you some discounts to get the ball rolling , but there are some stats and issues that we probably have to get out of the way:. . 1. About **8%** of all of our participants weren't matched ; I wish we could match you, but either you were just too different from anyone else, or you were a victim of our women-men ratio. I truthfully am playing you a song on the world's smallest violin rn . 2. Our algorithm talks to mcommunity to determine whether or not a participant is IRL an undergraduate, and not some bot or fake account. That being said, sadly some participants got through our defenses, and for this we apologize. **Feel free** to get those discounts anyway though, I'm sure the restaurants will understand . 3. We've gotten some reports of user's being paired with someone who doesn't match their sexuality. We freaked out about this too, **I promise**. , but after having some user's retake our survey format, and running some tests with our algorithm, we've determined the issue was that someone entered their sexuality wrong when they were taking the survey. There's just no way that the algorithm could've messed up this parameter . There's always next year though?. 4. Overall though, the matches were a success! And we've taken lots of feedback for improvement in the future. If you have something to add, go ahead!

Let me walk you through a week of a stats 250 student:. . First, you have the homework. The homeworks only have like 10 questions, but when you factor in the fact that some questions will be subdivided in as many as 12 different parts (no bullshit, last week had a question that went 3a, 3b, 3c, etc. all the way up to 3l. 3 FUCKING L!?!?!), you get like 3 hour long marathon stats homework sessions with your friends where you just pray the next question is a multiple choice so you don't have to spend 30 minutes writing np>10, n(1-p)>10 and other useless bullshit for half an hour just to solve one part of one question.. . So after you get through all that, they still come at you with a prelab every single week due on Monday morning, meaning I have to interrupt my Sunday night football viewing by fucking around making graphs on Rcommander. I know this gets said a lot, but I actually can't think of any information less useful to regular, everyday life than the knowledge of how to use Rcommander. It's just more ticky tack bullshit added on to a course that is tailor-made to waste your time. Thankfully, prelabs actually only take like 15 minutes but still fuck you stats department I hate you.. . Finally, there is lab. Lab is where you sit around playing games on your phone for an hour and a half while your gsi talks over a PowerPoint, every so often throwing in an iclicker question just to ruin your Mario kart mobile race while you're in 1st place going into lap 3. At the end, you fill out a little worksheet and walk out of the class 1.5 hours older and 0% better at stats. I can say with 99% confidence that in a hypothetical scenario in which lab was optional, the true population mean difference between exam scores of students who go to lab and students who never attended lab would fall somewhere between 0 and .34. That's how useless lab is.. . I'm not even gonna bring up lecture, because I don't go, because it's optional and I'm not going to waste even more of my time on this stupid class. In conclusion, fuck stats, fuck Michigan for making it a requirement for like every relevant major, and fuck you if you do better than me on the exam tomorrow because I have been on a 72 hour long Ritalin binge teaching myself this stuff using practice exams and google since that is a way more efficient way to learn stats than doing any of the stupid shit they make you do for this class.

Now this freaked everyone the fuck out, and we all thought that there was someone outside with a gun or something and that we were gonna get shot.

t3_e38vd9,2019-11-29 03:19:22,when you are feeling low,"Hello, . . I saw this in some other post. I figure it might be helpful for people feeling low from time to time out there, myself included for sure. . . Happy holiday everyone.. . . . . . [https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/aelmkt/some\_insights\_from\_a\_professor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/aelmkt/some_insights_from_a_professor/). . Hi all, I've been teaching at Davis for the last three years (on sabbatical this year). In my smaller classes I normally make it a required assignment that students come to one office hours appointment during the quarter, so I've spent a lot of time over the last three years talking to you all. I wanted to share some things I have learned during that time.. . 1) *No, everyone doesn't already have their friend groups sorted out.No, you aren't the only one that is lonely or having a hard time meeting people. Yes, it is harder to meet people through clubs than everyone says.*. . This is a running theme with all my students. They discuss being lonely and feeling like they missed some important window to make friends. They discuss how it seems like everyone is already paired off besides them and how they go to clubs, which is the conventional ""how do I meet people at Davis?"" advice but they still can't seem to meet people. Making friends is hard, making friends at Davis is extra hard. People are very friendly but I think few people have the capacity to be real friends. Keep going to club meetings if you enjoy the people and the space, try something different if you don't, but don't keep going if you don't like it hoping to meet people. You might to need accept that people here are busy and it might be a lonely few years for you. I guarantee you that the people that seem soooo happy with soooo many friends for the most part aren't. I have had SO many queen bee sorority girls and frat guys who appear to be swimming in friends break down in my office because they also feel like they don't belong and can't meet people (while surrounded with people). So even the ones that look happy generally aren't and it isn't just you. Its also never too late to find people, even if it comes in your second or third or fourth year.. . 2) *There is a weird code of silence at Davis where we all act like we love the school, the city, and the lifestyle so much and no one is ever suffering.*. . I don't know why but Davis has a bit of a cult thing happening. If you love Davis great! I am happy you have found your home and your tribe. But if you don't love it, and you feel alone in that, you aren't. And its okay not to love it. I know no one will ever admit it but lots of things about Davis suck. The quarter system is awful and cruel. The weather can be hard to handle. Housing is impossible. Its okay to be stressed. Admitting you don't love Davis probably won't win you any friends because for some reason it is a sin to talk about anything negative at this school, but again, more of you than you would believe are having a really hard time. I absolutely promise you that.. . 3) *Yup, you spend most of your day feeling stupid, feeling less than, and feeling like you aren't smart enough for Davis.*. . So do lots of your fellow students. Almost every student who I have taught in the last three years feels stupid at Davis and like everyone else is smarter than them and they have no idea what is going on. Other people are not smarter than you, I know, I see their grades. The ones that aren't worried about feeling dumb are the ones that should be.. . 4) *No, everyone else doesn't have it all figured out.*. . I start every quarter by sizing up my classes. Who is the class clown, who are the ones that will participate, who are the ones that I don't have to worry about, and who are the ones I will have to try to remember exist, because they say nothing and have very little presence. I myself am consistently surprised when the students I don't think I need to worry about, because they seem to have it all figured out, come into my office and fall to pieces because they have no idea what they are doing. It isn't just you. Below the surface like 80% of you are totally lost. Its just that no one will admit it. Its NORMAL.. . Davis may be, up until this point, one of the hardest things you have ever done. You may feel dumb, lonely, lost, and depressed. But you aren't alone. If you find some people that seem a little less fake than the normal try opening some of that up a little, you will likely find others feel just like you but can't drop the walls long enough to admit it. You may need to accept that Davis won't be all the things you wanted. You might not make lifelong friends. You may not retain your perfect GPA. You may not get invited to a party every weekend (hell or any weekend). But the years go by fast with the quarter system and you will be graduating before you know it. If nothing else, find a way to keep your head down and get through the work. Maybe make a priorities list. Ask yourself what you *really* want from this experience and focus your energy there. Are friends and a traditional college experience your priority? Is it personal growth? Travel? Finding a career? Or just getting the degree? You likely can't have them all, because we are all only human and the quarter system will take so much from you as it is. Focusing on some realistic priorities and not setting yourself up to fail by trying to have all the things and then feeling like shit when that doesn't work is what I have seen make this experience worthwhile for a lot of my students.. . Best of luck to you all. Remember, whatever it is you are feeling, you aren't alone.",172,"when you are feeling low. Hello, . . I saw this in some other post. I figure it might be helpful for people feeling low from time to time out there, myself included for sure. . . Happy holiday everyone.. . . . . . [https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/aelmkt/some\_insights\_from\_a\_professor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/aelmkt/some_insights_from_a_professor/). . Hi all, I've been teaching at Davis for the last three years (on sabbatical this year). In my smaller classes I normally make it a required assignment that students come to one office hours appointment during the quarter, so I've spent a lot of time over the last three years talking to you all. I wanted to share some things I have learned during that time.. . 1) *No, everyone doesn't already have their friend groups sorted out.No, you aren't the only one that is lonely or having a hard time meeting people. Yes, it is harder to meet people through clubs than everyone says.*. . This is a running theme with all my students. They discuss being lonely and feeling like they missed some important window to make friends. They discuss how it seems like everyone is already paired off besides them and how they go to clubs, which is the conventional ""how do I meet people at Davis?"" advice but they still can't seem to meet people. Making friends is hard, making friends at Davis is extra hard. People are very friendly but I think few people have the capacity to be real friends. Keep going to club meetings if you enjoy the people and the space, try something different if you don't, but don't keep going if you don't like it hoping to meet people. You might to need accept that people here are busy and it might be a lonely few years for you. I guarantee you that the people that seem soooo happy with soooo many friends for the most part aren't. I have had SO many queen bee sorority girls and frat guys who appear to be swimming in friends break down in my office because they also feel like they don't belong and can't meet people (while surrounded with people). So even the ones that look happy generally aren't and it isn't just you. Its also never too late to find people, even if it comes in your second or third or fourth year.. . 2) *There is a weird code of silence at Davis where we all act like we love the school, the city, and the lifestyle so much and no one is ever suffering.*. . I don't know why but Davis has a bit of a cult thing happening. If you love Davis great! I am happy you have found your home and your tribe. But if you don't love it, and you feel alone in that, you aren't. And its okay not to love it. I know no one will ever admit it but lots of things about Davis suck. The quarter system is awful and cruel. The weather can be hard to handle. Housing is impossible. Its okay to be stressed. Admitting you don't love Davis probably won't win you any friends because for some reason it is a sin to talk about anything negative at this school, but again, more of you than you would believe are having a really hard time. I absolutely promise you that.. . 3) *Yup, you spend most of your day feeling stupid, feeling less than, and feeling like you aren't smart enough for Davis.*. . So do lots of your fellow students. Almost every student who I have taught in the last three years feels stupid at Davis and like everyone else is smarter than them and they have no idea what is going on. Other people are not smarter than you, I know, I see their grades. The ones that aren't worried about feeling dumb are the ones that should be.. . 4) *No, everyone else doesn't have it all figured out.*. . I start every quarter by sizing up my classes. Who is the class clown, who are the ones that will participate, who are the ones that I don't have to worry about, and who are the ones I will have to try to remember exist, because they say nothing and have very little presence. I myself am consistently surprised when the students I don't think I need to worry about, because they seem to have it all figured out, come into my office and fall to pieces because they have no idea what they are doing. It isn't just you. Below the surface like 80% of you are totally lost. Its just that no one will admit it. Its NORMAL.. . Davis may be, up until this point, one of the hardest things you have ever done. You may feel dumb, lonely, lost, and depressed. But you aren't alone.

So I took the leap and transferred to LSA with the hope of declaring as a comp sci major and art and design minor. As it stands ill be fine for a minor....probably... I hope.

t3_e78fae,2019-12-07 02:20:22,Here's my f*cking assignment for your consideration.,"What can I say about my experience at UofM.... . I can praise the quality of education but who am I to gauge. I learned a lot during my time here. Much of that information was from faculty from the university. . . I guess my problem with this question is the implicit call to praise UofM. By the tone of these sentences, it may be obvious that I very much hesitate in doing so. I can preface my criticisms by saying that I have met and learned from the smartest most talented people I have ever come across, and I grew into something I am proud, here. I am grateful to the admittance board for deciding I was worthy of that. I am grateful that I will have a degree that will open doors because of the name of this university rather than my qualifications alone... . . . I am grateful for the friends I made and the success I am achieving through the university.... . However, much of that journey was wrought with break downs, suicidal ideation, and a repressed frustration I am now taking this opportunity to vent.... . One early frustration I need to mention is the feeling I can sense coming from the reader, through spacetime, into my phone as I type this. ""No pain no gain!"" The unreasonably simplistic solution presented from nearly everyone who goes here, to a problem faced by nearly everyone who goes here. The excuse for a poorly designed system, justified and perpetuated by the ego that is gained from success in that system... even if that success is temporary and/or theoretical. . . . But it's ok, CAPS is always available, and we are comforted in the knowledge that we are all suffering together! . . The UofM culture prides itself in the rigor given to its students, but is this something to be proud of? Is it an achievement to make assignments that require 10s of hours of work on, given a deadline that strongly encourages the loss of sleep and a healthy lifestyle? The university systemically promotes students to sacrifice quality of life and mental health to get a better grade. One of the first recommendations from my advisor was to make sure I take time to walk around outside... I now see this was because being cooped up in a lab until 3:00AM can be a negative on your moral.. . The second problematic factor I see in this system is the method of evaluation.. . Exams, homework, labs. Nearly every class is flooded with tedious work that fails, or completely ignores, the target being evaluated (i.e. has the student learned x) and focuses on increasing length of the evaluation method (i.e. can the student complete this assignment in the time limit). The methods of evaluation often do test for knowledge of different pertinent material (although many times incompletely), however they almost always involve an unholy amount of tedium and memorization. . . In my opinion, the most frustrating result of the evaluation process is the false negatives. I have run into dozens of occasions where graders and professors have both given me feedback that are along the lines of:. . ""its obvious you know the material, but what you wrote was incorrect on a technicality."". . More often than not, I demonstrate that this technicality is something I am aware of and proven that I do elsewhere, but perhaps, for example, I misread a question. I am of course always willing to demonstrate it again, but this is rarely an offer taken. . . Lemma 1:. . If a professor/grader evaluates a student as not knowing something that the student has or is willing to concretely demonstrate their knowledge in, the failure is not of the student, but of the evaluator and/or the evaluation methodology.. . To give an even more radical idea: . . A successful system of education does not require lemma 1 to be dependent on deadlines within of a semester. . . (See: many other countries). . My experience at UofM quickly became inundated by the feeling that the university did not have the goal of my success and was in fact out for blood. . . I have failed assignments, exams, nearly some courses, and a course, all whilst having verbal confirmation from those corresponding professors that I am one of their top students - asking all the right questions, engaging with the material, helping other students understand concepts. These failures were overwhelmingly due to the insane workload and the negative feedback loop that it had on my mental health. . . I guess I can separate my experience into three chapters: pre-hospitalization, pre-research, and now. In each chapter I can tell you the lessons I have learned, some of them useful outside of the university. . . Pre-hospitalization:. . During a period that I was pushed to my tipping point, I had a 2-hour exam for one of my courses. I had a panic attack during the exam and due to the time left after calming myself I had to fill in a few answers with educated guesses. If this didn't affect my grade enough, at the last minute I realized I marked my answers off by one for nearly half my exam. After failing that exam and ultimately taking a blow to my GPA, I became very depressed and isolated. I felt so wronged by this experience. I felt that my knowledge was irrelevant to my grade. I felt that my professors could hardly care about their undergraduates students' successful retention of material, and were just going through the motion, focused on their own research, teaching as a formality. . . The next semester I had a nervous breakdown - I was completely disillusioned and terrified. The experience left me checked in at the psychiatric emergency center at the UofM hospital. I considered leaving UofM. I was very close to doing so. Against the advice of my father, and therapist, I stayed. I stayed because I wanted to triumph my demons - a sentiment I think is silly in hindsight. I bought into the idea that this pain was part of the UofM experience, when in actuality the most profound step into self-mastery was when I had a break from it all (as I will mention later).. . I learned that I am either a false negative or a false positive - either the system is wrong, or I don't belong in it. But university assured me that I do belong here, and my skepticism about it was just imposter syndrome. So, I reasoned that in a system as complex as an educational institution, false negatives are either not effectively tracked or not effectively cared about. . . Pre-research:. . I am recovering and part of that recovery is to allow myself to be angry and speak up for myself - to self-actualize. I took it easy for a semester. When things got too hairy, I dropped classes. I moved out of my crappy dimly lit dorm. I made time for archery. However, the most profound experience of, quite possibly, my life, was during three weeks of a summer I spent alone, with my time, with my ambition, with my confidence, with my talent, and without micromanagement. I decided to learn on my own and build projects myself. I woke up early naturally because I was motivated and well rested. I made amazing strides in my mental health. . . I learned that I deserve my time. . . . Now:. . The rest of the summer I decided to get into research to open up the possibility for grad school. After not hearing back from my first choice professor, and after my academic advisor reassured my interests by telling me it was pointless to try to go to any of the big schools (including UofM) because my GPA was under 3.5 (3.3 at the time), I decided to ignore both and apply to another lab last minute. I have been told I nailed the interview. I began working under/with people I now consider to be my first friends at UofM - definitely the first people to give a shit. I felt valued for my research ideas and insights. I felt like I was finally doing science and not being quizzed in some fundamentally flawed system that sees me as a name, ID number, and the one professional looking photo I had available to put on my ID. The research community has many downsides, and a similar unhealthy mindset of work until you finish or break down, but surprisingly not to the same extent, and the liberty and respect of self-management and goal definition is... liberating. . . Unfortunately, summers end, and seeing the other side of the tunnel made the length and mucky constricting nature of the tunnel feel even more infuriating. I had friends, respect, and other positive reinforcement from research, but since research only counts for credit once at UofM, I had to try to balance both. I was in a semi unique position as a student and researcher, and I saw the table from both sides. I also saw the ugliest parts of both worlds... . . . Faculty and grad students harassed and discriminated against. Professors getting away with threatening and verbally abusing students. I fell victim to all of the above as well, and I saw the universities disappointing reaction (or lack thereof) to the situations. . . Eventually research led me to make my own business. Because of my limited time I had to drop research. But I am now at this point of being frustrating clear on the illogical methods of evaluation and the toxic culture this university prides itself in. Seeing the behind the scenes just makes consider dropping out rather than taking my last semester.. . I learned that the university holds their students to a higher standard than their faculty. I learned that not considering the specifics of a situation during evaluation is the duct tape that holds the university together and it's the birth of a great many of its injustices. I learned that your heroes are probably just assholes. I learned that the real talents to be treasured at this university are taken advantage of, over worked, underpaid, disrespected, harassed. I learned that big name faculty can get away with anything. I learned that those here on a visa are especially vulnerable to abuse. I learned that the red carpet will be rolled out for the most unnervingly problematic, manipulative, and abusive faculty, but the university will find any reason to put a glass ceiling above an extremely skilled, hard-working, faculty with an integrity that restores my hope in academia. I learned that this is commonplace when the first is a man and the second is a woman.. . I learned that the most talented people I have ever met flock here only to get their dreams slowly chipped away at, until they eventually question their value and if they are worthy of being here.",158,"Here's my f*cking assignment for your consideration..

I've had my thoughts and feelings brushed off by therapists and psychiatrists before. I've been told things that they really had no right telling me. All around me, I see discussions about mental illness which strip sufferers of their humanity, or which paint us as monsters. As someone who also has a personality disorder (and one of the cluster B personality disorders, at that), that segment of our class was deeply uncomfortable. Some of the ways which students reacted to this important conversation were highly inappropriate.. . One of my two majors is psychology. It's so easy for people to label those who suffer from mental illness as just their diagnosis. It's also common for people to refuse to actually listen to the concerns of those who suffer from mental illness when discussing mental illness. We MUST be a part of this conversation, as we are the ones who are affected the most by it. You can study all you want, but you will never truly KNOW until you've been through it.. . OCD sounds like a cute disorder, but it is hellish. I would wash my hands until they cracked and bled whenever I moved my fingers. I would force myself to pray for 4 hours at a time, usually bursting into tears, because my intrusive thoughts would interrupt me. I cannot clean or touch dirty clothes without wearing gloves. The more horrific intrusive thoughts can be so bad that I can do little more than slump down on the floor and sob. It takes up so much of my time and energy, and I'm one of the lucky ones. I have access to treatment and my symptoms have become more mild over the years. You may KNOW the symptoms but, unless you know what it's like to constantly have to Lysol everything, to have to sanitize your hands after touching your shoes, to be unable to sleep in your bed because you fear that there may be germs there, you do not UNDERSTAND them.. . We were talking about OCD in class. I offered an example of something as someone who has OCD because I want other people to be able to see how it affects me and to have more respect for those suffering from this illness.

I have had a good few years of experience with programming in particular.. . What I wanted to ask about was this: I'm definitely going to take at least one EECS course over the Spring. Seeing some of the posts here, I think it may not be a good idea to do both 281 and 370 together, at least over a half-term. However, would it be doable to do 281 and 376 over the Spring if they are offered? Or should I do 281 and work on my foreign language requirement (French)?

t3_echxgq,2019-12-18 20:15:11,Presenting idea to UMICH RecSports about new IM Game - Nerf Blasters/Nerf Archery Tag,"Hey everyone,. . So I've been trying to get more feedback lately about this idea from my coworkers and friends regarding an activity that is not essentially just sport related, I.E basketball, volleyball, or flag football. Where those are great, I feel some students who lack prior sports knowledge would be discouraged to participate in something like this. At first, I didn't think this was the case but after asking people that attended the CCRB and NCRB on a daily basis I came to find this was true. Personally, I enjoy all the IM sports provided but I thought of presenting an idea to my boss about implementing another IM game that would be both more open and goofy. . . So the premise around this is that I want to make a team based game of tag, utilizing either nerf blasters or the bow and arrow sets they have. I am not sure how many of you here RSVP'd for the nerf archery tag tournament hosted during this past semester but I heard a lot of good feed back from participants and watching it looked like a lot of fun. Therefore, I just wanted to see if anyone would be willing to voice their opinions or even show interest in something like this? . . To gain a bit of presence on how a game of this would work, similar to the Nerf Archery Tag, there would be blown up pieces of equipment (basically balloon style covers) that would provide areas of protection to avoid being tagged. As well as there being a flag in both team's area, in a sense, playing capture the flag. Every member of the team will have one chance for the round, after they are tagged by an arrow or two hand touch. The player is out for that round. There could be several rounds played to deem the winner and so on. . . At the moment, I am not sure where we would even host an IM game like this or when since playing this outside may damage the equipment but playing this inside may become chaotic since clean up may be an issue with other participants and with the area in general. . .

I was talking with a friend who also took the class and we both felt we did better than our grades showed.. . So I used an excel spreadsheet to calculate what my grade should be according to what is in gradescope and it turns out both of our calculated grades using the syllabus weightings are significantly higher (1 to 2 letter grades) than our transcript grade we received recently.. . This is only my first semester here but I even know this class was organized pretty poorly this semester and the fact that we still have ungraded homework from the beginning of October and we already have a final grade is obnoxious.. . Anyways, if you took math 214 this semester I'd encourage you to calculate your final grade to double check the accuracy of your transcript grade. Because I believe that there may have been a mass error with the grade calculation unless there is a discrepancy I am not aware of. I emailed the class coordinator about my concerns so I'll see if he gets back to me as well, and I'd encourage any one of you with a concern to do so as well.. . As far as my spreadsheet calculations went, I used the syllabus on the course site for my weightings and the final project description pdf to calculate the weightings of my overall final project grade, as well as the webwork website and gradescope for grades. I ignored all of the ungraded written homework and the 2 unreleased webwork assignments that I just discovered (9 and 10).. . There are 2 places my calculation method (or the class's grading calculations) may be wrong:. . 1. For the webwork grades page, it says there are webworks 9 and 10 that were never released but are counted in the overall grade. On the course site it was explicitly told that there are only 8 webworks and I never had my professor mention the 9th and 10th ones. Also when you click on them, it gives an error, so im not sure what that means. Anyways, even if I count the ww 9 and 10 as zeros in my grade I should still have a higher letter grade than my transcript shows.. 2. The written homeworks 3, 4, 6, and 7 have not been graded yet. This is obviously potential for a major change in grade but with my personal grades, there is still enough of a gap between my calculated grade and the next letter grade mark boundary for a change in my homework scores to not affect the resulting final grade. I'm not sure how the professors calculated our final grade already without 4 of the 7 homework assignments or if they will even grade them eventually but this is also a major complaint about the class as already discussed in another post.. . Anyways this whole matter is very frustrating and there hasn't been much transparency between the students and the class staff other than a few scattered canvas announcements saying they are running behind.. .

I'm looking for anyone who is interested in joining/creating a student team, even if you do/don't share a passion for fitness and want to be a part of a design/ideation team! **Roles I am looking to fill** with specific backgrounds:. . \-**Design/art:** (To help with designing the layout for the clip and maximizing the appropriate technical necessities, and UX/UI design for the mobile device). . \-**Engineering:** (To help with implementing the different components in the clip such as its gyroscope, accelerometer, and various IMU's, while working to create a cheap/effective alternative). . \-**CS/Data Science:** (To help with organizing and leading an independent project team to create/design the Athletic Management System for the mobile device and create an easy-to-use prototype). . \-**Marketing/Sales/Finance**: (To help with Customer Discovery and determining the overall market niche we want to target while maximizing the cost of the clip itself). . \-**Kinesiology**: (To help determine the appropriate metrics for the clip/mobile device such as VBT, BTA, and incorporating that into a chronic training method). . **-Anyone with a passion for fitness!!** (To help with creating working project business templates, and organize team meetings/talking to various strength coaches on campus to look for currently used alternatives). . I've been working on this project for around 6 months now and am looking to create a working MVP by summer time so that we can start pitching for grant money through various organizations on campus to continue to develop this idea. Again, anyone is welcome as long as you're passionate about any one of the ideas i've brought up! I'm hoping to meet at the beginning of this semester to start discussing how to move forward, and any criticism below is appreciated.. . PM/Comment if you would be interested!",error,0.0

I was accepted into Ross at Michigan and McCombs at UT Austin (I was rejected from BHP at UT). I am familiar with both schools as my sister graduated from Michigan and UT is my state school. The main factors I am considering:-1. Quality of education (business and fields outside of business)-2. Tuition -3. Overall vibe . . I am very much aware that both institutions are very well established will provide me with a great education. Getting accepted into both schools is a dream come true for me. How much better is a Michigan education vs UT? UT has more ""prestige"" where I live (Texas) however how does it compare to Michigan on a national level. I do not plan on staying in Texas. Also, how big of a difference does a class size of 500 ( in Ross) make vs the1200 ( at McCombs)? Is it a factor worth considering? Finally, how easy is it to double major/ minor in fields outside of Business at Michigan? . . I am beyond blessed that affording the out of state tuition at Michigan is a realistic option for my family. My mom has made it clear that my education will be a priority no matter the costs. That said, the difference in tuition is definitely noteworthy. Is it justifiable to spend almost 3x as much for a degree from Ross rather than McCombs when looking at it from a strictly educational/job prospect perspective? Will a degree from Ross open enough opportunities to where the difference in tuition is made up for? . . Finally, I love the vibe of both Michigan and UT. I am concerned about the cold, though. Is the cold weather a factor to consider? Also, I want to be surrounded by a diverse group of students for my four years. Michigan is about 50/50 in-state vs out of state while UT is 90/10.

We already know of cases throughout the US and world, many of which were visited by those returning from Spring Break. We also know social distancing works to dampen the worst of epidemics.. . Michigan can lead as an example of forethought, and actively save lives, with action rather than reaction.. . Thank you,. . \[your name\]. . . . 1.

I am extremely excited to be a Wolverine, but I tried emailing my apparent transfer adviser with questions and got zero new information. Hoping this works better!. . 1.

I don't mind being in a bigger city or anything of the sorts, but coming in after finishing my soph. year might be tough to get a new group of friends, etc. What tips do you have?. 2. Suggestions / tips for off-campus housing? I know basically nothing about the off-campus living scene in Ann Arbor. I'd prefer to live somewhat close to Ross, but I don't even know what area that is considered. I currently pay around $600 for a two-person apartment, but being at GV I know it'll be more expensive at UM. What's a normal price area for rent? What's the deal with these ""high-rise apartments"" I see so many talking about? This is my main area of concern.. 3. Living solo or sharing? I know going solo (I believe they are called studios?) would be more expensive, but how is the experience compared? Did you go in blind with other people and how did it go?. 4. Fraternity life? I'm part of a Fraternity here at GV that also has a chapter at UM. I've heard conflicting reports of how they are over there, but how prominent would you say (Greek-affiliated or not) frat life is? Is it a big deal? I'm considering asking some of their guys if anyone needs one more roommate.. 5. Scholarships? Did you get any, and if so, what were your academics looking like? Where to apply? Is it too late?. 6. Any other tips about being a Wolverine? Anything you can think of would help greatly, transfer or not, especially if you didn't realize them until attending for a bit.

Is it too late?. 6. Any other tips about being a Wolverine? Anything you can think of would help greatly, transfer or not, especially if you didn't realize them until attending for a bit. Best restaurants, parking pass info or bussing, navigating the campus, going to football/basketball games, literally anything!. . Apologies for the overflow, just really confused and excited.

t3_fhfv9z,2020-03-12 12:53:07,Throwback Thursday - How did U-M respond to the 1918 flu pandemic?,"I'm doing something a bit different for today's post instead of the usual picture, I hope folks find this as interesting as I did. No class today so you should have time to read it, right? . . I would like to preface this by saying that I am not trying to make light of yesterday's events and what is happening right now. I hope everyone is taking this situation very seriously and making sure to take care of yourself and others. This is an unprecedented sequence of events in my lifetime and I was interested in getting some historical context for how our campus has been impacted by such events in the past.. . ----------------------------. At the start of this week as I saw peer institutions going online it seemed inevitable that U-M would follow once the state of Michigan had confirmed COVID-19 cases. I wondered about other times that U-M has cancelled class for reasons besides weather (prior to today the last time was on September 11, 2001) and specifically wanting an answer to the question, **""Did U-M cancel classes during the 1918 flu pandemic?"".**. . This led me to several hours of reading through old copies of The Michigan Daily from October and November 1918. If you weren't aware there is a [searchable archive of The Michigan Daily from 1890-present](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily), it is an incredible resource for learning about campus history and the student experience. . . Late 1918 was a chaotic time on campus. Amidst the panic surrounding the spread of the flu, which killed an estimated half a million in the U.S., it was the last days of World War I. U-M was hosting and teaching a detachment of 200 U.S. Army soldiers as part of the [Student Army Training Corps (SATC)](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-87323?view=text), rationing was in place for a number of goods, and students not preparing for service were helping the war effort in a variety of other ways. . . Ann Arbor had relatively few (115 reported) deaths due to the flu but life was significantly impacted for several weeks. [From October 16th through November 7th](https://medicineatmichigan.org/sites/default/files/archives/history_1.pdf) the city of Ann Arbor prohibited meetings in public spaces. Primary and secondary schools in the city were closed. . . Living in very close quarters, the flu unsurprisingly spread among SATC soldiers. The SATC was placed under quarantine in their barracks for several weeks to prevent any further spread of the flu within their ranks, however the virus had already spread extensively. Newberry Hall and the since torn-down [Barbour Gymnasium were temporarily turned into infirmaries](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/91) to house the sick. In total 57 members of the SATC died as a result of the flu or complications from it (often pneumonia). . . [On October 17th 1918](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/77) U-M President Harry Hutchins ordered that all university students and faculty wear face masks, which were distributed by the university, until further notice. A letter from the editor that day also made a plea to students to take things seriously. Science still had a long way to go back then in terms of understanding the spread of disease. We now know that for those that are healthy wearing a mask would not have an impact on preventing the spread of disease. . . **Despite reports each day of new deaths and infections U-M, stubborn as ever, did not cancel classes.** The [October 24th edition of the Daily](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/103) quotes Dr. W. E. Forsythe, Director of UHS, . > ""The faculty has supported the measure well by wearing their masks and by keeping the classrooms supplied with fresh air. It would be perfectly absurd to close school. The students would seize the opportunity to go to their homes, thus spreading the disease...if schools were closed and the students were forced to remain in Ann Arbor they would spend their time in each other's rooms in small crowds or wander the streets, which is worse than staying in well ventilated classrooms"".. . So no, U-M did not cancel classes for one of the deadliest pandemics in history. But that did not stop students from skipping out. On October 24th [there was a report](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/106) noting a spike in student absences, especially in the College of Engineering.

But overall I was quite surprised at how little push back I read about from students. In campus life one of the bigger disruptions was the cancellation of the college football season after just five games. Michigan finished the season 5-0 and would later be declared National Champions.. . As early November continued the number of new cases and deaths in Ann Arbor continued to drop. News focused more and more on the advance of allied forces and some wartime restrictions were starting to be relaxed. On [November 2nd a headline declared ""Ann Arbor Druggists Now Permitted To Sell Dope""](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755693/137).

That day there was also an article lamenting that women were being allowed to enter the Michigan Union. I've read it several times and am genuinely not sure if it is satire or not.

I'm from Massachusetts, so travel-bans related to snowfall and storms are no stranger to me, generally, this would be associated with being pulled over and told to go home immediately if you were caught in the dead of an extreme snowstorm, but this almost never happens. However, a lot of the people close to me are now concerned that I might not be able to make it home in a few weeks, for example, because a travel ban would be put upon the US or Michigan or Massachusetts that forbids me from traveling. Does anyone have any knowledge on this matter, and what the government can legally force me to do/not to do? Surely they can't prevent me something like this, right?",neutral,0.7244585156440735

t3_fkru98,2020-03-18 15:59:41,Rant: The University's reaction to coronavirus disproportionately hurts working-class students and students with bad home environments,"To start I will say that I recognize there is no template solution for responding to Coronavirus. That said, I think the University's solution is not made with certain UM populations in mind.. . **Loss of Part-Time Work:** Many Michigan students work part-time jobs on campus and rely on this either as supplemental income or for their rent and food payments. The latter group has just been upended of their on-campus jobs and is now looking for other ways to pay rent. Some of this group might also be experiencing lay-offs in the family and is frantically searching for part-time work just in order to pay the bills. This requires extraordinary effort and takes time away from learning material. Speaking personally, my family just lost 80% of our income and I no longer have my part-time job. We might have to move - not ideal for classroom success. And I refuse to believe that I am the only one going through this; in fact, I know for a fact that is not true. And sure, in classes that are graded on a curve, myself and others who have to work on campus are already at a disadvantage, but that's life. However, during these special times where this disadvantage is exacerbated, I believe the University should give additional leeway. Allowing Pass/Fail for mandatory classes would be a great start because I don't believe my performance this semester will be representative of my abilities.. . **Lack of Access to School Resources:** Some Michigan students do not have the resources available to them at home to succeed for online classes, be it internet, pencils and paper, or computers. These are integral to the very ability to first learn the material, let alone master it to the level where you could take an exam or write a paper on it. Speaking personally, my family is on a very cheap wifi/cell/etc. plan such that video quality and streaming on my computer are terrible. I cannot load Bluejeans for the life of me and am about 50/50 with Reddit. I do not feel like this is an environment I can succeed in when I can only hear every other word of my live lectures. I get that not everyone is having this problem, but I would encourage the University and its professors to be cognizant of those who have to spend twice as long to get the same material.. . **Upheaval of Living Situation:** This also doesn't apply to me because I was able to leave all my stuff in Ann Arbor, but some of my friends who are freshman or international students have confided in me the insanity and suddenness surrounding their change in living situation. Freshman are being kicked out of their dorms with a day's notice. Some international students had to frantically leave Ann Arbor to get back to family abroad before their home countries closed their borders. One friend in particular found out she only had 16 hours to get back to India before they put into place travel restrictions, and spent that time, naturally, preparing to fly back. This puts an insane amount of stress on students and makes it hard to learn, even with online learning.. . **Bad Home Environments:** This doesn't apply to me personally, but some of my friends literally dreaded going home because of various issues going on at home - abuse, homophobia, etc. Home is not an environment where these students can succeed, and thus, not an environment where they should be graded on curves against peers who might not have these issues.. .

The intent of this post is not to shame people who can learn equally well at home because they have the environment to do so; rather, if any professor or GSI is reading this, I hope that you may better understand where so many students are coming from when they say they are struggling to keep up.. .

To start I will say that I recognize there is no template solution for responding to Coronavirus. That said, I think the University's solution is not made with certain UM populations in mind.. . **Loss of Part-Time Work:** Many Michigan students work part-time jobs on campus and rely on this either as supplemental income or for their rent and food payments. The latter group has just been upended of their on-campus jobs and is now looking for other ways to pay rent. Some of this group might also be experiencing lay-offs in the family and is frantically searching for part-time work just in order to pay the bills. This requires extraordinary effort and takes time away from learning material. Speaking personally, my family just lost 80% of our income and I no longer have my part-time job. We might have to move - not ideal for classroom success. And I refuse to believe that I am the only one going through this; in fact, I know for a fact that is not true. And sure, in classes that are graded on a curve, myself and others who have to work on campus are already at a disadvantage, but that's life. However, during these special times where this disadvantage is exacerbated, I believe the University should give additional leeway. Allowing Pass/Fail for mandatory classes would be a great start because I don't believe my performance this semester will be representative of my abilities.. . **Lack of Access to School Resources:** Some Michigan students do not have the resources available to them at home to succeed for online classes, be it internet, pencils and paper, or computers. These are integral to the very ability to first learn the material, let alone master it to the level where you could take an exam or write a paper on it. Speaking personally, my family is on a very cheap wifi/cell/etc. plan such that video quality and streaming on my computer are terrible. I cannot load Bluejeans for the life of me and am about 50/50 with Reddit. I do not feel like this is an environment I can succeed in when I can only hear every other word of my live lectures. I get that not everyone is having this problem, but I would encourage the University and its professors to be cognizant of those who have to spend twice as long to get the same material.. . **Upheaval of Living Situation:** This also doesn't apply to me because I was able to leave all my stuff in Ann Arbor, but some of my friends who are freshman or international students have confided in me the insanity and suddenness surrounding their change in living situation. Freshman are being kicked out of their dorms with a day's notice. Some international students had to frantically leave Ann Arbor to get back to family abroad before their home countries closed their borders. One friend in particular found out she only had 16 hours to get back to India before they put into place travel restrictions, and spent that time, naturally, preparing to fly back. This puts an insane amount of stress on students and makes it hard to learn, even with online learning.. . **Bad Home Environments:** This doesn't apply to me personally, but some of my friends literally dreaded going home because of various issues going on at home - abuse, homophobia, etc. Home is not an environment where these students can succeed, and thus, not an environment where they should be graded on curves against peers who might not have these issues.. . And I am sure there are many other difficulties that other students are going for the might not be top of mind for me, but are still equally real and equally harmful to students' ability to learn and complete schoolwork.. . The intent of this post is not to shame people who can learn equally well at home because they have the environment to do so; rather, if any professor or GSI is reading this, I hope that you may better understand where so many students are coming from when they say they are struggling to keep up.. .

Arguments against: introduces another level of choice into an already fraught environment and does so around a highly contested topic -- grades; removes the inevitable pressure on instructors to reveal what the underlying grade is so students can decide whether to unmask; makes unmasking a signal (i.e., those who don't unmask must be hiding an inferior performance). I am persuaded that the strategic behavior around unmasking will be difficult for faculty and students -- and when this comes to a head in a few weeks, we will be in a much different phase of the outbreak in the US -- where everyone's resources will be further strained.

Cons:. . * Cold weather (I like to wear shorts). * Might not be a direct program for working in California. * I heard they don't cap certain majors like CS in order to promote diversity, creating crazy waitlist for courses. * Recruiting for summer internships and post-grad jobs likely will be from companies in that area of America (AKA not California). * Lots of in-state kids that may have a different perspective than me. * Different culture (more white) than I'm used to which isn't bad (I'm an Asian male that hangs with Asian males lol). .

UM-Dearborn and UM-Flint have developed commencement plans to honor their graduates, as well.. . . * We will plan to celebrate Class of 2020 graduates this year with online and social media content on the days leading up to our previously scheduled traditional commencement ceremony. This will include special performances and greetings from our central campuses, as well as from several schools, colleges and groups. Graduates will have the opportunity to provide content, and we invite you to submit photos, videos, and quotes that capture your experience as a Wolverine. I'll be posting my address to graduates on the morning of May 2. This won't be an online ""commencement ceremony"" and will not follow any strict schedule. Rather, it's a way to mark the day while allowing you to enjoy this content on your own schedule.. . . * We are waiving the previous $5 fee for graduates wishing to obtain a digital diploma. This waiver currently applies to most of our programs, and we're working to implement it university-wide for May 2020 grads. We'll share further information when details are finalized.",neutral,0.7228211760520935

t3_g4wi33,2020-04-20 16:56:00,Thoughts on Schlissel's latest email?,"Dear Colleagues:. . The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected all members of the University of Michigan community, creating personal difficulties and adding fear and uncertainty to our lives. Some of us are living apart from our families to protect their health. Others must simultaneously juggle the needs of remote work and schooling for our children. Simple comforts like strolls through our museums, being captivated by live performances, and having friends over for a meal are now unsafe.. . The pandemic also has threatened the financial stability and future strength of our university.. . I first want to express my gratitude to all of you for your willingness to adjust quickly to the demands we face. We've had to move rapidly to a new way of life and work - all while striving to deliver the critical parts of our mission and serve our students and the public through education, research and patient care.. . We are striving to protect employees' jobs as much as possible even as the pandemic, and society's response to it, continues to evolve. Special banks of paid time off and a commitment to paying faculty and staff through April have helped us to weather the initial stages of the pandemic and maintain as many aspects of normal life as possible for employees.. . But we also know that the future will not return to what we knew as ""normal,"" at least not immediately and perhaps for much longer. I've previously mentioned the uncertainties we face from the pandemic. Like everyone across our nation, we don't know how long it will last, nor can we precisely predict what the short- and long-term financial effects will be although recent indications are of grave concern.. . These uncertainties continue to impose a set of very real challenges on the university. Virtually all sources of revenue the university relies on for daily operations are in question. At the same time, we are managing new costs that arose quickly. Our best estimate is that the university, including all three campuses and Michigan Medicine, currently faces anticipated losses of $400 million to $1 billion through the end of the calendar year.. . I am writing today to announce several actions the University of Michigan is taking in our continuing efforts to address the financial gap and other evolving challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with sharing the principles we will continue to use as we work through the difficult times ahead.. . **Principles**. . In this time of mounting uncertainty, it is important that we have clear principles that will guide difficult decisions in the months to come. There is still so much we don't know, but I want to be clear that there are values of which we can be certain.. . The University of Michigan is an institution that has stood the test of time for more than 200 years. While it will not be easy, U-M will overcome this pandemic, and we will - as we always have - uphold our public mission and the promise we have made to those we serve.. . These principles were developed in conjunction with the executive team and key senior leaders to align with U-M's core values. They will help us to remain true to ourselves and to our mission as we confront the difficulties ahead. The principles are:. . * **Deliver the mission of the University of Michigan.** We take pride in the work we are doing to enhance society and recognize the many communities who rely on us.. * **Value, protect and support our people.** We will seek and implement the best guidance possible for the health and safety of our students and employees. We will also prioritize students' academic progress and financial aid and strive to minimize adverse impacts on regular employees. The success and well-being of all members of our community are crucial to education, research and patient care at U-M, now and into the future.. * **Preserve the University of Michigan's long-term excellence.** We are responsible not just for the university's success today, but for its future. Together, we continue to demonstrate the importance of academic excellence, including the inseparable values of diversity, equity and inclusion. No crisis can change this fundamental truth. We will have to work and think differently to uphold these values.. * **Communicate effectively and thoughtfully with our community.** We will continue to share information with as much transparency and as quickly as we can on our COVID-19 website and in communications with individual units.. . **Actions to preserve financial resources**. . We must work to preserve financial resources wherever we can. Some of the actions below are amplifications of previously announced plans, or they draw a clearer line for how we will proceed in the coming months. These actions apply to all three campuses and Michigan Medicine.. . **Elimination of non-essential expenditures.** All non-essential expenditures - for example travel, conferences, use of consultants - are to be suspended and new financial commitments are to be avoided until further notice. Research projects that are fully funded by federal sponsors can continue operations and spending as needed. More information including guidance on other sponsored funding can be found on the [COVID-19 research operations page](https://research.umich.edu/covid-19/covid-19-research-operations).. . **Hiring freeze.** All hiring is frozen with the possible exception of staff or faculty in roles considered critical and those fully funded by federal grants. Units may still hire student employees as appropriate. The university will honor its outstanding offers extended to staff or faculty. Michigan Medicine will continue to apply its own criteria based on patient-care needs. This includes temporary staff positions. . . **Salary freeze.** There will be no increases to base salary effective immediately and through the end of the upcoming budget year, including merit increases with the exception of those related to faculty and staff promotions that have already been approved, are part of the faculty tenure and promotion process, or are contractual adjustments prescribed by collective bargaining agreements.. . **Leadership salary reductions.** I have decided to cut my own monthly salary by 10 percent starting May 1 through the end of this calendar year. For the same period, the Dearborn and Flint chancellors have volunteered to reduce their salaries by 10 percent, and the remaining executive officers, chief diversity officer, and athletic director have volunteered to reduce their salaries by 5 percent. This is in addition to the same provisions for no merit increases that I've announced for all employees.. . **Voluntary staff furloughs and reduced hours.** U-M is temporarily implementing two voluntary programs for regular staff in non-critical operations. With unit approval, staff may temporarily leave their position (unpaid furlough) during the COVID-19 pandemic or temporarily reduce their work hours. In both cases, employees would be able to return to their regular positions and hours at the end of the approved period, which can range from 60 to 120 days. Employees approved for furloughs would be eligible to file for unemployment compensation during the period of absence. The university premium portion of insured benefit plans (health, dental, long-term disability, life) will continue to be paid by the unit, and the employee contribution for health plan coverage will be waived during a furlough. Benefits for employees approved for reduced hours would depend on the resulting percentage of effort.. . More details on the voluntary furlough and reduced hours programs are available [here](https://coronavirus.umich.edu/finances/).. . **Postponement of construction projects.** In accordance with Governor Whitmer's directive, contractors have paused construction on campus. We will reevaluate our financial ability in deciding when to resume projects already in construction and how long to delay projects that are proposed for design.. . All of these actions may be reconsidered as financial conditions change. Additionally, the pandemic may require us to make even more difficult decisions in the future, including employee compensation cuts, mandatory furloughs and layoffs.. . Some have suggested that we mitigate the consequences of our financial challenges by drawing down our endowment. Like many personal investments, our university endowment has suffered large but uncertain losses. Nonetheless, it continues to be an essential resource for funding student scholarships on our three campuses, supporting critical medical research and other costs that ensure success of programs across the university. It provides the support necessary to ensure we can deliver on our longstanding commitment as a public university to keep quality education affordable, and hundreds of units rely on the stability it provides through ongoing funding streams. Much of our endowment supports funds that can be used only for a specific purpose. We are committed to honoring these agreements with our donors and to maintaining the endowment's ability to support scholarships, important programs and the long-term stability of the university.. . We know there will be questions for how the current actions affect specific units. We'll share more guidance with managers, and additional information can be found [here](https://coronavirus.umich.edu/finances/).. . **Continuing financial uncertainties**. . The actions I've mentioned are the result of two primary factors: All of the university's major sources of revenue are in question, and we have incurred large, sudden, and unexpected costs due to the pandemic.. . The expenses include the pandemic response at our hospitals and clinics, coupled with the loss of revenue from non-urgent medical procedures and outpatient clinics. We also issued refunds for employee parking and rebates for student housing and dining. These were the right thing to do to support our community, but were not part of our normal budget or monthly cash flow calculations. Additionally, the need for financial aid will likely increase as the families of many of our students have experienced reductions in income.. . In terms of revenue, we face uncertainties around demand for classes (spring, summer and perhaps next fall), our ability to safely bring students to campus, the nationwide economic slowdown, potentially greater needs for patient care, and levels of state support and federal research funding that may decrease significantly.. . We're constantly evaluating the conditions and doing our best to perform the complex analysis of all the factors we must consider. As I noted last week, the evolving COVID-19 situation for U-M continues to call for more change. The current estimated anticipated losses of $400 million to $1 billion for the rest of the calendar year may change as well.. . In the months ahead, we may have to take additional measures to address growing consequences of the pandemic. For instance, work that is available now under the current conditions may not be available in future months. We also must keep in mind the operational and resource needs when we are able to ramp back up. This will depend on state orders and federal guidelines, and it's important to note that it won't be like flipping a switch.. . We're already working to plan for a more gradual return to normal activity, informed by strong public health guidance. I remain cautiously optimistic that we will be able to deliver a public health-informed Fall semester on our three campuses.. . In line with that fourth value expressed above - ""communicate effectively and thoughtfully with our community"" - I want you to know that I pledge to be as proactive as possible with sharing information about any changes that affect us going forward.. . We are being challenged at levels never before seen, but I remain confident in our ability to respond with creativity and a shared commitment to our university's mission and to one another. Please stay healthy and safe, and thank you for making this university so great.. . Sincerely,. . Mark S. Schlissel, M.D., Ph.D.President. . \------. .

We will have to work and think differently to uphold these values.. * **Communicate effectively and thoughtfully with our community.** We will continue to share information with as much transparency and as quickly as we can on our COVID-19 website and in communications with individual units.. . **Actions to preserve financial resources**. . We must work to preserve financial resources wherever we can. Some of the actions below are amplifications of previously announced plans, or they draw a clearer line for how we will proceed in the coming months. These actions apply to all three campuses and Michigan Medicine.. . **Elimination of non-essential expenditures.** All non-essential expenditures - for example travel, conferences, use of consultants - are to be suspended and new financial commitments are to be avoided until further notice. Research projects that are fully funded by federal sponsors can continue operations and spending as needed. More information including guidance on other sponsored funding can be found on the [COVID-19 research operations page](https://research.umich.edu/covid-19/covid-19-research-operations).. . **Hiring freeze.** All hiring is frozen with the possible exception of staff or faculty in roles considered critical and those fully funded by federal grants. Units may still hire student employees as appropriate. The university will honor its outstanding offers extended to staff or faculty. Michigan Medicine will continue to apply its own criteria based on patient-care needs. This includes temporary staff positions. . . **Salary freeze.** There will be no increases to base salary effective immediately and through the end of the upcoming budget year, including merit increases with the exception of those related to faculty and staff promotions that have already been approved, are part of the faculty tenure and promotion process, or are contractual adjustments prescribed by collective bargaining agreements.. . **Leadership salary reductions.** I have decided to cut my own monthly salary by 10 percent starting May 1 through the end of this calendar year. For the same period, the Dearborn and Flint chancellors have volunteered to reduce their salaries by 10 percent, and the remaining executive officers, chief diversity officer, and athletic director have volunteered to reduce their salaries by 5 percent. This is in addition to the same provisions for no merit increases that I've announced for all employees.. . **Voluntary staff furloughs and reduced hours.** U-M is temporarily implementing two voluntary programs for regular staff in non-critical operations. With unit approval, staff may temporarily leave their position (unpaid furlough) during the COVID-19 pandemic or temporarily reduce their work hours. In both cases, employees would be able to return to their regular positions and hours at the end of the approved period, which can range from 60 to 120 days. Employees approved for furloughs would be eligible to file for unemployment compensation during the period of absence. The university premium portion of insured benefit plans (health, dental, long-term disability, life) will continue to be paid by the unit, and the employee contribution for health plan coverage will be waived during a furlough. Benefits for employees approved for reduced hours would depend on the resulting percentage of effort.. . More details on the voluntary furlough and reduced hours programs are available [here](https://coronavirus.umich.edu/finances/).. . **Postponement of construction projects.** In accordance with Governor Whitmer's directive, contractors have paused construction on campus. We will reevaluate our financial ability in deciding when to resume projects already in construction and how long to delay projects that are proposed for design.. . All of these actions may be reconsidered as financial conditions change. Additionally, the pandemic may require us to make even more difficult decisions in the future, including employee compensation cuts, mandatory furloughs and layoffs.. . Some have suggested that we mitigate the consequences of our financial challenges by drawing down our endowment. Like many personal investments, our university endowment has suffered large but uncertain losses. Nonetheless, it continues to be an essential resource for funding student scholarships on our three campuses, supporting critical medical research and other costs that ensure success of programs across the university. It provides the support necessary to ensure we can deliver on our longstanding commitment as a public university to keep quality education affordable, and hundreds of units rely on the stability it provides through ongoing funding streams. Much of our endowment supports funds that can be used only for a specific purpose. We are committed to honoring these agreements with our donors and to maintaining the endowment's ability to support scholarships, important programs and the long-term stability of the university.. . We know there will be questions for how the current actions affect specific units. We'll share more guidance with managers, and additional information can be found [here](https://coronavirus.umich.edu/finances/).. . **Continuing financial uncertainties**. . The actions I've mentioned are the result of two primary factors: All of the university's major sources of revenue are in question, and we have incurred large, sudden, and unexpected costs due to the pandemic.. . The expenses include the pandemic response at our hospitals and clinics, coupled with the loss of revenue from non-urgent medical procedures and outpatient clinics. We also issued refunds for employee parking and rebates for student housing and dining. These were the right thing to do to support our community, but were not part of our normal budget or monthly cash flow calculations. Additionally, the need for financial aid will likely increase as the families of many of our students have experienced reductions in income.. . In terms of revenue, we face uncertainties around demand for classes (spring, summer and perhaps next fall), our ability to safely bring students to campus, the nationwide economic slowdown, potentially greater needs for patient care, and levels of state support and federal research funding that may decrease significantly.. . We're constantly evaluating the conditions and doing our best to perform the complex analysis of all the factors we must consider. As I noted last week, the evolving COVID-19 situation for U-M continues to call for more change. The current estimated anticipated losses of $400 million to $1 billion for the rest of the calendar year may change as well.. . In the months ahead, we may have to take additional measures to address growing consequences of the pandemic. For instance, work that is available now under the current conditions may not be available in future months. We also must keep in mind the operational and resource needs when we are able to ramp back up. This will depend on state orders and federal guidelines, and it's important to note that it won't be like flipping a switch.. . We're already working to plan for a more gradual return to normal activity, informed by strong public health guidance. I remain cautiously optimistic that we will be able to deliver a public health-informed Fall semester on our three campuses.. . In line with that fourth value expressed above - ""communicate effectively and thoughtfully with our community"" - I want you to know that I pledge to be as proactive as possible with sharing information about any changes that affect us going forward.. . We are being challenged at levels never before seen, but I remain confident in our ability to respond with creativity and a shared commitment to our university's mission and to one another. Please stay healthy and safe, and thank you for making this university so great.. . Sincerely,. . Mark S. Schlissel, M.D., Ph.D.President. . \------. .

I would really love to attend the University of Michigan but I don't think I can afford to with the financial aid package that I received. I applied Early Action, got deferred and waitlisted, and then I was admitted on March 27th, 4 days before the deadline for the CSS profile. I submitted the FAFSA on the first day that it was released because I was still living with my parents back then, but I have been practically homeless and couch surfing since December 2019, so getting the documents from them to complete the CSS profile along with their tax returns, W-2s, etc was really difficult. Not only because they're busy with work and their other kids and have never treated me like a priority, but also because of the current pandemic. I don't think most colleges use the CSS profile, and my counselor never mentioned it to me. So I know this is dumb but I had no idea about it until I was accepted. It was already a week past the deadline before my parents got the documents to me and I could submit it.. . Because of this, I have been told that I don't qualify for the Go Blue Guarantee that grants full tuition to students whose families make less than $65,000/year. My parents make well under that and so I've been counting on this grant in order to attend. Especially since my parents have told me they won't cosign on a private loan or help me pay for any of my tuition, food, transportation, etc. I emailed the financial aid office and was told I should have filled it out before I knew I was accepted but I haven't even been living with or relying on my parents for months now. I didn't have access to anything I needed to fill it out. Right now, I'm staying with my AP Literature teacher and she's paid for my enrollment deposit to the University of Michigan.. . I know that it's my fault I didn't fill out the CSS before the deadline while I was still at my parent's house and had access to the documents I needed.

I just want to know if I have a leg to stand on. Is there any possible way to appeal this? Or should I just cut my losses and attend Michigan State University? Because they gave me a slightly better package that seems more manageable for me. But U of M is definitely my first choice so this is really stressing me out.

However, once I got in I've started to develop some concerns over social scene and general culture of the school after reading stuff online.. . So I didn't realize this until going into college Facebook chats, but I'm more of an abnormality than what I experienced in high school. . . To some me up myself: I'm a academic heavy guy(going to study CS), who is also very much into sports(mvp of my basketball team...etc), extrovert, but not really a true partier. So I'm definitely not down to go through some hazing just to be with a bunch of dudes who just want to party and drink.. . Where I'm getting worried is that I'm not sure what my lifestyle(especially freshman/sophomore year) will look like if I don't rush. My main concerns are:. 1. I might not find as many guys who are into the things I'm into. As literally every guy who I share anything in common with wants to rush.. 2. I won't be able to get into any parties. Which would be nice to go every once and a while it is college after all. Like in high school I would get invited to plenty of parties, I went to a few, but was always much more focused on school stuff. Given how hard it is for guys to get in parties, I'm not sure this every once in a while attitude will cut it. Also this is unrelated but considering how rarely I care to go to parties. If I brought a respectable group of girls w me, could I just buy my way into a party?. 3. My third concern might not be able to get as many girls. While I wasn't some crazy chick magnet in HS, I feel like I did pretty well. But considering 25% of Michigan girls are in sororities, i feel like this could be highly problematic. Similar to the guys, every good looking girl(inclusive of the ones I dated in HS) on the fb wants to rush. Even the ones doing CS :(.

I will probably get the shit roasted outta me for this, but I just wanted to put my feelings out there.. . Since my freshman year, I've seen this beautiful girl around campus and I've had a few classes with her and thought she was super cute and always considered making a move, but was always waaayyyy too shy to approach her. Rarely partied during freshman year, but always managed to spot her and her friends at the parties I was at.

I doubt that she even has the slightest idea of who I am, let alone has noticed me at all. Truth is, I would simp for her so hard on any day of the week and I'm pretty sure that she doesn't even have a clue that I exist. I'm lonely as hell and quarantine is making it way worse than it needs to be. On top of this, no one really knows for sure if Fall 2020 is going to be online or if we can come back to Ann Arbor so I don't even know if I will be able to see her ever again and its making me really sad for some reason.

t3_gcyvsa,2020-05-03 21:43:54,For those who are struggling: How I nearly got kicked out of the university but ultimately turned my life around and graduated,"Hola, amigos! Congratulations on finishing this semester; I can't imagine how stressful it must have been for you.. . It's been a little over a year since I've graduated (December 2018), and since this lockdown's been in place, I've done a bit of reflection on my time at Michigan. In my time in AA, I hit rock bottom, and I had to completely rebuild my life before I began to find success. I'm sharing my story because I hope it can prove helpful for some.. . When I moved to Ann Arbor as a freshman in 2012 (I'm dating myself!), anyone might be forgiven if they glanced at my high school resume and pegged me for success:. . \- 3.79 GPA, unweighted . \- 16 AP credits (including taking the AP English test but not the class; my hs only offered 5 AP courses total) . \- 5 community college courses taken . \- Multiple scholarships . \- 35 on the ACT (scored a 28 in 8th grade, the only other time I took it) . \- 99th percentile on Math and Chemistry placement tests. . I realize that these numbers are pretty pedestrian for a place like Michigan, but they serve to emphasize my point. I was a paper tiger coming out of high school, and I was subsequently exposed.. . You know what my GPA was as a freshman? 1.42. I ""earned"" a 1.00 during the Winter semester. Between both semesters, I only passed 11 credits.. . You know what's funny, though? I was *so close* to doing decently, in retrospect. But I pretty much completely gave up in early November, and that was that. I had a B in Physics 140 at that point, which subsequently tanked (I missed passing by 0.2%). I earned an A on the first two ENGR 101 projects...then just never completed another project again. For weeks at a time during the Winter semester, I literally wouldn't even leave Bursley besides the occasional foray to the NCRB. I didn't attend class. I spent 14 hours a day surfing the internet in my dorm room. It got really bad. I made, like, one *kind of* friend the whole year.. . **Some relevant factors which contributed to my struggles as a freshman, roughly ranked from less to more important:**. . \- I had my parents take me home every other weekend (hometown's 75 miles west). **Do not do this**. Cut the cord. Learn to live on your own. . \- My dog became paralyzed in the fall . \- My grandfather passed away in November . \- I began to deeply question my inherited religious beliefs (I was raised in an extremely religious household, so they were very important to me) . \- I had no plan. I didn't know what I wanted out of college. I only went to Michigan because I had told myself my entire life that I would do so. . \- I failed to responsibly regulate my internet usage, as mentioned above. I literally ate, slept, and surfed the internet for large swaths of the year. . \- I had **no study skills whatsoever** . \- I was so afraid of failing that I couldn't bring myself to try. At anything. **I didn't know how to handle adversity**. I spent most of my life before college achieving supposed ""academic success"" without exerting any effort at all. What if I actually *tried* to do well and didn't? That would threaten my pride and my personal identity!. . I wish I could say that I learned my lesson, came back my sophomore year as a new person, and never looked back. Obviously, I didn't. My life got worse before it got better. I'm going to briefly sketch my subsequent journey from here on out, **but feel free to skim until the end if you don't want to get lost in the minutia of my journey.**. . I moved home and took community college classes in Fall 2013. Took 5 classes and ""earned"" a 3.7 despite literally doing nothing different from my freshman year at UMich. That's community college for you. But I bottomed out again in Winter 2014. I once again gave up on my classes halfway through the semester. *And I would've passed them all if I'd just persisted and shown up to class!!*. . I'm not going to take a deep dive into every subsequent semester. I wish I could point to a specific inflection point where I turned everything around, but the truth is, it was a long, slow road, with lots of setbacks along the way. During my two years away from UMich, I realized I had become an atheist (a *huge* deal for me, extremely upsetting,and I literally couldn't bring myself to talk with anyone I knew about it for *years* out of shame) and subsequently lost a chance to date an amazing girl from my high school due to said loss of faith. These are important life factors to mention, because they profoundly affected my psyche for years to come.. . I eventually decided to apply for reinstatement at Michigan for Fall 2015. What should've been my senior year had become my sophomore year. I was on probation, and if I didn't pass every class, I would possibly be expelled from the university. I wish I could say I killed it, but honestly? The only major difference between this semester and my first two at UMich: I actually kept going to class every day. That still qualifies as progress. I still only ""earned"" about 20% of the homework points in ChE 230, and I passed Orgo I with a B despite only cramming for about 2 hours the night before each exam. Ended with a 2.9, and received the chance to continue for another semester.. . Winter 2016 really tested me. I should've been able to build on the last semester, right? But I didn't even complete a single homework assignment for either of my ChE courses before Spring Break. My Thermo midterm grade reflected this. You know what, though? I couldn't drop the classes because I was still on probation. So I met with my professors, regularly met with my adviser (if you were in ChE, you know how awesome Dr. M is), kept attending class, and showed enough during the second half of the semester to pass all of my classes. Barely. To be completely honest, I think Thermo's the one class in my time at Michigan that I didn't really deserve to pass. I suspect the professor passed me because I met with him a few times, showed at least some improvement, and starting turning in (most) of the homework assignments. I owe him big-time. I earned a 2.5, and finally got off probation.. . I told you things would get worse, didn't I?. . The Fall 2017 semester began in much the same manner as the prior semester: I didn't attempt a single homework assignment for any of my courses before Fall break. I distinctly recall sitting in Chrysler auditorium during my Heat/Mass midterm and feeling genuinely suicidal for the first time in my life. I vividly remember staring at the whiteboard and imagining driving myself off a bridge instead of driving home for break. I didn't know how to do a single problem on the test, and my resultant 17/100 (lowest score by far in the class) reflected this. But once again, rather than give up on the semester, I kept trying. This time, though, I didn't pass two of my courses. And thus I was once again placed on probation, and relegated to mandatory academic leave for a semester. I also lost financial aid eligibility, a major blow.. . Winter 2017 proved to be arguably the uttermost nadir of my life. I wasn't taking classes, I wasn't working, I was staying up until 6:00 am every night and sleeping until 2:00 pm, I had ceased going to the gym, and I hadn't told anyone that I was on probation. I pretty much drifted listlessly for about a month. But I began to slowly make better choices. I eventually signed up for a single transferable Microbiology course at WCC about three weeks into the semester. Still struggled to study, but I passed. Then I took Orgo II at WCC during the summer semester. Met a great professor who did his Master's as a ChE at UMich, and I keep in touch with him to this day. Finally applied for a job, at Kroger, and started in July. The Scholastic Standing Committee reinstated me for one final last-chance semester in the Fall.. . Fall 2017 was when my life really began to gain some momentum. I worked 12-20 hours per week, but paradoxically, this forced me to actually become more efficient when I wasn't working. Came down to finals, but I passed all of my classes with a 2.45 overall. Then I earned a 2.82 in the Winter semester (despite a D in a 1-credit 5-week quantum chem course; courses weighted for hw assignments to comprise 30% of your final grade really weren't made for me). And I finally really started to come into my own for my final semester, during Fall 2018. Despite working up to 20 hours a week, and sometimes working 3 am to 11 am on weekends (with a football game in the middle!), I ended up with a 3.2 overall and two A's in my ChE courses. I'm happy to report that I took on a bit of an informal co-leadership role in my senior design team, and I pretty regularly received quality peer reviews in my project-based courses near the end. It took a long time, but I finally looked like I belonged at Michigan.. . Even though it took 6.5 years, I finally did it! I *graduated!!*. . **Here were the primary factors which eventually contributed to my later successes:**. . \- I showed up and kept going to class. Seriously, don't underrate this factor in success; it's a cliche for a reason. . \- I found people to hold me accountable. My adviser in the ChE program proved instrumental in my journey. For most of my later years at UMich, we met pretty much every other week to track my progress. . \- I filled my schedule, which forced me to be more productive in my free time. During my last three semesters in which I worked anywhere from 16-24 hours/week, my overall GPA was a 2.82. Not at all noteworthy, but I don't think it's coincidental, either. . \- I attended office hours and befriended professors. Turns out, people here actually *want* you to be successful, especially if they get to know you a little bit as a person. . \- I began to take more group-based upper-level courses in my last few semesters. Honestly, it's amazing how being responsible for other people's successes can motivate you. I didn't want to let my partners down.. . Again, I don't want to portray my successes as more resounding than they actually were. Even in my last semester, I earned 46% of the homework points in my last lecture-based ChE course. A personal record, unfortunately. Sadly, I could pretty routinely cram for any exam for 2-3 hours beforehand without doing much of any homework, and then score roughly class average. I'm not proud, but that ability did save me a few times. Fall 2017, for example: I stayed up the entire night before my 8:00 am Reactions Engineering final, with the intent to study. I just browsed Reddit all night instead. Still scored 2 points above class average. Then walked into my Heat/Mass final two days afterward, 5 minutes late. I'd crammed for 30 minutes to make a hasty cheat sheet, and that was it. Scored a 48, thought I failed. Then learned that the class average was a 46, and the high score was a 72. . . **Please do not do this, even if you're capable**. It's extremely stressful, and honestly pretty much sucks. When I graduated, I calculated what my GPA would have been if I'd merely performed at class average on hw assignments, ceteris paribus...it wasn't pretty. I would've been dean's list a few times and pretty much broken a 3.0 overall. Not a good realization. Don't be me.. . **Insofar as I'm qualified to give advice, here's mine**. . \- **Lay down your pride.** You're not that smart compared to your peers at Michigan. You might be a 99th percentile kid by many high school metrics, but so is literally everyone else in your classes. . \- **If you don't have any study skills, learn them ASAP.** You might have been able to coast by in high school. Unless you're genuinely an exception, you can't get away with that anymore. Yes, I did know some people who could take 20+ EECS credits and 4.0 them without trying, but that's probably not you. . \- **Attend office hours.** Try it at least once for each of your classes. I treated office hours as non-negotiable for my last couple semesters, since I knew I rarely studied on my own. . \- **Learn to ask for help if you need it.** I cannot overstate how genuinely empathetic and caring people can be at this university. Your professors *want* you to succeed. Your advisers *want* you to succeed. Your peers (most of them) *want* you to succeed. Just be honest if you're struggling, and you'd be *shocked* at how understanding people can be. I've been given extensions to assignments, and I've had professors re-weight my grade to help me out. People will fight for you. It's crazy. . \- **Do not pull all-nighters. Ever.** I'm not joking. I've done them, they absolutely suck, and I'm telling you, not a single one of them would have happened had I been responsible and planned ahead on my assignments. And by extension, you really shouldn't need to be putting more than 80 hours/week into school, and even that's extreme. There's more to life than your classes. . \- **Protect your health.** Your physical health informs your mental health. Please, get outside once in a while. Find some sort of exercise that you can commit to. Get adequate and consistent sleep. Don't eat out every meal. . \- **Find a friend group.** I'm not an outgoing or sociable person at all. Never partied. Yet even though I've been an atheist since 2015, I actually regularly attended a weekly Bible study since I returned to Michigan. I made some great friends this way, played on some fun IM teams, and if not for that group, I probably wouldn't have made many other friends. Seriously, there are 20,000+ undergrads. Potential friends are out there. . \- **Be kind to yourself.** It's okay if your time at Michigan isn't a resounding success. It's okay if you change majors. It's okay if you take longer to graduate. It's okay if you retake some classes. Life is long, and if you don't kill it here, you've still got your whole life ahead of you. Make the most of it. . \- **Embrace the possibility of failure**. The only way you can truly fail at Michigan is if you don't try. I learned this the hard way. I realized that my fear of failure constituted my greatest character flaw. And you know what? I decided to make my response to failure my greatest strength. Still a work in progress. (:. . Never give up on yourself. I know what it feels like to lose hope in life, to feel like you're a complete failure. I know what it's like to give in to despair, to feel like no company would ever hire you, like no person would ever date you. It's awful, it really is. I don't wish it on anyone. But there is hope for you, if you're willing to try.. . My greatest accomplishments in life have consistently resulted from disciplined, consistent, applied effort. To wit:. . \- I started lifting about 10 years ago, and now I'm one of the biggest people at the gym. . \- I started writing a poem every single day in 2014, and now I've got 8 self-published volumes to show for it. I even won 2nd prize (and $3000) in a writing competition for UMich engineers last year, and I find that particularly moving, given that most of [said poems](https://studentawards.engin.umich.edu/poetry/winningpoems/) were written during the winter months of 2017, the darkest period of my life. . \- I graduated with a 2.23 GPA from Michigan. Yes, I am *proud* of that number, because I actually fought for it. It means so much to me.. . If I can fail so miserably, so can anyone. But if I can recover from my failures, so can anyone. I really believe that. If you're struggling, please know that you're not alone. You're not a bad person. Michigan is a challenging place.. . I hope my experiences prove helpful to some of you. I certainly don't pretend to have all the answers. If any of you are struggling and need someone to talk with, I'd be happy to dialogue. I'm still in AA, and I still work out at one of the campus gyms (whenever they re-open! Haha). As a direct result of my struggles, I've become very passionate about helping other people. So if you want to talk school, or life, or lifting, or writing, just hit me up. I've been given so much by so many amazingly selfless people throughout my life, and it's the very least I can do to pay it forward and help others. (:. . Best of luck to all of you, and vamos azul!!. . **TL;DR:** I failed spectacularly at UMich, but turned it around. These are the lessons I learned the hard way.. . https://preview.redd.it/bpbhvfy2rlw41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fdc1f4c851f15976faa746e2a6c8a47365bb342",601,"For those who are struggling: How I nearly got kicked out of the university but ultimately turned my life around and graduated.

When I moved to Ann Arbor as a freshman in 2012 (I'm dating myself!), anyone might be forgiven if they glanced at my high school resume and pegged me for success:. . \- 3.79 GPA, unweighted . \- 16 AP credits (including taking the AP English test but not the class; my hs only offered 5 AP courses total) . \- 5 community college courses taken . \- Multiple scholarships . \- 35 on the ACT (scored a 28 in 8th grade, the only other time I took it) . \- 99th percentile on Math and Chemistry placement tests. . I realize that these numbers are pretty pedestrian for a place like Michigan, but they serve to emphasize my point. I was a paper tiger coming out of high school, and I was subsequently exposed.. . You know what my GPA was as a freshman? 1.42. I ""earned"" a 1.00 during the Winter semester. Between both semesters, I only passed 11 credits.. . You know what's funny, though? I was *so close* to doing decently, in retrospect. But I pretty much completely gave up in early November, and that was that. I had a B in Physics 140 at that point, which subsequently tanked (I missed passing by 0.2%). I earned an A on the first two ENGR 101 projects...then just never completed another project again. For weeks at a time during the Winter semester, I literally wouldn't even leave Bursley besides the occasional foray to the NCRB. I didn't attend class. I spent 14 hours a day surfing the internet in my dorm room. It got really bad. I made, like, one *kind of* friend the whole year.. . **Some relevant factors which contributed to my struggles as a freshman, roughly ranked from less to more important:**. . \- I had my parents take me home every other weekend (hometown's 75 miles west). **Do not do this**. Cut the cord. Learn to live on your own. . \- My dog became paralyzed in the fall . \- My grandfather passed away in November . \- I began to deeply question my inherited religious beliefs (I was raised in an extremely religious household, so they were very important to me) . \- I had no plan. I didn't know what I wanted out of college. I only went to Michigan because I had told myself my entire life that I would do so. . \- I failed to responsibly regulate my internet usage, as mentioned above. I literally ate, slept, and surfed the internet for large swaths of the year. . \- I had **no study skills whatsoever** . \- I was so afraid of failing that I couldn't bring myself to try. At anything. **I didn't know how to handle adversity**. I spent most of my life before college achieving supposed ""academic success"" without exerting any effort at all. What if I actually *tried* to do well and didn't? That would threaten my pride and my personal identity!. . I wish I could say that I learned my lesson, came back my sophomore year as a new person, and never looked back. Obviously, I didn't. My life got worse before it got better. I'm going to briefly sketch my subsequent journey from here on out, **but feel free to skim until the end if you don't want to get lost in the minutia of my journey.**. . I moved home and took community college classes in Fall 2013. Took 5 classes and ""earned"" a 3.7 despite literally doing nothing different from my freshman year at UMich. That's community college for you. But I bottomed out again in Winter 2014. I once again gave up on my classes halfway through the semester. *And I would've passed them all if I'd just persisted and shown up to class!!*. . I'm not going to take a deep dive into every subsequent semester. I wish I could point to a specific inflection point where I turned everything around, but the truth is, it was a long, slow road, with lots of setbacks along the way. During my two years away from UMich, I realized I had become an atheist (a *huge* deal for me, extremely upsetting,and I literally couldn't bring myself to talk with anyone I knew about it for *years* out of shame) and subsequently lost a chance to date an amazing girl from my high school due to said loss of faith. These are important life factors to mention, because they profoundly affected my psyche for years to come.. . I eventually decided to apply for reinstatement at Michigan for Fall 2015. What should've been my senior year had become my sophomore year. I was on probation, and if I didn't pass every class, I would possibly be expelled from the university. I wish I could say I killed it, but honestly? The only major difference between this semester and my first two at UMich: I actually kept going to class every day. That still qualifies as progress. I still only ""earned"" about 20% of the homework points in ChE 230, and I passed Orgo I with a B despite only cramming for about 2 hours the night before each exam. Ended with a 2.9, and received the chance to continue for another semester.. . Winter 2016 really tested me. I should've been able to build on the last semester, right? But I didn't even complete a single homework assignment for either of my ChE courses before Spring Break. My Thermo midterm grade reflected this. You know what, though? I couldn't drop the classes because I was still on probation. So I met with my professors, regularly met with my adviser (if you were in ChE, you know how awesome Dr. M is), kept attending class, and showed enough during the second half of the semester to pass all of my classes. Barely. To be completely honest, I think Thermo's the one class in my time at Michigan that I didn't really deserve to pass. I suspect the professor passed me because I met with him a few times, showed at least some improvement, and starting turning in (most) of the homework assignments. I owe him big-time. I earned a 2.5, and finally got off probation.. . I told you things would get worse, didn't I?. . The Fall 2017 semester began in much the same manner as the prior semester: I didn't attempt a single homework assignment for any of my courses before Fall break. I distinctly recall sitting in Chrysler auditorium during my Heat/Mass midterm and feeling genuinely suicidal for the first time in my life. I vividly remember staring at the whiteboard and imagining driving myself off a bridge instead of driving home for break. I didn't know how to do a single problem on the test, and my resultant 17/100 (lowest score by far in the class) reflected this. But once again, rather than give up on the semester, I kept trying. This time, though, I didn't pass two of my courses. And thus I was once again placed on probation, and relegated to mandatory academic leave for a semester. I also lost financial aid eligibility, a major blow.. . Winter 2017 proved to be arguably the uttermost nadir of my life. I wasn't taking classes, I wasn't working, I was staying up until 6:00 am every night and sleeping until 2:00 pm, I had ceased going to the gym, and I hadn't told anyone that I was on probation. I pretty much drifted listlessly for about a month. But I began to slowly make better choices. I eventually signed up for a single transferable Microbiology course at WCC about three weeks into the semester. Still struggled to study, but I passed. Then I took Orgo II at WCC during the summer semester. Met a great professor who did his Master's as a ChE at UMich, and I keep in touch with him to this day. Finally applied for a job, at Kroger, and started in July. The Scholastic Standing Committee reinstated me for one final last-chance semester in the Fall.. . Fall 2017 was when my life really began to gain some momentum. I worked 12-20 hours per week, but paradoxically, this forced me to actually become more efficient when I wasn't working. Came down to finals, but I passed all of my classes with a 2.45 overall. Then I earned a 2.82 in the Winter semester (despite a D in a 1-credit 5-week quantum chem course; courses weighted for hw assignments to comprise 30% of your final grade really weren't made for me). And I finally really started to come into my own for my final semester, during Fall 2018. Despite working up to 20 hours a week, and sometimes working 3 am to 11 am on weekends (with a football game in the middle!), I ended up with a 3.2 overall and two A's in my ChE courses. I'm happy to report that I took on a bit of an informal co-leadership role in my senior design team, and I pretty regularly received quality peer reviews in my project-based courses near the end. It took a long time, but I finally looked like I belonged at Michigan.. . Even though it took 6.5 years, I finally did it! I *graduated!!*. . **Here were the primary factors which eventually contributed to my later successes:**. . \- I showed up and kept going to class. Seriously, don't underrate this factor in success; it's a cliche for a reason. . \- I found people to hold me accountable. My adviser in the ChE program proved instrumental in my journey. For most of my later years at UMich, we met pretty much every other week to track my progress. . \- I filled my schedule, which forced me to be more productive in my free time. During my last three semesters in which I worked anywhere from 16-24 hours/week, my overall GPA was a 2.82. Not at all noteworthy, but I don't think it's coincidental, either. . \- I attended office hours and befriended professors. Turns out, people here actually *want* you to be successful, especially if they get to know you a little bit as a person. . \- I began to take more group-based upper-level courses in my last few semesters. Honestly, it's amazing how being responsible for other people's successes can motivate you. I didn't want to let my partners down.. . Again, I don't want to portray my successes as more resounding than they actually were. Even in my last semester, I earned 46% of the homework points in my last lecture-based ChE course. A personal record, unfortunately. Sadly, I could pretty routinely cram for any exam for 2-3 hours beforehand without doing much of any homework, and then score roughly class average. I'm not proud, but that ability did save me a few times. Fall 2017, for example: I stayed up the entire night before my 8:00 am Reactions Engineering final, with the intent to study. I just browsed Reddit all night instead. Still scored 2 points above class average. Then walked into my Heat/Mass final two days afterward, 5 minutes late. I'd crammed for 30 minutes to make a hasty cheat sheet, and that was it. Scored a 48, thought I failed. Then learned that the class average was a 46, and the high score was a 72. . . **Please do not do this, even if you're capable**. It's extremely stressful, and honestly pretty much sucks. When I graduated, I calculated what my GPA would have been if I'd merely performed at class average on hw assignments, ceteris paribus...it wasn't pretty. I would've been dean's list a few times and pretty much broken a 3.0 overall. Not a good realization. Don't be me.. . **Insofar as I'm qualified to give advice, here's mine**. . \- **Lay down your pride.** You're not that smart compared to your peers at Michigan. You might be a 99th percentile kid by many high school metrics, but so is literally everyone else in your classes. . \- **If you don't have any study skills, learn them ASAP.** You might have been able to coast by in high school. Unless you're genuinely an exception, you can't get away with that anymore. Yes, I did know some people who could take 20+ EECS credits and 4.0 them without trying, but that's probably not you. . \- **Attend office hours.** Try it at least once for each of your classes. I treated office hours as non-negotiable for my last couple semesters, since I knew I rarely studied on my own. . \- **Learn to ask for help if you need it.** I cannot overstate how genuinely empathetic and caring people can be at this university. Your professors *want* you to succeed. Your advisers *want* you to succeed. Your peers (most of them) *want* you to succeed. Just be honest if you're struggling, and you'd be *shocked* at how understanding people can be. I've been given extensions to assignments, and I've had professors re-weight my grade to help me out. People will fight for you. It's crazy. . \- **Do not pull all-nighters. Ever.** I'm not joking. I've done them, they absolutely suck, and I'm telling you, not a single one of them would have happened had I been responsible and planned ahead on my assignments. And by extension, you really shouldn't need to be putting more than 80 hours/week into school, and even that's extreme. There's more to life than your classes. . \- **Protect your health.** Your physical health informs your mental health. Please, get outside once in a while. Find some sort of exercise that you can commit to. Get adequate and consistent sleep. Don't eat out every meal. . \- **Find a friend group.** I'm not an outgoing or sociable person at all. Never partied. Yet even though I've been an atheist since 2015, I actually regularly attended a weekly Bible study since I returned to Michigan. I made some great friends this way, played on some fun IM teams, and if not for that group, I probably wouldn't have made many other friends. Seriously, there are 20,000+ undergrads. Potential friends are out there. . \- **Be kind to yourself.** It's okay if your time at Michigan isn't a resounding success. It's okay if you change majors. It's okay if you take longer to graduate. It's okay if you retake some classes. Life is long, and if you don't kill it here, you've still got your whole life ahead of you. Make the most of it. . \- **Embrace the possibility of failure**. The only way you can truly fail at Michigan is if you don't try. I learned this the hard way. I realized that my fear of failure constituted my greatest character flaw. And you know what? I decided to make my response to failure my greatest strength. Still a work in progress. (:. . Never give up on yourself. I know what it feels like to lose hope in life, to feel like you're a complete failure. I know what it's like to give in to despair, to feel like no company would ever hire you, like no person would ever date you. It's awful, it really is. I don't wish it on anyone. But there is hope for you, if you're willing to try.. . My greatest accomplishments in life have consistently resulted from disciplined, consistent, applied effort. To wit:. . \- I started lifting about 10 years ago, and now I'm one of the biggest people at the gym. . \- I started writing a poem every single day in 2014, and now I've got 8 self-published volumes to show for it. I even won 2nd prize (and $3000) in a writing competition for UMich engineers last year, and I find that particularly moving, given that most of [said poems](https://studentawards.engin.umich.edu/poetry/winningpoems/) were written during the winter months of 2017, the darkest period of my life. . \- I graduated with a 2.23 GPA from Michigan. Yes, I am *proud* of that number, because I actually fought for it. It means so much to me.. . If I can fail so miserably, so can anyone. But if I can recover from my failures, so can anyone. I really believe that. If you're struggling, please know that you're not alone. You're not a bad person. Michigan is a challenging place.. . I hope my experiences prove helpful to some of you. I certainly don't pretend to have all the answers. If any of you are struggling and need someone to talk with, I'd be happy to dialogue. I'm still in AA, and I still work out at one of the campus gyms (whenever they re-open! Haha). As a direct result of my struggles, I've become very passionate about helping other people. So if you want to talk school, or life, or lifting, or writing, just hit me up. I've been given so much by so many amazingly selfless people throughout my life, and it's the very least I can do to pay it forward and help others. (:. . Best of luck to all of you, and vamos azul!!. . **TL;DR:** I failed spectacularly at UMich, but turned it around. These are the lessons I learned the hard way.. . https://preview.redd.it/bpbhvfy2rlw41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fdc1f4c851f15976faa746e2a6c8a47365bb342",error,0.0

t3_gdilvg,2020-05-04 19:45:16,"Help!!! I Got an A- in Orgo, My Life is in Shambles!!!","Freshman Honors Pre-Med student here,. . To preface, I got a 4.44x2j18z02 GPA in high school, so clearly I have a superior intellect and higher standards relative to my fellow students. Because of my superstar academic performance in high school, I thought I was bound to go to med school at Harvard, become a doctor, and maybe even find the cure to cancer.. . Well this semester, tragedy struck, and the potential fallout is unimaginable. As I opened my grade portal last week, I was absolutely horrified to see that I had received an A- in Orgo. How the hell could this have happened? I have literally never gotten below a 4.0 on anything in high school, and college and high school both have 2 syllables in them, so they are basically the same thing, right?. . Now I'm worried that I will never get into med school, because I have an A- in Orgo. I can already see the look of disgust on the admissions officer's face, so I am currently writing to all of the med schools that I plan on applying to and explaining what happened this semester. I was also considering leaving the A- masked, so that I can prevent my GPA from dropping by .0000000000000000000000000000001 points. Do you guys think this is the strategy to take? . . /s if it wasn't obvious. . On a serious note, I think a lot of the pre-med students that have been posting here recently need to re-evaluate their priorities. I won't pretend to be an expert on med school admissions, but I know for a fact that you don't need a 4.0 to go to med school. According to the Princeton Review, The **average GPA for medical school** matriculants in 2017-2018 was a 3.64 science, a 3.79 non-science, and a 3.71 overall. I am not a pre-med student myself, but in my personal experience, the difference in amount of work needed to get a GPA of 4.0 vs 3.7-3.8 is pretty significant (and they are all great GPA's. If you don't think a 3.7 or 3.8 is a good GPA, idk what to tell you). The student that is not gunning for a 4.0 will have more time to do extra curriculars and other activities that can really bolster their applications/resume. On the other hand, a 4.0 doesn't say much about an applicant other than the fact that they can study or do well on exams, which is something that most other applicants can do as well. Do you think you could sit in an interview and hold a meaningful, memorable discussion about your perfect GPA for at least 5-10 minutes? . . I encourage you all to rethink your priorities before it is too late. Being stuck in the 4.0 or bust mindset is in itself unhealthy and the time commitment it requires is not worth it when you could be doing other more beneficial things. . . tldr: you don't need a 4.0 to go to med school",309,"Help!!! I Got an A- in Orgo, My Life is in Shambles!!!. Freshman Honors Pre-Med student here,. . To preface, I got a 4.44x2j18z02 GPA in high school, so clearly I have a superior intellect and higher standards relative to my fellow students. Because of my superstar academic performance in high school, I thought I was bound to go to med school at Harvard, become a doctor, and maybe even find the cure to cancer.. . Well this semester, tragedy struck, and the potential fallout is unimaginable. As I opened my grade portal last week, I was absolutely horrified to see that I had received an A- in Orgo. How the hell could this have happened? I have literally never gotten below a 4.0 on anything in high school, and college and high school both have 2 syllables in them, so they are basically the same thing, right?. . Now I'm worried that I will never get into med school, because I have an A- in Orgo. I can already see the look of disgust on the admissions officer's face, so I am currently writing to all of the med schools that I plan on applying to and explaining what happened this semester. I was also considering leaving the A- masked, so that I can prevent my GPA from dropping by .0000000000000000000000000000001 points.

In the past few months, Michigan Medicine has risen to the many challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has created. This includes all of the tremendous efforts on the front lines, in support roles, and from those working remotely to maintain the safest environment possible for our patients and work force. The collective teamwork and contributions have been nothing short of amazing. . . . As you know, the COVID-19 pandemic has also created significant financial challenges for Michigan Medicine, and another need that required our community to respond. For the end of FY20, we are projecting a loss of $130 - $230M in the health system and a $80 - $100M negative variance in the medical school. We will continue to experience similar losses in FY21 unless we take immediate actions today. . . . Last week we introduced the beginning of our Economic Recovery Plan. Today, I'm sharing with you more details of that plan and what to expect for the next 14 months. The plan goal is to achieve savings of $400 million. It is critically important that everyone understands our current situation and what changes will be occurring over the next few months. . . . There are several updates to the Economic Recovery Plan that reflect new information. Bargained for employees should refer to their contracts regarding the following expense reductions. . . . * Leadership Salary Reductions. In total, I will be taking a 20% salary cut to contribute to expense reductions. I have asked my direct reports, chairs, and other leaders to voluntarily take a 5-15% salary reduction as well. . . . * Salary Freeze. There will be no salary increases in FY21, including the elimination of merit pay. Exceptions to this include bargained-for staff, faculty promotions in process, and staff promotions in process or part of a ""ladder"" track. . . . * Hiring Freeze. Job offers that have already been extended will be honored. Any other exceptions to the hiring freeze will require approval from area's Executive Vice Dean, or from the Dean in the case of faculty hiring. Positions funded by external grants will likely proceed, with approvals. . . . * Attrition, Furloughs and Reductions in Force (RIF). We have identified 300 open positions that will no longer be filled. We need to reduce our work force by an additional 1,400 FTEs, either through furloughs or RIFs. Leaders within the various departments will be developing individual plans to identify non-critical activities and roles. . . . * Retirement Match. We are suspending the FY21 retirement match for faculty and staff of Michigan Medicine, which includes the U-M Medical School. Some exclusions may apply for those faculty and staff who have multiple appointments. Employees can continue to contribute up to 5% to their retirement funds. . . . * PTO Sellback. The PTO sellback program, which would have been available in May, will be placed on hold until further notice. . . . * Tuition Reimbursement. Tuition reimbursement for continuing education will not be provided for FY21. If managerial approval was received before May 1, 2020, tuition may be covered if all requirements are met. . . . * Capital Projects. All projects that are not required for safety or regulatory compliance, including the new inpatient facility, have been paused until further notice. . . . * Emergency Needs Funds. A philanthropic fund to help support employees in need of financial assistance due to the pandemic will be established. Information on how to access this direct financial support will be forthcoming from HR. More information about how to contribute to this fund will be available later today on the COVID-19 Philanthropy page. . . . I know this information is difficult to digest.

t3_geflf1,2020-05-06 07:44:56,Fear of the Wrong Decision,"Hi. I've been thinking about making a post like this for a while now, just now got around to really sorting out my thoughts.. . So, I'm a rising sophomore currently planning on declaring my major in econ. In my first semester I was planning on doing something CS related, got my ass kicked by the college transition and had to drop EECS 183 (I know that probably seems a little pathetic to this reddit's high concentration of CS majors but whatever lol). Still got good grades but was upset about having to change paths. Econ was something I liked and seemed practical, so that became my new plan.. . Jump to this past semester and I feel like I completely wasted it. My confidence took a huge hit after last semester (literally have never hated anything more than college at that point), so I took econ stuff as well as other classes that weren't so much exploratory as they were LSA requirement fillers. I've expressed this to my parents who insist I'm being hard on myself but I still feel like I messed up pretty bad. They said that they just wanted me to use W2020 to get acclimated to being in college but I feel like in doing so I've thrown away 1/8 of college.. . Being at home has made me really think hard about my future and do some serious research regarding careers, job potential, etc. I found a lot of information that seems to be in line with an attitude towards higher ed that has been prevalent for a while now: STEM or die. It's really hard for me shake the notion that unless I'm an engineer, CS major, or physician that my life will be perpetual financial despair. Econ majors seem to have the reputation of being Ross rejects and don't really get the same job opportunities. Even if I wasn't looking to compete with Ross kids for jobs I still feel like econ isn't as strong of a major as I thought, and this really worries me.. . So now here I am, mulling over everything. I think I have the capability to do anything here (pain notwithstanding) but I'm trying to not let my fears decide my fate while also not being too overconfident, a hard line to walk rn. I'm really thinking about trying to transfer into engineering but I have doubts over the feasibility of this i.e. I feel like it's already too late and like I might suck at it. In high school, I had the intent to major in engineering every other school I applied to except Umich and got into each, but I had my doubts over how much I'd actually like it, liked the idea of exploring more options, and thought a UM degree would be pretty powerful so I came here. Now, I'm starting to feel the itch to get back into it.. . I know that UM is a great place and any person with any major has the ability to do well in life. I also know that money is the not key to happiness and I should focus on finding a career that I have a passion for (even though I think I'm the kind of person who only gets passionate about things they've invested a lot into but that's for a diff sub lmao). However, I chose UM because I wanted to move up in life and to be able to make the most of what has been given to me, as I have been fortunate to have parents who really prioritized my education. I'm really worried about finding a job, and I feel like I would be upset later in life if I didn't end up better off than my parents. The time to put in work is now while I'm young and in college, so I should try to focus really hard on finding a good major that fits me well and I can succeed with, imo. Just can't seem to get rid of my gut feeling to get the hell out of LSA, though.. . I recognize that it might seem like I'm coming on here to vent about personal problems and ask for free help -- and perhaps that's exactly what I'm doing -- but I would also really appreciate some input on this and would definitely want to hear if anyone else here has been in a similar situation. This is a behemoth of a post and is definitely the longest thing I've put on reddit, so what I'll leave you with are my main questions: Is it too late to transfer to CoE, assuming I could (I'd need Calc 2, Physics, ENGR 101, and Chem--> taking that in the summer)? If I stick with econ, are the prospects good in terms of employment, career growth, and earning potential (again not trying to seem materialistic I just wanna be stable bro)? How scared should I be of making the wrong decision between these two and completely screwing up college?. . I really truly feel lost about this and I wouldn't be coming to reddit if I didn't think it was necessary, and if you've made it this far thank you so, so much for taking the time to read this.. . edit: not complete; also I wouldn't be in CoE for CS I'd be in it for another discipline, most likely MechE",60,"Fear of the Wrong Decision.

They said that they just wanted me to use W2020 to get acclimated to being in college but I feel like in doing so I've thrown away 1/8 of college.. . Being at home has made me really think hard about my future and do some serious research regarding careers, job potential, etc. I found a lot of information that seems to be in line with an attitude towards higher ed that has been prevalent for a while now: STEM or die. It's really hard for me shake the notion that unless I'm an engineer, CS major, or physician that my life will be perpetual financial despair. Econ majors seem to have the reputation of being Ross rejects and don't really get the same job opportunities. Even if I wasn't looking to compete with Ross kids for jobs I still feel like econ isn't as strong of a major as I thought, and this really worries me.. . So now here I am, mulling over everything. I think I have the capability to do anything here (pain notwithstanding) but I'm trying to not let my fears decide my fate while also not being too overconfident, a hard line to walk rn. I'm really thinking about trying to transfer into engineering but I have doubts over the feasibility of this i.e. I feel like it's already too late and like I might suck at it. In high school, I had the intent to major in engineering every other school I applied to except Umich and got into each, but I had my doubts over how much I'd actually like it, liked the idea of exploring more options, and thought a UM degree would be pretty powerful so I came here. Now, I'm starting to feel the itch to get back into it.. . I know that UM is a great place and any person with any major has the ability to do well in life. I also know that money is the not key to happiness and I should focus on finding a career that I have a passion for (even though I think I'm the kind of person who only gets passionate about things they've invested a lot into but that's for a diff sub lmao). However, I chose UM because I wanted to move up in life and to be able to make the most of what has been given to me, as I have been fortunate to have parents who really prioritized my education. I'm really worried about finding a job, and I feel like I would be upset later in life if I didn't end up better off than my parents. The time to put in work is now while I'm young and in college, so I should try to focus really hard on finding a good major that fits me well and I can succeed with, imo. Just can't seem to get rid of my gut feeling to get the hell out of LSA, though.. . I recognize that it might seem like I'm coming on here to vent about personal problems and ask for free help -- and perhaps that's exactly what I'm doing -- but I would also really appreciate some input on this and would definitely want to hear if anyone else here has been in a similar situation. This is a behemoth of a post and is definitely the longest thing I've put on reddit, so what I'll leave you with are my main questions: Is it too late to transfer to CoE, assuming I could (I'd need Calc 2, Physics, ENGR 101, and Chem--> taking that in the summer)? If I stick with econ, are the prospects good in terms of employment, career growth, and earning potential (again not trying to seem materialistic I just wanna be stable bro)? How scared should I be of making the wrong decision between these two and completely screwing up college?. . I really truly feel lost about this and I wouldn't be coming to reddit if I didn't think it was necessary, and if you've made it this far thank you so, so much for taking the time to read this.. . edit: not complete; also I wouldn't be in CoE for CS I'd be in it for another discipline, most likely MechE",error,0.0

I want to do that for a philosophy class because I feel the chance of getting an A is slim. The instructor recommends that I use the traditional letter grade as my GPA won't be impacted in any way but I am not sure whether a grade like a ""B"" or ""C"" is better than a ""P"" on the transcript.",neutral,0.8649080395698547

Gretchen Whitmer has announced that in-person laboratory research can resume with limitations based on public health guidance.. . As the largest public research university in the nation, this is a significant development for our state and our university as we continue to adapt to the coronavirus pandemic. We're beginning to see how certain activities can resume in a public health-informed manner, while also understanding that work will be very different in the months ahead. Here's what this means for us right now:. . All work that can be done remotely must continue to be done remotely. This includes office and dry lab work.. . Our state remains under the governor's Stay Home, Stay Safe order, but as detailed in her MI Safe Start Plan, various economic and work activities can resume in phases. We are taking a similar approach at U-M, and planning for a safe and gradual return is underway at the university level and in our schools, colleges and units. Initially, we are only bringing back a subset of labs for in-person work.. . In fact, some of the same U-M public health experts who are providing advice at the state level also are helping us formulate guidance for our campuses. This is a complex endeavor for a university as large and diverse as ours, and I appreciate the thoughtful work that is being done to help us all be safe.. . Some in-person research labs and studios will open under strict public health guidelines.. . The Office of the Vice President for Research has been working on plans to ramp up in-person research almost from the moment when we had to suspend it two months ago. This extensive planning has included close collaboration with leaders and investigators in our schools, colleges, institutes and regional campuses.. . They have mapped out a plan, in alignment with state and other public health guidelines, to bring back in-person experimental lab and studio-based research in waves so as to minimize risk. The first pilot wave will involve a few carefully chosen labs, with strict public health guidelines for faculty, staff and graduate students. Guidelines will include such things as monitored entry into buildings, a requirement to wear a face covering and maintaining a low density of people in a lab at any one time. We'll track performance metrics for each wave, and that will determine how and when we open additional labs. Additional details will be sent soon to the research community and published in The University Record.. . Please note that even though individual labs in different buildings will resume operation, this does not mean that everyone in those buildings can return immediately. It's quite the contrary. We still need to manage density of spaces and strictly abide by the best public health practices, including requiring all work to be done remotely that can be done remotely.. . We need your continued cooperation.. . This differential and staggered approach to resumption of activity will be the next great test of our resolve and compassion for one another. Full compliance with state and other public health guidelines will help to ensure that we'll be able to resume more work as quickly and safely as possible. We have to accept this shared responsibility even as different parts of our university resume activity at varying speeds.. . I know this is difficult. We all want to be back to in-person work. I very much miss seeing the vibrancy of campus each day and look forward to being able to walk into the office again. To help us reach the day when we can all be together, shared responsibility is essential, not just for our mission but for each other, our families and our future health.. . While we know that life and work will be not be the same for a long time, I am very optimistic about our future. The planning taking place at all levels is thorough and impressive, and we'll share more information as soon as we can. This includes our preparations for the fall, as we hope to be able to deliver a public health-informed fall semester with in-person instruction on our campuses.. . What's clear right now is that the care we have for our students, faculty, staff, patients, visitors and communities is always at the forefront of our efforts. The immediate future of the University of Michigan will look very different than what we have been accustomed to, but it will continue to be determined by the excellence and hard work of the many people who are devoted to our public mission.

Guidelines will include such things as monitored entry into buildings, a requirement to wear a face covering and maintaining a low density of people in a lab at any one time. We'll track performance metrics for each wave, and that will determine how and when we open additional labs. Additional details will be sent soon to the research community and published in The University Record.. . Please note that even though individual labs in different buildings will resume operation, this does not mean that everyone in those buildings can return immediately. It's quite the contrary. We still need to manage density of spaces and strictly abide by the best public health practices, including requiring all work to be done remotely that can be done remotely.. . We need your continued cooperation.. . This differential and staggered approach to resumption of activity will be the next great test of our resolve and compassion for one another. Full compliance with state and other public health guidelines will help to ensure that we'll be able to resume more work as quickly and safely as possible. We have to accept this shared responsibility even as different parts of our university resume activity at varying speeds.. . I know this is difficult. We all want to be back to in-person work. I very much miss seeing the vibrancy of campus each day and look forward to being able to walk into the office again. To help us reach the day when we can all be together, shared responsibility is essential, not just for our mission but for each other, our families and our future health.. . While we know that life and work will be not be the same for a long time, I am very optimistic about our future. The planning taking place at all levels is thorough and impressive, and we'll share more information as soon as we can. This includes our preparations for the fall, as we hope to be able to deliver a public health-informed fall semester with in-person instruction on our campuses.. . What's clear right now is that the care we have for our students, faculty, staff, patients, visitors and communities is always at the forefront of our efforts. The immediate future of the University of Michigan will look very different than what we have been accustomed to, but it will continue to be determined by the excellence and hard work of the many people who are devoted to our public mission. That's why I am optimistic.. . Thank you, all, for your continued diligence. Stay healthy.. . Sincerely,. . Mark S. Schlissel, M.D., Ph.D.. President",error,0.0

I applied for this school in particular for an admiringly stupid reason that ended up falling through spectacularly, when I got here I quickly realized also that, mayyybee coming here when I felt completely burnt out and tired of trying for little good that came out of my efforts wasn't a good idea. I've been trying to convince myself that ""if I just get through college and do well, I'll be home free!"" I've made such promises to myself before that did not come true, so it's a little hard to keep making such promises. And I don't do well in my classes, I actually failed my CS class (280) not a good sign. Due to burn out / test anxiety. I feel I can problem solve well when my brain is fully functional which is rare cause burn out. I got a C in math 115. for the same combo of reasons. Hoping Honors Calc 2's different format will help me do better lol. . . . Thing is, I might have gotten good grades in my programming CS classes in community college, but a lot of those classes were complete jokes. Projects were just about doing one function each project. Despite having credit for EECS 183, I needed to take it cause 280 downright scared me due to not being adequately prepared. The As I got in many classes took so little effort (C# class was literally just, add an extra line of code to this given file and submit it). Final was about making this huge project we were not properly trained to do. I failed that but because my other stuff was good I got an A in that class. Java classes were about doing fairly simple functions each week. One weird crazy challenging assignment, which I failed and got shamed by teacher for. Midterm / final was ""Answer super specific questions about the Java language despite having not studied it"". Other classes were literally ""Follow this step by step guide to do a thing using the textbook"" tedious but easy as heck.. . . . All of these were the online versions of classes , I'm guessing in person classes were hella different from online and are what Michigan evaluated and judged my success based on. I didn't know Michigan disapproved online classes before applying. This is the heart of why I don't feel I belong here - my grades feel hella inflated and I don't think I really clear the Michigan bar, not even close.. . . . I saw my essay scores for my admission application . They were like, 1.5 or 2 / 5. This makes me really feel like my race (Hispanic) is a huge part of what got me in. That and inflated grades. I haven't seen too many Hispanics on campus, Sorry that that seems harsh on myself but yeah. . . . Also I culturally just don't fit in here. Maybe it's just being a lot older, but I feel like I won't find people who I would get close to because everyone I talk to, I feel this weird barrier of perspective sort of separate us. I can have fun in the anime club but it just feels like I'm sorta separated from them in a hard to explain way. It's not just me going ""Baghh stupid kids"" I see them as equals, but just, time has made them innately unrelatable. Not a fan of sports, luckily doesn't seem to matter here but the ""geek culture here is . . .stressed out EECS kids with little free time, including me lol. Graduates are closer to my age, but graduate life seems so different from undergrads, Not sure how many transfers would be any closer to my age.

Also I like having deep convos but the people I've tried to talk to seem so absorbed in their own opinion, they can't even consider what I'm saying / why. Not trying to change their opinion just want an honest conversation instead of feeling I'm being ""sold"" the ""woke""/ PC opinions without being listened to in return. . And I'm not super in tune with Spanish culture, or interested frankly so it's not as easy as ""Oh just find the other Spanish kids"". .

t3_gr0o95,2020-05-26 16:48:55,A comprehensive review of Fletcher Hall,"So you're living in Fletcher Hall.... . * Don't freak! I did too at first. I scoured the Internet to determine if I was doomed for the entirety of my freshman year or not. There wasn't a lot out there. Good news, I had the *best* time living in Fletch, and hopefully you will too.. * So, location. Fletcher is *extremely* close to the IM building (incredibly convenient!) and the closest dorm to the Big House (also incredibly convenient on game days!) (could not stress that part enough!) and also *really* close to a bus stop. On the downside, Fletcher is relatively far from everything else and basically in a residential neighborhood. You get used to walking for food and plan your days to make this easier; grab food before class and before you head home at the end of the day to minimize trips back and forth. Although it sometimes sucks walking 8-15 minutes no matter the weather to go to class or get food, you'll also adjust to that. Just have your coat ready for the winter. Bonus: walking is good for you. My friends joked that the Fletcher Fifteen was losing weight. Some people loved having a bike, and many learned how to use the bus system (learn to use it, it's not that bad and so helpful!) Because of the location, sometimes we were more prone to buying food. Nearby is Cottage Inn Pizza, Jimmy John's (my love), BTB Burrito, Subway, and more. You'll also have a front row seat to house parties. . * More on food: the closest dining hall is South Quad (and also arguably the best dining hall), but East Quad isn't much further either. South is very large and has tons of options. Figure out the shortcuts (through parking lots and stuff haha) to get to South the quickest way possible.. * The building...the building is undeniably old and not ideal and not the cutest on the inside. It's 3 floors (2 boys and 1 girl), one hall each (with ten rooms and a community bathroom), and a cool basement. Approximately 70 students. No elevator. This wasn't really a huge deal, just annoying for moving in and out. One RA on each floor too. No Community Center or front desk or anything either which means little to no supervision. You'll get your packages at West Quad. Often people would get locked out of the building or their room, so that was sometimes difficult but was never a huge deal for me. Because there is little supervision, campus police aka DPSS were around *a lot*. This led to tons of people I know getting in trouble (not majorly like jail or court but). So, unless you want a fun meeting with housing, keep it quiet and don't get caught breaking the rules. Laundry is in the basement as well as ping pong, a pool table, a living room, kitchen, a few tables, gender neutral bathrooms, stuff like that. Not a glamourous basement, but the memories made down there will never ever be forgotten. Also, computer room and mail room on the first floor. Love the computer room. Big fan of corner rooms too; large and good windows. . * A two-room triple. What's that??? You get two rooms! And a sink! You get to brush your teeth in your room! Yay! Basically you and your two roommates will have one room with your desks, shelves, a coat closet, and room for a futon and ottoman (or even a table if you'd like). The second room has 3 closets, a sink (!!!), and 3 beds. Depending on how you arrange, your dressers could be in either room. Having 2 rooms is so so so nice. You and your roommates will be able to nap, get ready, study etc without completely bothering each other. Plenty of closet and storage space. It's the best set-up and almost everybody agreed on that. The bathrooms aren't pretty but really never bothered me. You get used to them. I never had to wait for a shower or toilet either. No AC :/ also not a huge deal though. . * Noise. Because the building is old it can be noisy. Sometimes people complained in group chats, sometimes RA's would say things, but this was never a huge problem. I'm a light sleeper and I was able to sleep at night and nap during the day. . * Now, the best part and what people seem to stress about the most: friends. Fletcher is small and pretty close-knit. By the end of my time there, I think I basically knew everybody's names. Get out of your room and go meet people! Say hi! Go to the other floors! Hang out in the basement! I was able to meet such amazing, cool people that are my closest friends at Michigan. Most of them I met within my first day there. Note: a lot of these (definitely not all) triples are people that requested each other or were friends from high school or whatever. This didn't really inhibit anybody from making friends though. I *loved* the community!!! For extra involvement, get on hall council! Because the building is so small, this is pretty easy to do. . * How does one have fun at Fletcher? Some of my favorite nights were with my friends in our rooms. But also, there are some frats close by. Any of the frats, bars, etc are walkable if you're willing, but you'll definitely get some added exercise. Definitely didn't stop my friends. House parties are also super nice. I promise you're gonna have tons of fun if that's what you want. I also know people who studied tons. It's possible to do well *and* have fun. . * Is Fletcher better than North? I'd say absolutely yes. Is Fletcher better than living on the Hill? Arguable, but probably depends on the person. Not everyone is going to have a good experience, but it's also what you make of the situation. . * Also, street parking! If you want to have a car, you can try to get a pass for the Fletcher lot right behind the building or utilize the free street parking. This can be difficult at busier times, but it's often available. . * So, yeah. I sobbed when I left. Carve your name into the building. Take tons of pics. It's kinda fun telling people where you live and them having never heard of it. Then you can bring them to the building and win them over (it happened so many times). Make the best of it. Nothing is ever going to be like freshman year again. Watch this video if you need some optimism: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4dMa6vHq7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4dMa6vHq7g). All of my friends loved this video. And the dorms don't look exactly like that anymore. Good luck!!!. .

Big fan of corner rooms too; large and good windows. . * A two-room triple. What's that??? You get two rooms! And a sink! You get to brush your teeth in your room! Yay! Basically you and your two roommates will have one room with your desks, shelves, a coat closet, and room for a futon and ottoman (or even a table if you'd like). The second room has 3 closets, a sink (!!!), and 3 beds. Depending on how you arrange, your dressers could be in either room. Having 2 rooms is so so so nice. You and your roommates will be able to nap, get ready, study etc without completely bothering each other. Plenty of closet and storage space. It's the best set-up and almost everybody agreed on that. The bathrooms aren't pretty but really never bothered me. You get used to them. I never had to wait for a shower or toilet either. No AC :/ also not a huge deal though. . * Noise. Because the building is old it can be noisy. Sometimes people complained in group chats, sometimes RA's would say things, but this was never a huge problem. I'm a light sleeper and I was able to sleep at night and nap during the day. . * Now, the best part and what people seem to stress about the most: friends. Fletcher is small and pretty close-knit. By the end of my time there, I think I basically knew everybody's names. Get out of your room and go meet people! Say hi! Go to the other floors! Hang out in the basement! I was able to meet such amazing, cool people that are my closest friends at Michigan. Most of them I met within my first day there. Note: a lot of these (definitely not all) triples are people that requested each other or were friends from high school or whatever. This didn't really inhibit anybody from making friends though. I *loved* the community!!! For extra involvement, get on hall council! Because the building is so small, this is pretty easy to do. . * How does one have fun at Fletcher? Some of my favorite nights were with my friends in our rooms. But also, there are some frats close by. Any of the frats, bars, etc are walkable if you're willing, but you'll definitely get some added exercise. Definitely didn't stop my friends. House parties are also super nice. I promise you're gonna have tons of fun if that's what you want. I also know people who studied tons. It's possible to do well *and* have fun. . * Is Fletcher better than North? I'd say absolutely yes. Is Fletcher better than living on the Hill? Arguable, but probably depends on the person. Not everyone is going to have a good experience, but it's also what you make of the situation. . * Also, street parking! If you want to have a car, you can try to get a pass for the Fletcher lot right behind the building or utilize the free street parking. This can be difficult at busier times, but it's often available. . * So, yeah. I sobbed when I left. Carve your name into the building. Take tons of pics. It's kinda fun telling people where you live and them having never heard of it. Then you can bring them to the building and win them over (it happened so many times). Make the best of it. Nothing is ever going to be like freshman year again. Watch this video if you need some optimism: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4dMa6vHq7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4dMa6vHq7g). All of my friends loved this video. And the dorms don't look exactly like that anymore. Good luck!!!. .

I don't mean to repeat anything that Mark Schlissel has already said or what's already been posted on this subreddit, but he was able to give some insight as part of a new freshman webinar this morning as to what the fall might look like. . . Basically, the administration is currently looking at whether they can test every student as they enter campus in the fall, which is why the availability of testing is such an important factor in deciding whether to reopen.

What topics and concepts should I be well-familiar with before taking the test to perform my best on it? . . Also, what topics are covered in each semester of Tamil coursework specifically, and what level of comfort is expected with the language after completion of a particular semester? What is the workload like in a Tamil course?. . Sorry if this is a bombardment of questions, I just want to do my best on the test to minimize my workload later. . . I'm a native speaker of Tamil, if that helps. I'm quite good at speaking conversational Tamil, though I do get stuck on certain occasions. I can read and write the script, but I read relatively slowly, and I don't know the formal/written forms of a lot of words that I can speak. I'd appreciate any advice you have for me based on my current skill level in the language.. . One last thing - are there any means by which native language speakers can place out of the language requirement without taking a placement test in their native language? I've heard of some people doing this with European languages, but I don't know if the Asian Languages Department allows this and how I would have to get it done. Any insight on this?. .

Then, the group of protesters marched down State Street, reaching North University before they were **stopped by a different group of protesters, who had blockaded off the street, complete with a very large banner.. . This other group were protesting the death of Aura Rosser who was [killed by Ann Arbor Police in 2014.](https://www.aclumich.org/en/cases/fatal-police-shooting-ann-arbor). . They started with anti-racism chants, which were met with appeal by the larger group of protesters; whom, as an editorial, I believe by-and-large thought this was all ""part of the plan"". . . Then they brought up patriarchy and capitalism, which distanced the opinions of the main body. Members of the main body, myself included, took to the sidewalks to attempt to go around them -- and were physically obstructed by members locking arms and shoving people back.. . I personally pointed out that they were directly infringing my rights, which was not well-received (I was immediately told that I'm ""part of the fucking problem, fuck you""), and pushed onwards.. . The march from that point on, once re-gathered past the blockade, was _very_ peaceful, with the officers present walking and chanting alongside those present. Multiple chants were taken up by the officers; the one exception being an abbreviated ""Fuck Donald Trump"" chant, which had not been raised with the same vigor as the others.. . The protest went down to Hill Street, with police escort blocking off traffic, looped up all the way back to the Diag, where the Aura Rosser protest group were on the stairs. . .

t3_gwp36j,2020-06-04 20:07:55,Twitter accounts exposing sexual assault seem like effort to discredit BLM,"TW: sexual assault/rape. . Okay, so I was prompted to make this post after seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/gwfgbt/this_university_is_a_shitshow_right_now/) by u/a2phrog. A Twitter account, @ AtUmich, was formed within the past day with the purpose of outing rapists/sexual assaulters at the University of Michigan. While that idea sits really fucking badly with me as-is, I got suspicious when I saw an identical account, @ JusticeForSTATE, that was also created about a day ago for Michigan State University. Here are the two issues I have with these accounts:. . 1. While there are white men being posted, the majority of men posted on both accounts are black. Considering the current political climate, an account that was created less than a day ago that is primarily accusing black men seems really fucking suspicious to me. I would not put it past alt-righters to commandeer the extremely sensitive issue of sexual assault and use it as a weapon against black men.. 2. Even if these accounts were created with the purest intentions, they are an unbelievably bad idea. Lack of accountability for sexual assaulters is a serious issue on college campuses, and I agree that we should be working to find solutions, but this is in no way a good solution. While false allegations are quite low (estimated anywhere from [2-10%](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf)), that's when the accuser is NON-anonymously reporting to the POLICE. I think it's fair to say that an anonymous Twitter account is much more likely to receive false allegations, because there are zero consequences for someone who isn't telling the truth. Unless the accused files an actual lawsuit, a false accuser will receive no repercussions at all. It would be so easy for someone with a grudge to try to ruin another person's life.. . For full transparency, I'm a white 19F, so obviously my understanding of issues that affect the black community is not going to be as comprehensive as someone who's a part of that community. If I've got something wrong, please let me know; this situation just sat very, very badly with me, and I want to hear what other people think.. . [AtUmich](https://twitter.com/atumich). . [JusticeForSTATE](https://twitter.com/JusticeForSTATE). . Edit: added link to original post that inspired this one.. . Also, I would recommend reading the comments on that post, because it looks like a whoooole lot of shit went down on the Twitter account within the last hour or so, where they claimed they got hacked (which would put all of the survivors that submitted their stories at risk of being outed), posted the info of someone who was apparently lying bc they got ""proof"" (but like what constitutes proof, and how are they getting proof from ppl who submit initially?), and then made the account protected??

t3_h0ewu6,2020-06-10 16:58:04,Don't force yourself into premed (rant),"Bit of a rant ahead, apologies for that.. . I want to preface this by emphasizing that I am not a pre-med student. I am a biochemistry student with absolutely no interest in med school, but because I spend a lot of time in biology-adjacent classes I interact a lot with the pre-med sphere, and I often see a lot of weird decision-making regarding major/course selection and wanted to mount my internet soapbox to offer some unsolicited advice for incoming freshman with aspirations at medical school:. . First, the beast: the majority of students who declare themselves to be ""pre-med"" students at some point during their undergraduate career do not go to med school. It's probably impossible to know the actual statistics, especially since there is no formalized process for announcing oneself as ""pre-med,"" but I would be very surprised if more than 25% of pre-meds go to med school. A lot of students burn out or change direction. A lot of students don't manage to score well on the MCAT to even be qualified to apply. And even then, only a little over 50% of UMich graduate applicants are actually accepted into med school (which is still 10% above the nat'l avg). I don't want to discourage you; you shouldn't give up on honest MD aspirations before you begin your undergraduate career. What I want to emphasize is that concluding your pre-med journey as something other than a med student is the norm here; if you have a choice between burning out or changing direction, please change direction.. . There are a lot of students who are too inflexible, too deadset on med school in such a way that it results in bad decision-making. The first and most obvious is that a lot of students force themselves into a biology major when they really do not like biology. If you fundamentally dislike your major subject, you should not be pursuing that major. A lot of biology is about committing more information to memory than should be humanly possible; this style of education is not for everyone. If the subject you are attempting to study is not interesting to you, you will not do well, especially in such a competitive field. And as a side note, if you are very good at memorizing a lot of information, please do not use that approach in chemistry courses. There's a certain pride associated with memorization; it's a testament to the Herculean effort you've put in, but I see too many people make the Chem 210/215 sequence harder than it needs to be because their approach is wrong. Chemistry problems are fundamentally just logic puzzles, and the number of students who think they can memorize every Sudoku board in existence is baffling. . . Do not limit your opportunities because of med school requirements. I once had someone tell me verbatim, ""Chem is interesting but I can't take because it'd lower my gpa."" Excuse me, what the fuk? This mindset is such a bizarre contortion of the point of college that I assumed they must be playing 9-dimensional chess. Are you dishing out 25k a year or accumulating a shitload of debt so you can a get a number between 3.5 and 4 instead of getting, like, an education? In the subjects you're legitimately interested in? Learning things that are immediately relevant to your potential future careers? . . My point is this: for all the incoming students declaring themselves to be pre-med, please keep an open mind. Please take a second to honestly evaluate the intensity of your passion for the medical industry, and if being a medical doctor is really right for you. There are so many other pathways through which to make your contribution to medicine; pharmaceutical R&D, med. tool development, infectious disease research just to name a few - you don't need to be a medical doctor. Take a variety of classes in your first semester to explore your options, instead of deciding on your endgame before the opening moves are played; it's old advice and frustrating to hear, but it's said so often because it's good advice. Don't look for the classes that will give you easy As and teach you nothing; you are here to learn things. And if you realize that the pre-med track is not for you, I implore you to switch tracks. As someone taking Biochemistry because they are legitimately fascinated by the field, it hurts my heart when I see people hating chemistry and being miserable in classes because they can't break away from their concerns over their gpa. These things should be exciting, instead of a source of pain, and when I see people actively root against their friends and fellow students I don't really know what to think of where we landed.",216,"Don't force yourself into premed (rant). Bit of a rant ahead, apologies for that.. . I want to preface this by emphasizing that I am not a pre-med student. I am a biochemistry student with absolutely no interest in med school, but because I spend a lot of time in biology-adjacent classes I interact a lot with the pre-med sphere, and I often see a lot of weird decision-making regarding major/course selection and wanted to mount my internet soapbox to offer some unsolicited advice for incoming freshman with aspirations at medical school:. . First, the beast: the majority of students who declare themselves to be ""pre-med"" students at some point during their undergraduate career do not go to med school. It's probably impossible to know the actual statistics, especially since there is no formalized process for announcing oneself as ""pre-med,"" but I would be very surprised if more than 25% of pre-meds go to med school. A lot of students burn out or change direction. A lot of students don't manage to score well on the MCAT to even be qualified to apply. And even then, only a little over 50% of UMich graduate applicants are actually accepted into med school (which is still 10% above the nat'l avg). I don't want to discourage you; you shouldn't give up on honest MD aspirations before you begin your undergraduate career. What I want to emphasize is that concluding your pre-med journey as something other than a med student is the norm here; if you have a choice between burning out or changing direction, please change direction.. . There are a lot of students who are too inflexible, too deadset on med school in such a way that it results in bad decision-making. The first and most obvious is that a lot of students force themselves into a biology major when they really do not like biology. If you fundamentally dislike your major subject, you should not be pursuing that major. A lot of biology is about committing more information to memory than should be humanly possible; this style of education is not for everyone. If the subject you are attempting to study is not interesting to you, you will not do well, especially in such a competitive field. And as a side note, if you are very good at memorizing a lot of information, please do not use that approach in chemistry courses. There's a certain pride associated with memorization; it's a testament to the Herculean effort you've put in, but I see too many people make the Chem 210/215 sequence harder than it needs to be because their approach is wrong. Chemistry problems are fundamentally just logic puzzles, and the number of students who think they can memorize every Sudoku board in existence is baffling. . . Do not limit your opportunities because of med school requirements. I once had someone tell me verbatim, ""Chem is interesting but I can't take because it'd lower my gpa."" Excuse me, what the fuk? This mindset is such a bizarre contortion of the point of college that I assumed they must be playing 9-dimensional chess. Are you dishing out 25k a year or accumulating a shitload of debt so you can a get a number between 3.5 and 4 instead of getting, like, an education? In the subjects you're legitimately interested in? Learning things that are immediately relevant to your potential future careers? . . My point is this: for all the incoming students declaring themselves to be pre-med, please keep an open mind. Please take a second to honestly evaluate the intensity of your passion for the medical industry, and if being a medical doctor is really right for you. There are so many other pathways through which to make your contribution to medicine; pharmaceutical R&D, med. tool development, infectious disease research just to name a few - you don't need to be a medical doctor.
