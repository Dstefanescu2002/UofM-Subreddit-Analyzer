Unfortunately, I recently had to move back to our home town in Colorado, because I was recently widowed. He is struggling hard.

All of his classes or online, and he doesn't live on campus, so he hasn't had to keep up with the covid screening rules in place this year. He called me almost in tears tonight because he tried to go get his gown today, and cannot get into the bookstore because he hasn't had a recent screening.

t3_mznelk,2021-04-27 12:31:55,The beauty of English 125,". . Hey all, I am writing this as a student who has just finished taking an english 125 course. Throughout taking it, I have learned a lot, both regarding myself, and regarding writing as a whole, so I want to post it here to give you all an idea of what one can expect from this course. At the beginning of my time taking english 125, I was an unpolished writer who believed in the strict 5-paragraph essay, and that any deviation from that was incorrect or unnatural. Anything out of the ordinary, whether it be using ""i"" in my papers, or contractions, were simply not going to occur throughout my writing. However, through my time in this course, I have grown a lot as a writer. I am now more able to be flexible and elastic in my papers, and if I feel it will help my writing, I'm happy to use I as much as the ""I"" can see. I especially learned a lot regarding this idea in John Warner's ""*Kill the 5 Paragraph Essay""* (I will include the link to this piece at the end of this post). In my close reading of this text, I felt I became aware of what was most important as a writer, that being to appeal to one's audience. There is a specific example of this in Warner's piece as well, as he explains the importance of his instructor teaching him ""a number of different things, genre awareness, audience, structure and sequencing."" (2) This truly does stand out to me, as in just having a flexible essay structure of our own, it is so much easier to develop our own ideas, and structure our own texts accordingly. I must admit, at the beginning it certainly felt like I was handling a bunch of stray ideas, with no clue how to piece them together at the start of my writing on both of my papers this semester. At the end though, once the smoke cleared, they both felt much more cohesive and honest than if they had been placed under the classic rigid structure that my 9th grade teachers of old would have employed. I truly feel that the skills taught to me in this course will be essential as I continue my journey as a writer, as the ability to work flexibly and alter one's writing cannot be understated, especially in a world with so many possible ideas to write about. I definitely would advise any incoming students that read this and that are planning on taking an ENG 125 course to really try and use this class as a learning experience. Use your essays as foundations to put your ideas onto a page, and don't worry about structure until after. If you really try to do your best and try new things during your papers in this class, you will 100% improve as a writer. I certainly feel as if my writing is a lot more cohesive and structured now, and this has helped me a lot even just for assignments in my other classes that I'm taking. The main reason I'm glad I took this course though was because it was a sort of refresh in my mind. As young writers we are taught many rigid, rubric-bound ideas when it comes with regard to our essays, and we aren't allowed to do much else. The problem with this though is that there is little room to improve and grow when trapped with the same means of writing. Through all the texts we read through this semester, there was a common theme; that being that growth and excellence in writing could come in a multitude of ways, and that one should not feel constricted to the format of their assignment. By allowing myself to be freed from the standard 5-paragraph MLA mess of a prison, I have grown innumerably as a writer, and I have to thank this course for it. Although this class seems intimidating, it is worth it. Consider taking it if you are incoming next semester. Have a great day guys and remember to kill the 5 paragraph essay.. .

t3_n0dwq0,2021-04-28 12:40:51,My mind is going dark again,"I only got into U of M from pure aggression, aggression fueled by anger. I was unhappy with where I was in my life and pushed myself beyond my normal capacities and ended up in U of M. . . I was scared to come at first because it was such a dramatic shift, but I decided to come and see what was different. The curriculum was more difficult but my interest in Computer Science kept me going. I love and do well on the projects given in courses like EECS 281, and EECS 440, I just like working on projects. . . But for some reason, I just can't get past EECS 370, I might be failing it for a 2nd time, and I'm sure I'll be the first student to be taking it a 3rd time. Even if I pass, it's making me think, why am I so close to failing it again?. And I have to just accept the fact that maybe I've become complacent.. . Now I'm feeling this anger that I haven't felt in the 2 years I've been here. It's the same anger I had when I wanted to leave my previous environment. I want to graduate from U of M but not in any normal way. I want to escape, just like before. I've become fearful over these past few semesters of how close I've come to failing and barely scraping by. I've only failed once so far which was EECS 370. Failing it again is too much. Anything more it'll get to the point where I will burn through my grant money. At that point I won't be able to afford coming here anymore and all the effort would've gone to waste. My time enrolled at this university has went from curiosity, and amazement, and has slowly been turning into annoyance then anxiety and constant fear, and now I'm seeing darkness and my body is shaking from intense anger. Now I feel like I'm being pushed to become that raging individual again... which brings the absolute worse out of me.. . There are these moments in my life I can't often remember because there's just this intense amount of anger and aggression from within me in response to where I'm at in my life. I feel like I lose entire months sometimes because I just turn everything and everyone away. I came here because I wanted to experience something new and I did and it was fun. I don't want to go back to being so angry, but I feel I'm going to let it happen again regardless if I pass 370 or not because... I unfortunately need it. I can't go to full capacity without feeling a hatred towards something, and now that hatred is aimed at UofM. But I acknowledge it is my fault for getting to this position, for being complacent, for letting my guard down. I should've treated this environment like any other before it, an enemy something trying to hurt me either physically, mentally, or financially. I need to shutdown. Go back to how I was in order to pass. I need to pass these courses and move on with my life. I want to forget about ever being here. Just one more year. . . One more year.. . I shouldn't feel this way about this university, this was suppose to be my escape from a bad place, why do I feel this intense hatred and anger again I was suppose to love this place . . .",44,"My mind is going dark again. I only got into U of M from pure aggression, aggression fueled by anger. I was unhappy with where I was in my life and pushed myself beyond my normal capacities and ended up in U of M. . . I was scared to come at first because it was such a dramatic shift, but I decided to come and see what was different. The curriculum was more difficult but my interest in Computer Science kept me going. I love and do well on the projects given in courses like EECS 281, and EECS 440, I just like working on projects. . . But for some reason, I just can't get past EECS 370, I might be failing it for a 2nd time, and I'm sure I'll be the first student to be taking it a 3rd time. Even if I pass, it's making me think, why am I so close to failing it again?. And I have to just accept the fact that maybe I've become complacent.. . Now I'm feeling this anger that I haven't felt in the 2 years I've been here. It's the same anger I had when I wanted to leave my previous environment. I want to graduate from U of M but not in any normal way. I want to escape, just like before. I've become fearful over these past few semesters of how close I've come to failing and barely scraping by. I've only failed once so far which was EECS 370. Failing it again is too much. Anything more it'll get to the point where I will burn through my grant money. At that point I won't be able to afford coming here anymore and all the effort would've gone to waste.

I am currently a marketing and psy minor at my current university, however, I missed the deadline to apply to Ross and UMich doesn't have a psy minor sadly, so I'll probably have to start fresh when minoring in something.. . . .

I am coming from an arts conservatory and after speaking with an advisor, very few of my credits will transfer, next to none. I am unsure of what grade I will be placed into, if my credits transferred I would be coming in as a second-semester sophomore, but that likely will not be the case. I intend on pursuing a RC major, but am not sure if I should actually join the RC. I am interested in learning either Russian or French (leaning towards Russian) and heard that the RC would really help me learn the language.. . My main concern is this: I am transferring from a conservatory BFA program to UMich because I want the ability to explore new areas and try new things, which is hard to do in a BFA program. I want to have the ability to explore, but with how many credits the semi-immersive language in the RC would block off, I'm not sure if it's the best idea to join given my goals. The community of the RC and all that it stands for is a perfect fit, seems like the right place for me, my concerns about the restrictiveness of the language program and my uncertainty as to how many years I have at UMich as a transfer student, are holding me back.. . Being a LSA student who strongly intends to pursue an RC major, would I still be able to participate in the community of the RC without actually joining? I would like to take as many RC classes as I can because the way classes are structured seems like a really good fit for what I'm looking for.. . I would appreciate any advice or insight. Or if you'd like to share your experiences in either the French or Russian programs within the RC. In addition, due to covid I do not have to complete the residency in east quad and will be living off-campus.

Since orientation and course selection is gonna be coming up soon, I had a few questions to ask before the 15-20 minutes I get with my advisor. Not sure what my major will be, but rn I'm interested in aero, mecheng, and data sci. I also want to get a French minor if I get a 4/5 on the AP test or place into the Advanced French course since I'm not sure how many french classes my schedule can actually handle.. . First questions: what reason would someone have for taking an honors physics or math course? I've heard that the curve is pretty nice but would the extra work in the class (at least I assume there would be extra/harder work) really be worth it? Just wondering since I'm usually pretty good with understanding math quickly, so honors calc 3 and diff equa might be the way to go. Physics is a different story tho lmao. Btw I took Calc BC this year, and I've gotten a 5 on all of the full practice tests we've taken so far, so I don't anticipate having to take calc 1&2 again.. . Also for the math sequence, what order would you recommend taking required math courses in? Sample schedules show it as calc 3 --> diff equa --> lin algebra, but I've hard that it's easier to just take diff equa before calc 3. I didn't check to see if calc 3 is a prereq to diff equa so that might just answer my question, but if not how did you feel about the order?. . I took a dual enrollment of the equivalent of Physics 140/141 this past semester at a community college, but quite honestly, I feel like I genuinely learned nothing. I got a lot of help on p-sets from other classmates and friends in college, and the test was basically just p-set Qs with different numbers so it was easy to copy and translate work with little to no mental gymnastics involved. If you gave me every single unit we studied and asked me to do one problem from each, I think I would only be able to solve something with kinematic equations and basic vector calc questions, besides basic stuff like the integral of acceleration is velocity and whatnot lmao. I really feel bad not learning anything from it and want to retake it in the winter semester (I dropped AP chem cuz the teacher was trash online so I have to take it in Fall), but I always see people say how bad physics at umich is and now I'm kinda scared to take it again if I don't have to. I'm just really conflicted between ""easier first-year courses"" and ""actually learning something."" So what opinion would you have on taking the course again?. . What benefits/drawbacks would there be to making an elective course pass/fail instead of graded? I assume it doesn't count towards your GPA and makes the self-enforced quality of your work a little less strict compared to a graded course since you could effectively get a C and end up with no consequences. Is there anything that would make you not want to do that if given the option, though?. . Also, I'm looking at the schedule builder on Atlas and I think I have a pretty good scheduled lined up besides for 2 courses scheduled back to back on the same days. I would end up having calc 3 in east hall and french in east quad right after each other with no scheduled breaks. I looked at the campus map and the two buildings seem really close, but would the built-in break after calc be enough time for me to walk/bus/bike over there easily? For reference, I usually walk a 15 minute mile lol.. . Last question, I swear. Which section of ENGR 100 did you take and would you recommend it? If not, did you have any friends or know of anyone that really loved a different section and would recommend that one? There are too many interesting options for me to make a decision by myself when they all would fit into my schedule one way or another, and my friends are sick of hearing about engineering things lmao.. .

t3_np14ze,2021-05-31 11:23:35,Questions About Undergraduate Public Policy Major,"Hi!. . I'm an incoming international freshman in the college of LSA who is planning to major in economics and/or political science. Recently I started researching about the undergraduate program at Ford School of Public Policy and I feel like the public policy major there is really interesting considering my interest in the social sciences in general and the public sector. The major is interdisciplinary and being in Ford as a small undergraduate cohort sounds like I'll have more personal attention and more resources.. . Though it also looks like admissions to the program are pretty competitive during the sophomore year. I'd be happy if current students in the program or those who know about the program can help me with some of the questions I have:. . 1- What kind of courses should I take in my first two years to prepare for the program? I think there aren't requirements to apply for the major but I am guessing some prior knowledge definitely helps with the required courses for the public policy major.. . 2- What do they look for in the applicants/what makes a difference in the applications?. . 3- I am sure I'll have time to explore my interests (also career wise) during my first two years and this will probably be one of the factors while deciding to apply to the program. But I'm also wondering if I can work in the private sector after graduating. Overall, what kind of careers can I pursue?. . 4- Lastly, but more importantly, I wonder what you feel about the program. What were your experiences like? Are you happy? What do you feel about the opportunities and did you do any internships?. . Sorry this is a little long.

I didn't show up to class, didn't do any of the work, and spent all my time sleeping, eating junk food, and wasting away my time on the internet. . . Part of this may have been due to my boyfriend committing suicide, but I think a lot of it was just me being in a sad, lazy, burnt out funk. . . Second semester rolled around and while I told myself I'd change, I did not. I failed all but my English and BCOM class. . . It's not that I'm not intellectually curious, it's just that I was in this really horrible funk and could not get out of bed most days. Since last semester ended, I've been taking steps to turn my life around (getting help, getting back into shape, taking free online coding courses). I also somehow managed to get called back to an F500 company where I interned last summer. . . I just want to know if anyone has been in a position where they were able to turn their life around/get job offers despite failing freshman year, or whether this kind of damage is irreparable (especially because I'm hoping for a career in finance/tech).. I also am in a bit of damage control mode now and am not sure what the best course of action is. My advisor tried reaching out to me last semester but I did not respond to her. Will I be suspended from the University?",negative,0.8144047856330872

I'll be joining in pretty late and I'm an international student transferring from a university in Europe, which only makes things more complicated and confusing. Everything will be different and honestly I'm so so excited, but I'm also very nervous. Any tips for how to make things work/get used to life at umich? . . Most unis in Europe don't show nearly as much school spirit and usually aren't as big either compared to American colleges. The education is different too as I couldn't really choose my classes nor could I double major/take a minor, which makes me both very excited about class registration but also quite stressed. The campus is almost 30 times bigger than that of my current college. You see, all of this = excitement but also = much stress.. . Honestly, I keep checking my mailbox for even a slightest update, looking at pictures of the campus and reading about all the cool stuff that is awaiting and I really can't wait for august. But it also makes me quite nervous as I want to fit in obviously and make the most of my time there.

[Gondor calls for aid] [ slight rant],"Apologies for the throwaway account, I don't want to reveal my identity, as this post is kinda super embarrassing.... . I did my undergrad at another school in another state and masters at UofM. Last summer, I became a PhD student. However, due to COVID and related issues, I have not been able to socialize at all for more than a year. The friends I have made before COVID during masters have all graduated and moved away. I haven't been feeling well mentally speaking either. I thought about going out for walks which usually improve my mood, at least pre-covid times.. . Today I went for a walk, which is supposed to be good; but I realized everyone was either in a party or a couple and I was there all by myself. It felt so bad walking around downtown AA and realizing there are so many people out there yet I am alone. I thought about dining out but it feels so awkward to dine out only to look at my phone. I ended up going back home and ordering food, like how I do most of my weekends. It almost feels as if the weekends are but a period of nothingness before I go back to work in the labs again and it makes me more and more depressed. I want to break out of this cycle but I do not know how. I am no longer staring into the abyss, the abyss is around me.. . I don't know if others in my situation feel the same but for me it is extremely difficult to socialize as a grad student. I am between the age of 25-28 \[M, if it matters\], live around campus, so I feel perpetually out of place. Most of the groups on campus are also oriented towards undergrads (and they haven't been active in person either as far as I know.). . In my opinion it is not due to a lack of trying, there are some resources available that I have tried, like Wolverine Support Network for grad students last semester, but due to the online nature of the meetings I was unable to make any meaningful connections.. . Furthermore, I am an international student and I look like an international student. I can't but help notice this fact is a hurdle by itself. While it is true a lot of international students stick in their own groups, it is also true that those who try to reach out are often ignored. I dread the question ""where are you from."" I have learnt to lie about it. Additionally, even though I am an international student, I have spent 1/2 of my life in the US, which lands me in no man's land culturally speaking.

Like many others, this last year has been difficult for me to find and make connections with others at Michigan.

You may have heard of D&D from Stranger Things or maybe you've listened to a podcast about it before. To briefly explain, Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop rpg, which is kinda like a boardgame, where a group of people get together to chill and play a game where you pretend to be a group of fantasy heroes (or villains) slaying monsters, looting treasure, and creating a story. Long story short: D&D is a nerd game, but there's nothing else quite like it and you won't regret giving it a shot.. . I've been playing D&D for about 5 years now with various groups of friends and it has been a huge help in my life. It gives me a space to socialize with others and destress about a bad day or exam. I think everyone should get a little bit of Dungeons and Dragons in their lives. This is me reaching out to any of y'all who may be curious about D&D, I am a complete nerd about it and would absolutely love to share and talk about it with others.

For most of my life I halfheartedly committed to future occupations; I said I'd be a physicist, doctor, etc. not out of exclusive desire to be a physicist, doctor,etc. but for the comfort of a solid future. I have good grades (>3.8), I've taken a large amount of EECS, Physics, and Math courses, and I've done most of my area distributions. I've interacted with analysis of the Punic era, computing cohomology classes, double-ended queues, DNA synthesis, organic chemistry, etc. Nothing has really stood out fundamentally about these subjects/classes.

But even that is complicated by this huge sense of anger and grief, that my entire life could have been better and maybe I wouldn't have failed/dropped out of so many classes at uni had someone, anyone, seen the blatantly obvious signs when I was younger and just. did something about it.. . I'm fully aware that this isn't anything special and that it happens to so many people, especially women like me, even at much later points in their lives as well, but I can't help but feel like it shouldn't have to, and with a love for all things psych as well I'm wondering now if I should make the move towards exploring that. Someone needs to make this more aware, to offer help and treatment and understanding from a neurodivergent perspective, and honestly I'd love to do that but from where I'm standing I have no idea how.. . I've learned a little bit about non-traditional med school applicants but I can't help but feel that they wouldn't look twice at me, especially with how poorly I've done in undergrad (which is abt a 3.2ish I believe currently so it's not even that bad, just bad in terms of moving on up to even higher education). And that was in a BA, not a BS.. . I'm not even sure where'd I'd do if not med school--can you go to grad school for a master's in psychology or psychiatry? I'm not even sure if this is the right sub to post in but here I am. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",error,0.0

The [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack#offers) comes with a **ton** of links to other services. While the bulk of these services are for software development, there are some which could be useful for those not in the field. I know quite a lot of students use Canva for their clubs and there's a free 1 year subscription to Canva Pro that can be activated at any time. . . - 60 premium icons per month from Iconscout for 1 year. - Unity Student Plan if you do game development in Unity (free as long as you're a student). - Access to a bunch of premium web development courses on various platform (under the Learn tab). - Free 1 year .me domain TLD registration with Namecheap. - Lots more - check it out!. . If you have an existing GitHub account with a non U-M email, you can add your U-M email to it as a secondary email and then sign up with your U-M email. If you don't have an existing GitHub account, you could sign up for one with some other email and add your U-M email to it, or just sign up with your U-M email, it shouldn't really matter as long you have a U-M email linked to your account. It says you may have to wait up to a month for approval but I got the verification within a few hours.. . Hope this is helpful!. . Sidenote: I've not actually used any of the other services yet, so I don't know how quick the signup process/integration is for those.. . Sidenote 2: It seems the Unity Student Plan isn't listed on the GitHub page anymore, but [Unity themselves still have it listed](https://store.unity.com/academic/unity-student).

I'm already pursuing a double major in physics and math and was planning on adding a 5th year anyways since I don't want to go to grad school but I want to take grad courses and it seems like a triple major in comp/data sci would keep my options open as much as possible. Any recommendations on whether to take the third major and which one should I take (data or comp)? Thanks. . Edit: this is a REAL predicament.. . Edit 2: I'm basically done with the math major, just need my FYWR and UYWR. Physics will be done first semester of next year. Seems like, with an additional year and a summer semester, a data/comp science major is feasible? Maybe I'm horribly wrong.",neutral,0.50055992603302

The first instance happened about a month ago where my professor assumed I had a prejudice against a particular ethnic group (which she is also a part of) based on my disdain for a political leader (dictator) in my home country from the 1980s (to clarify I mentioned their authoritarian and fascistic policies as to why I dislike him and never mentioned his ethnicity at all). They were extremely aggressive towards me in following class, even read out the DEI statement and made direct eye-contact with me. Everyone in the class knew it was referring to me. I immediately spoke with them after class to figure out what happened and apparently she has experienced people from my country/region being racist towards that ethnic group and projected that experience on me. Apparently this all rooted from an email I sent them to submit an assignment and I forgot to add a ""Dear, Dr. so and so"" in the email. I apologized profusely for this mistake but they never apologized for there initial assumption. I figured this could've been an emotional response based on previous trauma so I didn't think much of it later.. . Additionally, whenever they mention the ethnic group from above, especially in regards to systemic oppression they always call on me to ask what I think, implying they think I'll be supportive of their oppression? It's little things every class hinting at my apparent immorality.. . Second instance happened soon after that where I mentioned my research which focuses on China relations with Latin America and comparing it to LatAm's relations with the USA. I genuinely don't know how, but they assumed I was a super pro-China person from this statement and attacks me whenever the word China comes out of my mouth. I had a presentation on the readings for the week recently in class and one of the readings mentioned China.... but like Ming era China so not super related to what I research. To say they ridiculed me in front of the class would be an understatement. They said I didn't do a close enough reading for the materials, (I pulled an all nighter for this presentation knowing they would be extra critical based on the topic), and called me an arrogant writer that pretends like they're the expert in this field. I was able to pull myself together and try to clarify a few of my points during the presentation but they shot me down every time. I pretty much cried when I got home and received other messages from the students in the class saying the professor was very rude.. . As for the other student, they've been extremely distressed about comments towards them, similar from the ones I received. She spoke with the professor and has been helped with writing a paper for a publication. One day the student received advice from a different professor, in regards to a specific topic within the paper (I believe it was queer studies which the OG professor, the one this post is about, is not an expert in). To say my professor blew up is an understatement. They apparently felt personally offended that the student would even ask for other opinions as if they were not good enough to be their sole research advisor. Recently that student was ridiculed in class after not understanding how a specific reading was relevant to the course and asked for help understanding. The professor said, without hyberbole, that they worked so hard on writing this syllabus and they feel disrespected about the implication that the readings don't correlate with the course topic. They continued on by saying if the student doesn't enjoy the readings they should have and still should drop the course.. . They also keep claiming both of us have a ""blind spot"" for China even though we've never praised it in class or ever, and the student is literally from Taiwan.... . Since this has been happening for a while I've kept the emails of some of the disrespect they have been showing us, I have the support of the students in the class, and I recorded the events of the last paragraph and plan on recording any interactions I have with them from here on.. .

t3_ytfdpc,2022-11-12 18:57:46,There's no real way the school can justify pushing it's students this far in my eyes,"Keep in mind, I'm 27, had a bit of life experience before going in, had my share of burn out before now. . . Burn out happens when you push yourself too far and in those times I was burnt out, I had to say well, I had to push myself that far, there was no other way forward. . . But the thing is, the school is really pushing students to the point where, even without jobs, students often need to do work on the weekends. Teachers demanding you attend their classes instead of watching recordings if that works better for you post covid, and just a lot of work. Also students are encouraged to some degree to double major and that makes group work all the more challenging. It gets so easy for students to burn themselves out. . . They can't say they are preparing us for the job market because our work teaches us broad skills for it, but the work place in many cases ends up being so different, it reduces how much throwing all this work and expectation on us really helps the miore misguided it is.

Burn out happens when you push yourself too far and in those times I was burnt out, I had to say well, I had to push myself that far, there was no other way forward. . . But the thing is, the school is really pushing students to the point where, even without jobs, students often need to do work on the weekends. Teachers demanding you attend their classes instead of watching recordings if that works better for you post covid, and just a lot of work. Also students are encouraged to some degree to double major and that makes group work all the more challenging. It gets so easy for students to burn themselves out. . .

(I've actually been a fan since Juwan first suited up for the maize and blue, but although there were some tough losses during the golden Ed Martin years, I was too young to accurately gauge the true level of *stinkiness* of a given game like I can today.) . . Also, I will limit these to non-conference games. While there were some dirty stinkers inside the Assembly Hall, and at least one shamefully stinky half in Columbus where Michigan scored like 8 points, all those conference games sorta blend together in my mind. The novelty of playing some west-coast team for the first time in 100 years only to release a foul torrent of waste on the basketball court is more tragic to me than, say, dropping a loveless, soon-forgotten stinker on a cold January night in State College, Pennsylvania. . . Without further ado:. . 1. Michigan 46 vs. South Carolina 61, 2016. . Basically, the Other Carolina realized that if you denied the entry pass, Beilein's well-oiled offence got more gummed up than my dog after stealing a rather pricey wedge of manchego last Christmas. Perhaps the most unwatchable game of basketball since they stopped playing in soiled pyjamas with a sand-filled medicine ball in 1902. The wolverines shot 7% from three, which is a very stinky fact. . . 2. Michigan 53 vs. Arizona 80, 2014. . Michigan always gets diarrhea when they play Arizona. Some times it's bacterial, some times viral, sometimes perhaps even caused by fungus. Last season's 80-62 result was pretty stinky, but 80-53 is objectively nine points stinkier. Admittedly that Arizona team was loaded with the kind of size and athleticism that only large suitcases full of money can buy, but it was still a shamefully, repugnantly stinky performance by young men receiving full scholarships at U of M.. . 3. Michigan 52 vs. Utah 68, 2009. . The early Beilein era was especially stinky at times, since despite the valiant and underappreciated efforts of Corperryale ""Manny"" Harris and DeShawn Sims, there were several D-3 level ""athletes"" playing serious minutes back when JB still thought that shotblocking was a sinful act. The high altitude of Utah was cited as a reason for Michigan forgetting how to play basketball. But infamous trailer park bad-boy Marshall Henderson also dropped 22 on us as a freshman. Which was stinky.. . 4. Michigan 60 Ohio U. 65, 2012. . To John Beilein's credit, his teams always showed up in March. Even when they got into a plane crash that one time. Well, except in 2012 when mid-major Ohio (not THAT Ohio) kicked Trey Burke and co out of the tournament. The game itself wasn't necessarily as stinky as some of the others listed above, but it was a tournament upset and I had told all my friends about how great this Burke kid was, only to have him turn in an embarrassingly mediocre performance, which some might say stank. . . 5. Michigan 58 vs. SMU 82, 2015. . I didn't actually watch this game because I had had an frightening premonition that it would stink to high heaven and guess what, it did. Caris LeVert tried to be a hero but ended up a zero, well actually he scored 5 points in 37 minutes, shooting 7%.

I want to keep a 3.0 at least for internship options and am aiming to pull my GPA up next semester.

Don't get me wrong, Professor DeOrio is a great lecturer and seems to really care about his students and clearly wants everyone to succeed in his class, but some of the way that the class is organized, in particular, with regards to the projects, is sort of iffy.. . The material covered is pretty reasonable, webdev is a super broad field and you can only cover so much of it in one semester, and what the lectures cover seems like a great place in this sort of course. . . The main issue is with the projects; projects 1 and 2 are not bad at all and are actually pretty fun and a totally reasonable thing to ask students like us to do given what was covered in the lectures. . . Project 3 is where the trouble kind of starts, not much of React is covered in the lectures at all and we're basically just told to go read React documentation until we can figure it out. Eventually, I finished the project and did pretty well, but it took FOREVER for that initial domino to fall so that I could model the rest of my React components the same way. I don't even really feel like I could go back and redo the project without learning everything again. It took me forever to figure out what props/state meant and I think I would just have to do it all over again because at the end of the whole project, I still wasn't really sure.. . Project 4 was a really strange one too. You're told that it's about mapreduce but its really more like a file I/O project because the whole mapreduce part is just running a couple executables that they give you on some files. It was interesting at the end eventually but this project suffered the same fate of 'the first domino took forever to fall'.. . Project 5 was actually pretty cool to design but I think this one was the worst case of said domino effect. All of the staff was so adamant that we should read the spec like 5-10 times before we start out pipeline, which is fair to some point. But I feel like if you have to read the spec 5-10 times before you even begin to design your project, then maybe some Paoletti/281-type videos should be associated with the project so that we have some sort of understanding of where to start. Having us read Madoop documentation + the spec at us repeatedly can only go so far. And I get that at this point, we should be better readers of documentation than we were when we took 281, but there were some aspects of project 5 that we just not laid out particularly well in the spec that could have told to us verbally in a 5-10 minute video. Real-world documentation has *tons* of examples and interactive components that weren't really there in some 485 specs, so I feel like this isn't a super unreasonable ask. . . Really I feel like some project videos for some of the projects, particularly project 5, would have gone a really long way in helping students and avoiding horrendous office hours queue times. It would ease the load on students and IAs by a lot, and DeOrio is a great professor who I know would make it so that these videos would be super informational and helpful. . . I said some of this in my course eval, and I don't mean to just complain, because I know that some of this is on me since the project averages in this class are *really high,* so honestly I could just be dumb. But I found myself spending around 1-2 hours a day on projects 3-5, and then 3 days before the deadline I'd have to spend close to 7-8 hours a day, and a lot of that time was just trying to understanding what I was supposed given the project spec to do (or going backwards to change old code since I didn't understand it well enough) rather than thinking about my code.

Yes, it is also **graded for correctness, not completion.**. * In the lab, you have to complete small math projects using MatLab. They are not necessarily hard to do, but they are difficult to understand. They focus on your understanding of the in-class content, and the code is supplied to you for the most part.. . My advice:. . * **Get help from the Math Lab**. The Math Lab is located in the basement of east hall at B860, and it is open Mon-Thurs from 11am-4pm and 7pm-10pm, Friday from 11am-4pm, and Sunday 7pm-10pm. I completed the majority of my homework assignments in the math lab, and it was extremely helpful to have tutors to assist with the problems whenever I was confused. After going many times, I found my favorite tutors and would check their schedules online here: [http://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/undergrad/mathlab/mathlabsched.html](http://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/undergrad/mathlab/mathlabsched.html) . . Even if you aren't struggling with the homework, being in the math lab can connect you with other Math 215 students to further your understanding, and it is definitely a bonding experience (misery loves company!).. . * If you're like me, you may find the math lab to be intimidating your first time there. Give it a chance and you'll find it very helpful.. * **Working with a study group.** I made a lot of friends through Math 215, and we would all come together once a week to finish/check the homework. Don't forget, it's graded on correctness! I am also a big believer that explaining an answer to the group helped me learn. . * **ATTEND A GOOD LECTURE!!!** Give your professor a chance, but honestly, there are just some professors who aren't that great at lecturing. In my case, I lasted about a month with my registered professor before I gave up. ProTip: Professor James Heffers' lectures were both useful and entertaining.. * **Go to office hours.** You don't even have to go to office hours for your registered professor. I went to Heffers' office hours and found them very helpful. He would help people conceptually understand the homework problems and answer any questions people had from the lecture. These are useful because you can also hear other class members' questions and gain a better understanding.. * **Check your lab assignments before submission**. Since only one member of your group will be submitting the assignment, it is important that you check it. I was in a group where all members of the group, including myself, did one aspect of the assignment correctly. However, the person who submitted it did not do it correctly. As a result, ALL members of the group lost points. By the end of the course, every point matters, especially since there are so few lab points to begin with.. * **Study the past exams.** The exams are not going to drastically change between semesters. Since they generally cover the same topics, similar problems may be presented in your exam. For example, in the final exam that I took, there was a problem which was almost exactly the same as a problem from a 2018 exam.

t3_zxskyt,2022-12-29 02:09:26,A Guide to Ross Club Recruiting,"Hey guys I was reading some posts and saw some people looking for advice for Ross club recruiting and I just wanted to give my two cents. I've gone through the recruiting cycle as a candidate and as an interviewer/final decision-maker 6 times combined and I've heard many misconceptions about what we looked for. This advice is specifically for consulting clubs (but probably applies to other clubs) and is based on my personal experience. . **We don't care about mental math:** there's a lot of math in our interviews but we care more about why you are doing your calculations. I've had candidates get the concepts right but do the math wrong, and sometimes I move on because we're short on time and they got the big picture idea down. With that being said brushing up on your long multiplication and division isn't a bad idea just so you don't run into time issues. . **We don't care about knowing specific random facts:** sometimes it might seem that you need to know the population of a city or something like that for an interview question. You don't. We expect that you give an estimation and, most importantly, how you arrived at the estimation.. . **We don't care about resumes:** It's the last thing we look at and I rarely look at them at all. Most candidates are underclassmen so we aren't expecting much experience.. . **We do care about your thought process**: on both the written and in-person interview talk us through your thought process.

Good luck!",1,"A Guide to Ross Club Recruiting. Hey guys I was reading some posts and saw some people looking for advice for Ross club recruiting and I just wanted to give my two cents. I've gone through the recruiting cycle as a candidate and as an interviewer/final decision-maker 6 times combined and I've heard many misconceptions about what we looked for. This advice is specifically for consulting clubs (but probably applies to other clubs) and is based on my personal experience. . **We don't care about mental math:** there's a lot of math in our interviews but we care more about why you are doing your calculations. I've had candidates get the concepts right but do the math wrong, and sometimes I move on because we're short on time and they got the big picture idea down. With that being said brushing up on your long multiplication and division isn't a bad idea just so you don't run into time issues. . **We don't care about knowing specific random facts:** sometimes it might seem that you need to know the population of a city or something like that for an interview question. You don't. We expect that you give an estimation and, most importantly, how you arrived at the estimation.. . **We don't care about resumes:** It's the last thing we look at and I rarely look at them at all. Most candidates are underclassmen so we aren't expecting much experience.. . **We do care about your thought process**: on both the written and in-person interview talk us through your thought process. Be able to come up with and communicate your solutions step by step. There are certainly other things we look for, but this is the big one. . **We care about who you are:** don't be an assohole (if a bunch of Ross students think you're an asshole, that's an issue) and network so we get to know you.

There is also an online learning system for psych that is quite expensive that I do not want to buy until I am sure I am committing to taking psych 112. . I plan on taking double honors chem 215/216, Biophysics 150/151, Engr 101, and Psych 112. This combined is 18 credits, but I don't have any other commitments this semester. I was thinking about dropping psych 112 but it seems to be a rather easy class despite it being 4 credits. Would this be possible?

(scheduling to facetime on Sundays with your family is a great cadence).. . \-also to avoid homesickness, try to avoid spending too much time alone in your dorm/apartment.. . \-don't expect everything to be perfect. a lot of the growth that comes with study abroad is because it's hard to be away from your comfort zone in a new culture and (possibly) language.. . \-consider what to bring vs. what to buy when you're there. things like towels or shampoo/toiletries are easily accessible around the world and otherwise could take up a lot of space in your suitcase.. . \-try looking up the city you're going to on TikTok to get ideas for fun things to do in your city/travel ideas/tourist stuff. your exchange program/university should also have resources on this as well, but TikTok is a great place to start (especially for stuff that is more niche or less well-known).. . \-lean on your study abroad peers. share how you're feeling, what you're experiencing. they're going through the same things, so they can be a great source of support if you're struggling to adjust or just want to vent.. . \-try to create a routine - even if it's just for morning coffee or something.. . \-if you need to find a subletter, start looking early. you can use facebook groups, groupmes, or other student forums to start spreading the word. also checking with the study abroad office at umich because we'll have incoming exchanges students too that might also be looking for housing.. . i found some useful convos on this online [here](https://login.peervine.io/p/4365085) and [here](https://login.peervine.io/p/4386781).. . anything else anyone would add?",9,"Study Abroad Tips. so im about to go abroad for next semester and i've had so many questions as i've gotten prepped to go. i've asked around to friends and online and here are some of the top tips i've gotten about dealing with studying abroad:. . \-get involved in activities or organizations available in your city (i.e. ballroom dance). . \-schedule times to check in with your friends and family, but it's best to not spend time every day. that can just make you more homesick and take time away that you could be using to explore and live new experiences.

Best place to see them fly in (a pretty cool sight of thousands of crows streaming across town) is anywhere a) flat or b) high up near downtown A2.

t3_10ezg38,2023-01-18 05:44:01,"For all the freshmen in CS taking 280 right now, here's something that I really wish someone would have told me:","Currently a sophomore here, and this is all me talking about my personal experience , but I really wish I had seen something like this last year. Obviously it won't apply to everyone, just sharing what I would have told myself in the past. That said, if you're taking 280 right now, and 281 in the first semester sophomore year, absolutely don't have the mindset of ""oh I'll just wait until 281 to learn data structure and algorithm and leetcoding and apply to internships during the winter semester. After my project/internship is over in summer let me chill for a couple of weeks."" Leetcode throughout the summer along some personal project and whatnot to beef up your resume and start applying right away in fall. . . This thinking is disadvantageous for many reasons. First, when they say that the big companies hire more during autumn, they mean that by a lot. I believe it is much easier to get a call back at places if you apply first semester - people I know with similar resumes/level of abilities got into fantastic places, but here I am applying now without even a call back after many many applications. It is entirely possible to get an offer second semester, but your odds of getting one, especially a good one, is way higher first semester.. . Second,you won't be good at leetcoding after 281, at all. Your preparedness will go from a 0 to a 5 out of 10, if not less. If you think you'll practice leetcoding for a couple of weeks during winter and start acing mediums, it ain't happening to me right now. Yes, many places ask easy level questions, and the blind 75 is enough. But tying it back to my first you I think the strategy is to start leetcoding through the whole summer and get really good at it while working on some projects to beef up your resume, and you might just have a shot at the better companies. Data structure and algorithm does not take 281 to learn at all. The class is more complicated (don't get intimidated by it, not that hard tbh) because it goes into HOW different ds and alg work, but practically speaking we don't need any of that. Going through a YouTube course and learning how to use basic data structures should get you started right away. The truth is that at our level, there aren't even that many general topics that we need to know for leetcoding. I can think of maybe 12 that come up frequently.. . Third, mental health. Imagine in your second semester without an internship. All your friends have gradually accepted their offers. You see them online on video games everyday, or start going to the gym, or just enjoying life, and here you are leetcoding at home and sending those applications. My mental health has taken such a big hit in the last few months. I am constantly in a state of anxiety, insecurity, and sadness. I could have done two leetcodes a day for ~1.5 hours max during summer, only about applications in the fall semester, and just relax right now. But instead I need to balance my personal project, extracurricular, my research, my job, my classes, sending out applications, and figuring out how to fucking decode alphabet letters into their corresponding letters and being on the verge of tears when it ain't working out (which inspired this post). I don't want anyone else to experience this. It is SO MUCH more efficient in a every way possible to get prepared during summer, when you can still chill while coding. . . Four, believe in yourself. You can totally get an internship sophomore year. Absolutely don't tell yourself that you can't do it, and lie to yourself that you'll push it back until you're in 281 because deep down you don't believe that you are smart enough to learn ds&g on your own, or that people will think your resume sucks, or whatever. You're only making it worse by pushing things back. Everyone else sucks too. I've seen so many people with absolutely horrible resumes, but we can all get internships had we put in the grind. Worst case is applying to and getting into lower tier companies after 500 applications and springboard your way to big tech in junior year. But you never know what'll happen so just apply right off the bat in fall and keep applying and applying and applying. This is so cliche but you really miss every shot you don't take. Even if you suck at leetcoding just apply, you get better for every failed interview, and you miss those real life opportunities living the the false sense of security that 281 will save your life. It won't, you will.. . Five, this is more tangential, but leetcoding I think is pretty fun when you start getting good at it. The dopamine hit when the loading circle goes through and it shows you solved a problem is so damn satisfying. You'll feel like you're actively learning; every question teaches you something new that you didn't know. Look at other solutions, and be amazed by clever coding patterns that you can apply elsewhere, and new uses of a data structure that you never thought of. Coding during the summer the the leisure of extra time I think is great regardless. It's like working out almost. I feel accomplished and motivated every day when I wake up and get that green check next to a problem. So yea, do it when you aren't under pressure and you may just like it.. . I don't think anyone is reading up to here so I just wanna say this whole grind, rat race, whatever you call it thing is so bullshit. I think something is seriously unhealthy and unsustainable about the whole application cycle. I feel like a clown just dancing around trying to please these companies, who barely take two looks at my resume before throwing (figuratively) it into the trash. I think I'll need to see therapy soon to talk and I always thought I had a strong mental fortitude. And you know what's the worst thing is? I feel like a garbage piece of shit when my friends tell me about the amazing places they'd get into, I'd pretend to be so fucking happy for them when deep down I am sad and angry at myself like a useless, pathetic piece of shit who doesn't care about their friends at all. You know what? I don't rly know anything, he'll maybe leetcoding during the summer wouldn't have changed anything at all for me, maybe I'd be as much of a failure as I am regardless. HEY bit it may work for you and I do feel like what I said has A BIT of value to it haha. So here ya go. Mb it's almost one and I feel kinda weird about all this after writing now but I wrote it already so I'll post it, if I'm completely wrong please don't flame me to hard.",0,"For all the freshmen in CS taking 280 right now, here's something that I really wish someone would have told me:. Currently a sophomore here, and this is all me talking about my personal experience , but I really wish I had seen something like this last year. Obviously it won't apply to everyone, just sharing what I would have told myself in the past. That said, if you're taking 280 right now, and 281 in the first semester sophomore year, absolutely don't have the mindset of ""oh I'll just wait until 281 to learn data structure and algorithm and leetcoding and apply to internships during the winter semester. After my project/internship is over in summer let me chill for a couple of weeks."" Leetcode throughout the summer along some personal project and whatnot to beef up your resume and start applying right away in fall. . . This thinking is disadvantageous for many reasons. First, when they say that the big companies hire more during autumn, they mean that by a lot. I believe it is much easier to get a call back at places if you apply first semester - people I know with similar resumes/level of abilities got into fantastic places, but here I am applying now without even a call back after many many applications. It is entirely possible to get an offer second semester, but your odds of getting one, especially a good one, is way higher first semester.. . Second,you won't be good at leetcoding after 281, at all. Your preparedness will go from a 0 to a 5 out of 10, if not less. If you think you'll practice leetcoding for a couple of weeks during winter and start acing mediums, it ain't happening to me right now. Yes, many places ask easy level questions, and the blind 75 is enough. But tying it back to my first you I think the strategy is to start leetcoding through the whole summer and get really good at it while working on some projects to beef up your resume, and you might just have a shot at the better companies. Data structure and algorithm does not take 281 to learn at all. The class is more complicated (don't get intimidated by it, not that hard tbh) because it goes into HOW different ds and alg work, but practically speaking we don't need any of that. Going through a YouTube course and learning how to use basic data structures should get you started right away. The truth is that at our level, there aren't even that many general topics that we need to know for leetcoding. I can think of maybe 12 that come up frequently.. . Third, mental health. Imagine in your second semester without an internship. All your friends have gradually accepted their offers. You see them online on video games everyday, or start going to the gym, or just enjoying life, and here you are leetcoding at home and sending those applications. My mental health has taken such a big hit in the last few months. I am constantly in a state of anxiety, insecurity, and sadness. I could have done two leetcodes a day for ~1.5 hours max during summer, only about applications in the fall semester, and just relax right now. But instead I need to balance my personal project, extracurricular, my research, my job, my classes, sending out applications, and figuring out how to fucking decode alphabet letters into their corresponding letters and being on the verge of tears when it ain't working out (which inspired this post). I don't want anyone else to experience this. It is SO MUCH more efficient in a every way possible to get prepared during summer, when you can still chill while coding. . . Four, believe in yourself. You can totally get an internship sophomore year.

MPool is a mobile app that matches UMich students together to Uber to the airport together. It's currently available here and ready to serve students for this Spring Break:. . [https://linktr.ee/mpoolum](https://linktr.ee/mpoolum).. . Here's more about it.. . I'm a second-year undergraduate here at UMich. I'm out-of-state, so I've had to get to the airport to go back home for breaks. So far, I've been using a combination of the Michigan Flyer and Uber/Lyft. Although both of these have been able to get me to the airport, neither are optimal:. . * Michigan Flyer is cost-effective but the buses are often full near break and don't support flights that are arriving late in the night. The flyer also only departs from the Blake Transit Center, which can be inconvenient especially if you're carrying lots of luggage.. * Uber is on-demand and essentially always available, but it's expensive. It's been at least $50 per ride for me, but I've see the prices spike to over $100 before.. * You can sometimes find someone at DTW that's Ubering back to Ann Arbor after your plane lands, but this isn't reliable and they might not be heading to your same location.. * Especially if you live in a dorm or large apartment building, there are so many other students living next to you. Almost certainly someone else is heading to the airport near the same time as you, but it's difficult to connect with the person leaving at the same time and going to the same airport terminal.. . I've attempted to create a solution to these problems through an app I'm calling MPool. It's available on iOS and Android and provides an effortless way to find other students who share a similar departure time and departure/destination locations.. . Here's how it works:. . * It requires a [umich.edu](http://umich.edu/) Google account login to access.. * Once you login with an [umich.edu](http://umich.edu/) Google account, you choose a season to create a request on. (ex: ""Spring Break to DTW"" or ""Spring Break to Ann Arbor""). * You enter the time you would like to the Uber to depart, then you enter your departure location and destination location.. * You are sent a push notification when our systems find a match. You can then accept or decline. Accepting will put you into a pool with your match while declining will put you back to searching for a match.. * Once you're in a pool, then you will have the ability to talk to the students you matched with and plan where and when specifically to meet up, discuss splitting the fare and logistics, and exchange contact info if desired.. . FAQ:. . * Can I search for a match myself? Manual match searching is not supported. MPool handles all the matching automatically. I've tested it with small groups of people and it works phenomenally.. * Does MPool book the ride for me? Unfortunately, Uber does not allow us to send them requests to fulfill. I understand that this is a point of friction in the experience. If the app gains popularity, I'll find other companies to fulfill the ride requests and integrate payments so riders don't have to book the ride and split the fare themselves.. * How long does it take to find a match? It depends. You are sent the notification immediately once someone else creates a compatible request. I'm not sure how long this'll take, but it'll be faster the more people use it. It would help to tell people you know about MPool and would be greatly appreciated.. * Can I create a basic profile on the app? Yes, you can add a description and other content to your profile to let others know you better once you match.. . I've tested the app and everything works smoothly, but sometimes bugs and details slip through.

I don't even eat a lot of fast food but I'm surprised that there's not at least one major burger chain somewhere on central campus.

In short, we are currently the most dominant team in the entire game with OSU, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Texas A&M being serious challengers... and gaining fast on our lead.. . This game is all about getting more participation - the more people join a team, the more powerful it is. It is also a fun social game - allowing interaction with fellow players through both Reddit and Discord to discuss strategy and other topics.. .

Dread it, run from it, College Football Risk arrives all the same.. . I am proud to announce that Season 3 of Reddit's almost-annual College Football Risk is now LIVE. You have 36 hours to join your favorite team and put in your first move at [**https://collegefootballrisk.com/**](https://collegefootballrisk.com/). . **DISCLAIMER:** **This will be the ONLY post allowed on** [r/CFB](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/) **discussing Risk.

The more players attack/defend a territory, the more likely your team is to win it. And the more days you play, the more your attack power increases.. . In short, it is a popularity contest with a bit of strategy. In long, it is an MMOG-style game where thousands of players from college football fanbases compete daily for control of a fictional map of North America. The goal is to recruit as many players as possible, eliminate your rivals, and control as much territory as possible for ultimate domination of the map. Lose all your territories, and you're out! If your team is eliminated, you have the option to permanently join another team, or join the undead Team Chaos horde.. . While 'winning' *is* the ultimate goal, for most players the fun is in the memes, the banter, and the hilarious circumstances. Like when a team survives despite having 2% odds of success, or when Auburn and Virginia Tech try to make a death march to Hawaii, or when hundreds of players attack Tempe, Arizona for almost no reason at all. There is even a ""Heismeme"" vote at the end awarding the most creative and entertaining reddit post of the game.. . For some history on the game, we even have our own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Risk). . ***What's different this time around?***. . * **Significantly Larger Map** - Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean were added, 51 territories in all. * **Colonizable Territory** - Grab free land while its hot!. * **3-Turn Head Start** for most teams - Some teams start in a harder spot than others. Use this head start to gobble up a region quickly, or just to *get the heck out of there!* (**Note: this means that surviving teams from the last game can only defend for the first 3 turns, and Stanford for 1 turn**). * **Region Bonuses** - Like Continent bonuses in Real Risk, in this case your whole team gets a power multiplier for holding a region of territories. * **Permanent Mercenaries** (Transfer Portal) - You can now choose to permanently join another team if yours is eliminated. So be nice to teams with their back against the wall, maybe their players will join you! And be careful what team you kill...they may make your enemies stronger.. * **New Chaos Mechanics** (for extra chaos) - Chaos, based in Bermuda, can now attack a completely random set of territories every turn. Nowhere is safe!. * **Sunday Breaks** \- Can still place your move for 48 hours. * **3x Or Nothing Bonus** if facing elimination - Do you only have one territory left? Gamble it all with a 50% chance to either multiply your star power by 3, or by zero!. * **Roll Reveal/Recap Twitch Stream** - Roll reveal stream and discussion most nights starting around 10pm on [DodgerofZion's twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/dodgerofzion). * **More map bridges/ferries** to move around the map quicker than ever and limit ""safe corners"". * **Star power tweaks** - The 'power' gap between 5 star players and 1 star players has been reduced. * **New User Interface** - Even has *customizable backgrounds!*. . \**You'll notice many changes help small and mid-sized teams who now have their best chance yet to survive and grow into contenders, or at least be thorns in bigger team's sides. Other changes are meant to make the game more entertaining, engaging, accessible, and fair*. . ***How do I know the game is fair?***Like with 2.0 under BlueSCar, this game is fair for a number of reasons. The game is open source [here](https://github.com/CollegeFootballRisk/Risk), as is every roll, and there are no re-rolls (\*Unless a roll fires when it isn't supposed to, as was the case on 1/23. All moves made will still count for the real roll) . We also have a system monitoring for alt/bot accounts. Leadership positions are held by a variety of teams to avoid conflicts of interest - Head game developers are from Texas A&M and Alabama, I am from Ohio State, the subreddit owner is from Texas, and the development teams are composed of players from Wisconsin, Michigan, Clemson, and Georgia Tech. Join the discord to meet any of us!. . ***What's the point?***There isn't one. It is a completely arbitrary reddit competition with no prize for winning, other than bragging rights. And yet, this stupid game somehow gets thousands of people to come together and click a button once a day, stare in anticipation at a map every night, and build communities of fans posting memes and sharing banter that have lasted for years.. . So grab your friends, grab your family, grab your *collegiate fan group,* and try it out.

t3_10rtiuo,2023-02-02 16:10:28,"CFB Risk Day 12 - It's Groundhog Day...again (also, Notre Dame is finally dead)","*Note: Today's recap written by a guest-speaker, filling in for our friend EastCoast Esq. Get well soon - that's an order, soldier.*. . ""... every player can remember with remarkable accuracy the outstanding tough beats of his career."" - some guy. . Yesterday news broke about the fall of Ann Arbor to rogue attackers from osu, with a call to action put out for all the Maize & Blue faithful to join the cause and liberate our homeland... and by God you responded. Yesterday alone saw our team grow by \*96 new players\* - a daily increase that hasn't been seen since the first days of the game. Magnificent.. . Michigan is \*still\* the most powerful team in the game and we will need every bit of it to win. We recorded 834 players last night with a combined power of 1785 stars (and remember - each player's number of stars increases the longer they play the game, even after a few days); both numbers were large improvements over the previous night's values. OSU is still the second most powerful team in the game, but has now had two consecutive days of \*decline\* in player count (527 players for a combined 1146 stars). We need to continue our growth to stay ahead in this game (Texas A&M is gaining fast, but we'll talk about them later), so if you haven't already - get involved! If you already have, the get \*someone else\* involved! Recruiting matters.. . So about that... We intended to strike the forces holding our homeland hostage and take it back. And we hit it. Hard. I mean, we dropped a proverbial nuke on the place. We had **237 players** that sortied to take back Ann Arbor last night... that's over one quarter of our whole damned team - with a combined star power of 516, after multiplier bonuses - dedicated to reclaiming that one territory, despite fighting on fronts spread out across North America. ... and it was rebuffed. This wasn't like firing a nuclear missile at a large spaceship looming ominously over your city and seeing the massive explosion, only to find after the smoke clears that the large alien ship still just sits there smiling at you (having powerful protective shields which can apparently easily absorb nuclear blasts). No - osu only had seven (7) players (likely rogues) defending it, with a total star power of 13.5 after accounting for multiplier bonuses. This was the equivalent of dropping a nuke on rat, only to find that somehow the rat was hiding in a radiation shielded tin canister that miraculously had large concrete debris fall all around it and above it - yet not crushing said canister - with the concrete debris protecting the canister from the blast wave and intense heat. And the rat calmly climbs out of the rubble a few days later and proceeds to defecate in your kitchen cupboards (which also somehow survived the destruction). We had a 97.45% of winning back Ann Arbor and just got shafted by the luck of the roll. Bad beat. Oh well - we try again tonight. We \*are still\* going home.. . This would be a good time to have a high level view of the war: some way to visualize how things are progressing... like a map.. . . . [It's Groundhog Day... again.](https://preview.redd.it/hyew5wxmusfa1.jpg?width=899&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0479ec1c2ca800e018abd2feb796953d52bdd474). . With all that being said, things are still looking good... maybe good-ish (or at least OK).. . A reminder before getting into further details: we are still active members in the **Big Ten Alliance**, having (formally) non-aggression pacts with osu, Wisconsin, and Nebraska... with the stated goal of killing the SEC rather than killing each other. It's a nice theoretical construct at least.. . We still hold the northeast corner of the map, a region known as the Canadian Shield, which is giving us a nice bonus multiplier that amplifies all of our moves (both attacking and defending). The central portion of Canada is another one of these regions (called Northern Lights) and Wisconsin is trying to expand to fill that space. We still have small skirmishes with them in this region as well as around the Great Lakes, most of this being the actions of rogue players exchanging territories (Wisconsin was able to take back Madison last night, which was where their largest attack was focused). The northwest corner of the map is still under our control and we have been working our way south along the coast to try and take the entire Pacific NW region (we almost managed to kill off Washington in the process).. . The mid-Atlantic region and adjacent locales (east Appalachians and Ohio river valley) are becoming a jumbled mess. Aside from the normal squabbling over border territories between Michigan and osu, Georgia Tech has managed insert themselves into the area... even taking control of a piece of eastern Ohio. We also happened to retake Toledo (again) due to some lucky rogue actions and Wisconsin grabbed Cincinnati. Tennessee got a second straight night of ridiculous luck and nearly doubled their number of territories... not to mention securing the entire West Appalachia region and now get a bonus for that. Iowa State is confined to the upper Midwest now and they will continue to harass Wisconsin for at least a few turns.. . Our earlier amphibious landings in the Southeast have allowed us to create a nice little pocket in Georgia and northern Florida, for which we still hold a beachhead connecting to our New England territories. This has put us in direct contact with other SEC foes: Alabama, who has until now been somewhat holed up in their home region, and Florida, who has been trying to kill off Georgia and UCF (the latter of which died last night).. . Looking west of the Mississippi river in the south is where things start to get dicey. That is where you will find Texas A&M, currently the third largest team by player count but in second place overall due to the large number of territories they control. They also happen to control two entire regions in the Texas/Arkansas/Louisiana area and are getting \*double\* the bonus that we are. To make matters even worse, they are not significantly threatened on their eastern, western, or southern flanks. Most of the teams near them (Alabama, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma) are either directly allied with A&M or else not strong enough to truly challenge them. The only team that is close to challenging them is our ally Nebraska, so of course A&M is focusing most of its attention on hitting Nebraska - with positive results the last few turns.. . Further west, There are still a handful of very small teams (Oregon, USC, Stanford, Hawaii) trying to survive for a few more turns by hiding out in California. This will not be an option for them much longer as Nebraska has been approaching from the east (and may be compelled to flee that way if A&M forces the issue) and we are pushing down from both the north and from the south (courtesy of our expanded beachhead in Baja California).. . Wrapping up the southernmost end of the board, Mexico and the Carribean are both at serious risk of becoming A&M strongholds as well in the next few turns. They have already made significant forays into these regions and there isn't much to stop them. We do have our Baja California outpost to try and contest the rest of Mexico, but we also were able to take Puerto Rico last night using one of the seaways connecting to the East Coast mainland (osu is down there too now, having taken the same route the previous turn). We might be able to fend off A&M from taking the whole Carribbean from there, but regardless the situation down south is really starting to... heat up.. . A final reminder: it is strongly recommended to join the Michigan Discord server and coordinate with our friendly team leaders for assignments/orders (see link below).

Get well soon - that's an order, soldier.*. . ""... every player can remember with remarkable accuracy the outstanding tough beats of his career."" - some guy. . Yesterday news broke about the fall of Ann Arbor to rogue attackers from osu, with a call to action put out for all the Maize & Blue faithful to join the cause and liberate our homeland... and by God you responded. Yesterday alone saw our team grow by \*96 new players\* - a daily increase that hasn't been seen since the first days of the game. Magnificent.. . Michigan is \*still\* the most powerful team in the game and we will need every bit of it to win. We recorded 834 players last night with a combined power of 1785 stars (and remember - each player's number of stars increases the longer they play the game, even after a few days); both numbers were large improvements over the previous night's values. OSU is still the second most powerful team in the game, but has now had two consecutive days of \*decline\* in player count (527 players for a combined 1146 stars). We need to continue our growth to stay ahead in this game (Texas A&M is gaining fast, but we'll talk about them later), so if you haven't already - get involved! If you already have, the get \*someone else\* involved! Recruiting matters.. . So about that... We intended to strike the forces holding our homeland hostage and take it back. And we hit it. Hard. I mean, we dropped a proverbial nuke on the place. We had **237 players** that sortied to take back Ann Arbor last night... that's over one quarter of our whole damned team - with a combined star power of 516, after multiplier bonuses - dedicated to reclaiming that one territory, despite fighting on fronts spread out across North America. ... and it was rebuffed. This wasn't like firing a nuclear missile at a large spaceship looming ominously over your city and seeing the massive explosion, only to find after the smoke clears that the large alien ship still just sits there smiling at you (having powerful protective shields which can apparently easily absorb nuclear blasts). No - osu only had seven (7) players (likely rogues) defending it, with a total star power of 13.5 after accounting for multiplier bonuses. This was the equivalent of dropping a nuke on rat, only to find that somehow the rat was hiding in a radiation shielded tin canister that miraculously had large concrete debris fall all around it and above it - yet not crushing said canister - with the concrete debris protecting the canister from the blast wave and intense heat. And the rat calmly climbs out of the rubble a few days later and proceeds to defecate in your kitchen cupboards (which also somehow survived the destruction). We had a 97.45% of winning back Ann Arbor and just got shafted by the luck of the roll. Bad beat. Oh well - we try again tonight. We \*are still\* going home.. . This would be a good time to have a high level view of the war: some way to visualize how things are progressing... like a map.. . . . [It's Groundhog Day... again.](https://preview.redd.it/hyew5wxmusfa1.jpg?width=899&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0479ec1c2ca800e018abd2feb796953d52bdd474). . With all that being said, things are still looking good... maybe good-ish (or at least OK).. . A reminder before getting into further details: we are still active members in the **Big Ten Alliance**, having (formally) non-aggression pacts with osu, Wisconsin, and Nebraska... with the stated goal of killing the SEC rather than killing each other. It's a nice theoretical construct at least.. . We still hold the northeast corner of the map, a region known as the Canadian Shield, which is giving us a nice bonus multiplier that amplifies all of our moves (both attacking and defending). The central portion of Canada is another one of these regions (called Northern Lights) and Wisconsin is trying to expand to fill that space. We still have small skirmishes with them in this region as well as around the Great Lakes, most of this being the actions of rogue players exchanging territories (Wisconsin was able to take back Madison last night, which was where their largest attack was focused). The northwest corner of the map is still under our control and we have been working our way south along the coast to try and take the entire Pacific NW region (we almost managed to kill off Washington in the process).. . The mid-Atlantic region and adjacent locales (east Appalachians and Ohio river valley) are becoming a jumbled mess. Aside from the normal squabbling over border territories between Michigan and osu, Georgia Tech has managed insert themselves into the area... even taking control of a piece of eastern Ohio. We also happened to retake Toledo (again) due to some lucky rogue actions and Wisconsin grabbed Cincinnati. Tennessee got a second straight night of ridiculous luck and nearly doubled their number of territories... not to mention securing the entire West Appalachia region and now get a bonus for that. Iowa State is confined to the upper Midwest now and they will continue to harass Wisconsin for at least a few turns.. . Our earlier amphibious landings in the Southeast have allowed us to create a nice little pocket in Georgia and northern Florida, for which we still hold a beachhead connecting to our New England territories. This has put us in direct contact with other SEC foes: Alabama, who has until now been somewhat holed up in their home region, and Florida, who has been trying to kill off Georgia and UCF (the latter of which died last night).. . Looking west of the Mississippi river in the south is where things start to get dicey. That is where you will find Texas A&M, currently the third largest team by player count but in second place overall due to the large number of territories they control. They also happen to control two entire regions in the Texas/Arkansas/Louisiana area and are getting \*double\* the bonus that we are. To make matters even worse, they are not significantly threatened on their eastern, western, or southern flanks. Most of the teams near them (Alabama, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma) are either directly allied with A&M or else not strong enough to truly challenge them. The only team that is close to challenging them is our ally Nebraska, so of course A&M is focusing most of its attention on hitting Nebraska - with positive results the last few turns.. . Further west, There are still a handful of very small teams (Oregon, USC, Stanford, Hawaii) trying to survive for a few more turns by hiding out in California. This will not be an option for them much longer as Nebraska has been approaching from the east (and may be compelled to flee that way if A&M forces the issue) and we are pushing down from both the north and from the south (courtesy of our expanded beachhead in Baja California).. . Wrapping up the southernmost end of the board, Mexico and the Carribean are both at serious risk of becoming A&M strongholds as well in the next few turns. They have already made significant forays into these regions and there isn't much to stop them. We do have our Baja California outpost to try and contest the rest of Mexico, but we also were able to take Puerto Rico last night using one of the seaways connecting to the East Coast mainland (osu is down there too now, having taken the same route the previous turn). We might be able to fend off A&M from taking the whole Carribbean from there, but regardless the situation down south is really starting to... heat up.. . A final reminder: it is strongly recommended to join the Michigan Discord server and coordinate with our friendly team leaders for assignments/orders (see link below). This is how to \*most effectively\* use your attack & defend moves to get us closer to actually winning the game. However... fighting for your school, your team and your home is always a good thing, even if you have your own ideas about how to do that.

t3_10tp265,2023-02-04 19:34:31,CFB Risk Day 14 - EPISODE XIV: THE AGGIE MENACE,"*Note: Today's recap written by a guest-speaker, filling in for our friend EastCoast Esq. Get well soon - that's an order, soldier.*. . ""Never tell me the odds."" - some guy. . . . https://reddit.com/link/10tp265/video/8kxtsjtw48ga1/player. . The war continues on as we come to the completion of the second week of action. Battles now rage all about with mixed results for the Maize & Blue faithful. We were tantalizingly close to securing up to \*four\* separate regions at one time, yet a combination of unfortunate actions by the hamsters running the core of the CFB Risk random number generating black-box left us one territory short in three of those regions. We began the turn with two regions, attempted to gain two more, and ultimately ended with only one - so a net loss there. We regained control of eastern Canada, the Canadian Shield Region, and we are still receiving a bonus for that. What does this mean? For this turn, every **attack** move placed this turn is getting **amplified by x1.5**. Every **defend** move placed this turn is getting **amplified by x2.25**. It's not as much as last turn, but it helps.. . *A quick explanation of ""regions"", since we will be discussing them more and more going forward:*. . *The game is moving into phases where teams will be competing to control entire ""regions"", which are groupings of adjacent territories.* *The map is divided into twenty regions, as shown below.* *Just like in the classic Risk game, there are incentives to control whole regions - but in this game it is a mathematical bonus to \*all\* attack/defend odds in favor of teams holding regions (those bonuses are not limited to actions taken within held regions - they apply everywhere).*. . . . *Controlling regions is good.* *Preventing opponents from controlling regions is also good.*. . Michigan is \*still\* the most powerful team in the game and now is when we are starting to demonstrate that. We recorded 780 players last night with a combined power of 1909 stars (and remember - each player's number of stars increases the longer they play the game, even after a few days). The player count was slightly decreased from last night (again), but this could be attributable to last night's hockey game, the beer run to Canada, organizing one's sock drawer, the local throat singing tournament, your spouse forcing you to put away the smartphone for the evening (\*yes dear, of course I'm paying attention to the movie\*), or any number of other (weak) excuses to not put in the entire two minutes of effort to enter a move. Pretty much all teams saw a minor drop in participation last night (again), so this is not a cause for concern. osu is still the second most powerful team in the game, but has now had four consecutive days of \*decline\* in player count (504 players for a combined 1265 stars). We need to continue our growth to stay ahead in this game so if you haven't already - get involved! If you already have, the get \*someone else\* involved! Recruiting matters.. . This would be a good time to have a high level view of the war: some way to visualize how things are progressing... like a map (now with added region boundaries and sea-routes, for your viewing pleasure).. . . . Two steps forward, one step back.. . By now the northeast corner of the map (eastern Canada, New England, and portions of the mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes states) has been well solidified as our base of operations. We took back the east coast of Hudson bay from Wisconsin (which gained us the Canadian Shield Region), but they were able to retake Madison from us (which cost us the Great Lakes Region). osu has been hand-fighting us for control just south of this area in the DMV, Ohio river valley and Indiana/Illinois, with them retaking Toledo and... oh... look who holds Columbus now. How about that?. . Further south in the east Appalachians and into the Carolinas, positions are still contested between osu, Georgia Tech, Tennessee and us. Tennessee still controls the West Appalachia Region and is getting a bonus for that, but they are more of a threat to osu than us at the moment - yet they have now made contact with us in Illinois. Things could get interesting in a turn or two, but more on that later.. . Our little pocket in Georgia and northern Florida has mostly collapsed, but we now control both of the beachheads connecting back to the Canadian Shield Region (there is another in North Carolina). Alabama, Florida and Georgia Tech continue to harass this pocket and try to force us back out - although Florida is down to one final territory and may not be around much longer.. . Wisconsin maintains control of all of central Canada and the Northern Lights Region bonus it entails. We continue to see harassment from them, but they are also attempting to wrest control of the northern US plains area from Iowa State and Nebraska (Iowa State also down to its last territory and Nebraska not far behind).. . The Pacific Northwest Region spans from Alaska all the way to Idaho and Oregon in this map... and it is \*almost\* all ours. A bad beat in Eugene kept us from full control this turn. Next time.. . The West continues to be a hodgepodge of small teams trying to survive: Oregon, USC, Stanford, Hawaii, Texas and Nebraska. Washington didn't make it last night. We have the ability to strike further here from both the north (as discussed) and from the south, expanding from our bridgehead in Baja California, but things are about to get even harrier there because of.... . **Texas A&M**. They continue to dominate the center of the US and are pushing hard into the Southwest & Mexico and are now in control most of the west (right) bank of the Mississippi. At this point they are now the greatest threat (not immediate, but long term) to us on the map. They currently control **three regions** (one of which is completely safe from attack) and are in position to very likely grab a **fourth** this turn in the Southwest. To make matters worse, they are in good position to control up to **six regions** after next turn from the way they are expanding in Mexico and the Caribbean. Stanford, Oklahoma and LSU are still technically alive down in Mexico (aside from our presence in the westernmost part of Mexico), but only Stanford has any real shot of surviving for much longer. osu has made some minor forays into the Caribbean themselves, but they seem more obsessed with fighting us in the north rather than securing this region for themselves. Not only has Texas A&M secured themselves with this strong position, they have little in the way of any major power to check their advances. Their west flank is most small teams or minor outcroppings of other teams. Their northern flank is Wisconsin (who is more focused on us) and Nebraska (who is collapsing). Their east flank is bordered by two other teams, Tennessee and Alabama, that have effectively allied with A&M (or at least put into place a non-aggression agreement). These two teams have shown no real interest sending their forces westward - only east and north (and we are present in both of those directions). Currently A&M is third in the overall player count and raw stars, yet when then region bonuses multipliers are accounted they almost match us in actual power (and we both are more than twice as strong as the next closest team, osu). If A&M is allowed to gain 4+ regions... it may be game over soon.. . A final reminder: it is strongly recommended to join the Michigan Discord server and coordinate with our friendly team leaders for assignments/orders (see link below). This is how to \*most effectively\* use your attack & defend moves to get us closer to actually winning the game. However... fighting for your school, your team and your home is always a good thing, even if you have your own ideas about how to do that. In the end, it's still a game and the purpose is to have fun.. . Team Standings. . We are now down to fewer than 25 active teams in the game from the original 130 and the final rankings are beginning to take shape.

So, the biggest thing about going in as a non-traditional student is, this will not be a college experience for you the way it is for 18 year olds. Whatever experiences you had between high school and college will change how you see college. For me, I came in tired. I just wanted to get my degree and this was , hopefully, going to be the last step to finally get a job and start my adult life. I was surrounded by people 6 years younger than me, with a totally different attitude about college: They were excited. . . They were running around doing all of these new things. I was doing well getting into that myself at first, but then that quickly fell apart.. . The friends I went to this school to be around started to flake / build distance and wouldn' t be honest about it so we could try to solve whatever went wrong. Academics immediately kicked my ass cause I'd never had to do shit this hard. No matter what I tried or how much work I put in, I had to leave CS in the first year. I wasn't about to even try to commit to always staying up to 2AM just to get by. I was just around people at the beginning who were full of themselves and wanted everyone to think their way. I tried to learn what I could learn from them but afterwards I just left that place behind. . . I'm all for debates, but if your ""debating"" is just insisting your perspective is the only way to look at the world and I don't know anything if I don't totally submit to it, I have no interest hanging around. I've found there is a lot of that attitude here, online and IRL. . . College is this weird place where people get really vocal about their political views but you also see that here it's virtue signaling and when you reach out for help cause you're drowning in academics and loneliness well, if people cant sympathize with where you're coming from you wont find much support from them which makes me find any politicking they do to be hollow noise and virtue signaling / only serving groups they or their friends are part of. So, yeah I didn't have much support system, hence the drowning. I'd go home to living situations in my first two years with roommates who insisted to kind of live their own way, and you had to abide by it. I never felt I had much room to advocate for my self. When I tried I'd just get emotional response of why it'd be too hard to like not make the whole apartment smell or whatever. I always had to be the prime person making sacrifices. I've had to learn that people in the college age range really struggle with what it really means to live with someone else, and we both need to make sacrifices.. I had/have work to do as faar as accepting that myself but at least I'll do my best to give someone what they need to feel comfortable and try to stay out of their way.. . All of this just really fucked with my mental health those two years. I hated walking anywhere in Ann Arbor because I'd literally get in some CPTSD fit where some memory or intrusive thought of someone shitting on me for thinking some sort of way would pop up. I'd get angry and it'd just be really difficult to function until I could calm myself down. Went through like, 7 therapists the whole time I was here. I wanted to get better, but none of them provided the structured approach I needed to get better. . . One did but my insurance rejected her a few weeks later just because she was in Brighton. I have better insurance now but it's like, Do I want to start therapy if I'm probably going to be leaving soon?. . Last two years have seen a big improvement, I left CS and prepared myself / applied to UMSI and got in Sophomore year. Moved to a co-op, def isn't perfect but again, huge improvement to what I was dealing with before: I actually developed social skills, wow /s. I'm in a place where college is tough as far as juggling everything but not impossibly difficult. I try my best to make the most of what is here though the first two years definitely impacted how I view the school overall. things feel disappointingly easy now academic wise, I couldn't find the right level of challenge for me. Sometimes there's a fun challenge but work sort of feels tedious at this point. I just want to graduate. A good thing is that I'm now in a group where actual productive debate goes on that actually lets me hear other view points and lets me think about them without getting shut down for my own. It''s so fucking amazing and fun. . . Overall too there were good memories of trying Ann Arbor food, running around to grab free shit thanks to the free Stuff Discord, finding new interesting places and a lot of co-op memories / friends. . . The academic struggles led me to getting evaluated by a neuropsychologist here to be told I have ADHD and very likely Autism (they wouldn't confirm as I didn't have my childhood records) and that's what's made life hard in the past in many ways for me. Medication doesn't work well for me but I found a system for getting shit done to get shit done and not burn out.. . So, overall college has been rough with the dissapointment of hard work not paying off, but also provided lots of room to grow once I found a major I was more suited for and friends my age (grad co-op) that helped ground me. I will soon leave the University with mixed feelings. Overall thankful for what I could get out of it, but praying it can slowly get better for future students and praying I too can keep growing and learning to properly stand up for myself so I'm not asking for too much but am getting treated fairly in situations.

Here are the ways for how you can choose your level of involvement with the team - use only one method within the same turn:. . * If you would like to see/discuss overall strategy and choose your daily mission at the **Michigan Rebel Base**, use the Discord link ([https://discord.gg/DRQyjp56kP](https://discord.gg/DRQyjp56kP)). * Note: if already using Discord, please **do not change** to another method.. * If you want a simple order to follow without overthinking or hassle, use the new orders distribution website ([http://www.whataremyorders.com/](http://www.whataremyorders.com/)). . * For new players or those that are having fun being **Michigan Rogue Force** (or are having problems with Discord / the orders website), we'd love for you to focus on.... * Texas A&M. * Waco (Texas). * Tulsa (Oklahoma). * Ohio State. * Labrador (Northern Canada). * Toledo (Ohio). * Wisconsin. * Alberta (Southern Canada). * Minnesota (....Minnesota). . Whichever path you choose, [we NEED you to continue playing every day](https://collegefootballrisk.com/). Whether you're at the **Michigan Rebel Base** on Discord or part of **Michigan Rogue Force(c)**, your consistency gives us the best chance at victory on a given night and builds your streak, which strengthens your power.. . Last night, 104 warriors with combined power of nearly 500 stars descended on Dallas, TX. The two sides -- the Michigan Rebel Army and the A&M Empire -- fought a bloody battle for control of this symbolically and strategically important territory.. . As you know, though, only one warrior can put their flag down. Last night, that warrior was [WestMichiganBlue](https://collegefootballrisk.com/player/WestMichiganBlue); a humble 1-star who broke A&M's stranglehold on Texas with his 2nd ever move in CFB Risk. As the Dallas MVP last night, he truly exemplified a young Luke Skywalker. . . He also showed an important lesson for Risk players:. . Every. Star. Matters. If you can get a friend to join, he/she could well be the next WestMichigan.. . \--------. . Now, let's talk about the bigger picture..... . Taking Dallas was a big victory, but the Aggie Death Star still stands strong. They only control 1 region for tonight's roll, but that's because ourselves and Team Chaos hold ONE territory in each of 3 other regions. . . In other words, several of their shields are down, but there's a very limited window to strike. With sufficient support, we could do significant damage to the Death Star tonight. We just need a few Rebel Soldiers to hit their target, and the more warriors we have, the more likely one of us will do damage. The **Michigan Rogue Force(c)** could be *critical* tonight.. . . . https://preview.redd.it/yd242cxo0fia1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e8e256c70dd7f3dbb223f343e7f5cd05fef3a2e9. . Fortunately, the Michigan Rebel Army is large, and continues to grow.. . **CHART TIME!!!**. . . . https://preview.redd.it/0362ioup0fia1.jpg?width=627&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35611589f3fbb78a29e214ebce179e6b85544391. . As we've said countless times: RECRUITING MATTERS.. . I also have other very good news. While Wisconsin and Ohio State continue to pressure us in the North, we *did* secure the Great Lakes Region last night, which means we have the same Region Bonus as A&M tonight. You can see just how big of a deal this is based on our Raw vs. Adjusted Stars.. . . . https://preview.redd.it/cr5ccdbr0fia1.jpg?width=627&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=faca7cedfb20b80c6fac9bd2568c96dfab4ac490. . All of this is to say that tonight could be a big night for the **Michigan Rebel Army**.. . Looking at the bigger map tells a similar story.... . . . https://preview.redd.it/v5lotmms0fia1.jpg?width=892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57faec27e9e7f3b6ead91b04d009e74715b47caf. . As you can see, it's a tale of North vs. South. We control most of the North, but Ohio State keeps taking chunks from the East, and Wisconsin continues to play the role of **Anakin** to A&M's **Palpatine**. And in the South....well, you already know. We have made small but vitally important gains on the edges of the Death Star.. . Other interesting features on the map:. . * Midwest/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast: Large chunks controlled by Ohio State, but Georgia Tech, Tennessee, and ourselves have deprived them of any Region Bonuses. . * Also Mid-Atlantic: Georgia Tech secured the East Applachia Region, giving them over 1,000 adjusted stars tonight. They are punching well above their weight right now.. * California to West Applachia: There's an almost uninterrupted band of smaller teams here, including Oregon, Nebraska, Texas, Iowa State, and Tennessee.. * Caribbean: Mostly under Ohio State's control, but the three smallest teams (LSU, Florida, and Oklahoma) are battling for survival down there after getting pushed out of Mexico by the A&M Empire.. . In sum, we've put ourselves into position to make some serious moves tonight, but we need YOU to turn all of this potential into a game changing reality. The most effective way is to join the **Michigan Rebel Base** on Discord ([https://discord.gg/DRQyjp56kP](https://discord.gg/DRQyjp56kP)). . . However, participation is *the* most important thing.

Day 22 Recap: [CFB Risk Day 22 - Third time's a charm.](https://mgoblog.com/mgoboard/cfb-risk-day-22-third-time%27s-charm)",0,"CFB Risk Episode 23 - A New Hope: Last Night's Skywalker. *Today's post written by EastCoast Esq. from* [*MGoBlog.com*](https://MGoBlog.com). . **Pre-Recap Announcements:**. . Here are the ways for how you can choose your level of involvement with the team - use only one method within the same turn:. . * If you would like to see/discuss overall strategy and choose your daily mission at the **Michigan Rebel Base**, use the Discord link ([https://discord.gg/DRQyjp56kP](https://discord.gg/DRQyjp56kP)). * Note: if already using Discord, please **do not change** to another method.. * If you want a simple order to follow without overthinking or hassle, use the new orders distribution website ([http://www.whataremyorders.com/](http://www.whataremyorders.com/)). . * For new players or those that are having fun being **Michigan Rogue Force** (or are having problems with Discord / the orders website), we'd love for you to focus on.... * Texas A&M. * Waco (Texas). * Tulsa (Oklahoma). * Ohio State. * Labrador (Northern Canada). * Toledo (Ohio). * Wisconsin. * Alberta (Southern Canada). * Minnesota (....Minnesota). . Whichever path you choose, [we NEED you to continue playing every day](https://collegefootballrisk.com/). Whether you're at the **Michigan Rebel Base** on Discord or part of **Michigan Rogue Force(c)**, your consistency gives us the best chance at victory on a given night and builds your streak, which strengthens your power.. . Last night, 104 warriors with combined power of nearly 500 stars descended on Dallas, TX. The two sides -- the Michigan Rebel Army and the A&M Empire -- fought a bloody battle for control of this symbolically and strategically important territory.. . As you know, though, only one warrior can put their flag down. Last night, that warrior was [WestMichiganBlue](https://collegefootballrisk.com/player/WestMichiganBlue); a humble 1-star who broke A&M's stranglehold on Texas with his 2nd ever move in CFB Risk. As the Dallas MVP last night, he truly exemplified a young Luke Skywalker. . . He also showed an important lesson for Risk players:. . Every. Star. Matters. If you can get a friend to join, he/she could well be the next WestMichigan.. . \--------. . Now, let's talk about the bigger picture..... . Taking Dallas was a big victory, but the Aggie Death Star still stands strong. They only control 1 region for tonight's roll, but that's because ourselves and Team Chaos hold ONE territory in each of 3 other regions. . . In other words, several of their shields are down, but there's a very limited window to strike. With sufficient support, we could do significant damage to the Death Star tonight. We just need a few Rebel Soldiers to hit their target, and the more warriors we have, the more likely one of us will do damage. The **Michigan Rogue Force(c)** could be *critical* tonight.. . . . https://preview.redd.it/yd242cxo0fia1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e8e256c70dd7f3dbb223f343e7f5cd05fef3a2e9. . Fortunately, the Michigan Rebel Army is large, and continues to grow.. . **CHART TIME!!!**. . . . https://preview.redd.it/0362ioup0fia1.jpg?width=627&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35611589f3fbb78a29e214ebce179e6b85544391. . As we've said countless times: RECRUITING MATTERS.. . I also have other very good news. While Wisconsin and Ohio State continue to pressure us in the North, we *did* secure the Great Lakes Region last night, which means we have the same Region Bonus as A&M tonight. You can see just how big of a deal this is based on our Raw vs. Adjusted Stars.. . . . https://preview.redd.it/cr5ccdbr0fia1.jpg?width=627&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=faca7cedfb20b80c6fac9bd2568c96dfab4ac490. . All of this is to say that tonight could be a big night for the **Michigan Rebel Army**.. . Looking at the bigger map tells a similar story.... . . . https://preview.redd.it/v5lotmms0fia1.jpg?width=892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57faec27e9e7f3b6ead91b04d009e74715b47caf. . As you can see, it's a tale of North vs. South. We control most of the North, but Ohio State keeps taking chunks from the East, and Wisconsin continues to play the role of **Anakin** to A&M's **Palpatine**. And in the South....well, you already know. We have made small but vitally important gains on the edges of the Death Star.. . Other interesting features on the map:. . * Midwest/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast: Large chunks controlled by Ohio State, but Georgia Tech, Tennessee, and ourselves have deprived them of any Region Bonuses. . * Also Mid-Atlantic: Georgia Tech secured the East Applachia Region, giving them over 1,000 adjusted stars tonight. They are punching well above their weight right now.. * California to West Applachia: There's an almost uninterrupted band of smaller teams here, including Oregon, Nebraska, Texas, Iowa State, and Tennessee.. * Caribbean: Mostly under Ohio State's control, but the three smallest teams (LSU, Florida, and Oklahoma) are battling for survival down there after getting pushed out of Mexico by the A&M Empire.. . In sum, we've put ourselves into position to make some serious moves tonight, but we need YOU to turn all of this potential into a game changing reality. The most effective way is to join the **Michigan Rebel Base** on Discord ([https://discord.gg/DRQyjp56kP](https://discord.gg/DRQyjp56kP)). . . However, participation is *the* most important thing.

First, let's point out the obvious -- none of the targets above are Texas A&M. Yes, we know. And you want to know why? Because if you look at the leaderboard, ourselves, A&M, and OSU have 1 region between the three of us, and it belongs to **OHIO STATE**.. . OSU and Georgia Tech have been playing footsie, and now Ohio State has the makings of a Bucky Death Star in my backyard!!!!. . As a Native Philadelphian, I've been content to let my city suffer under Buckeye rule as Michigan swept south. NO LONGER. Ohio State has become too powerful, and it's time to retake my homeland! Oh, and what color is Ann Arbor? Buckeye Grey! The f\*ck???. .

My friend and I are CS freshmen here and wanted to share an app we created with you all. We spent the last month working on this to get it out before Spring Break!. . So, here are the issues we feel exist today:. . As an in-state student, a lot of us know that **many other people from our hometown are at UMich**, but we **don't personally know most of them**. So we don't carpool. We thought that this was inefficient, and sometimes a bummer if you had no other ride home.. . And my partner on this app is from California, so he needs to get to the airport. But **Uber is expensive** and the **Michigan Flyer only runs during certain times of day, leaving from an inconvenient location**.

They said that they've sacrificed everything for me and are willing to move closer to my university so the commute time doesn't have to be as long (which is part of the reason but not all of it). I just want to live on my own on campus, that's enough for me. But it's not enough for them. What can I do to convince them? They said if I sign a lease, they would disown me and may even move back to Syria because there's nothing left for them here (other than my sister but they'd leave her too, not for no reason because she's had some disagreements with them as well). My mom even went as far as saying she would tell her story and burn herself on campus because there was no other reason for her to live.. . . I tried explaining to them that I would not be gone forever, I'm just living there for 1 or 2 semesters and would come back after (they quickly fired and I would not be allowed back), and I would literally come back every weekend, and sometimes weekdays too. I told them that I'd love for them to help me find a safe place to live at and they'd get to choose my roommates. This was not enough. After more back and forth, my dad just said that I just want to go live and do whatever I want (girls, drugs, sex, etc..) and will just drop out of college soon after. Soon, we just agreed to shut the subject down so it doesn't get more heated, but I don't know how to bring it up again, and I don't know what I would say as well honestly.. . . How do I convince them that this is my decision, that it's okay, and that I'll be okay? I really want to do this but I feel like they're a wall that cannot be budged. I have nobody else to ask and don't know what to do at this point.",error,0.0

t3_11omxv8,2023-03-11 15:29:52,On the leftist culture in the Universities,"I recently wrote an article on leftist culture in the universities kind of based on Michigan experience. Thought I will put it here: . . . \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. . On the leftist culture in the Universities. . Mich Haus was founded in 1932 as Michigan socialist house. It is one of many coops on the UofM campus and among many similar coops across the country and many other college campuses. Apart from the smell of weed, there you will find people who believe in and fight for equal rights for people, be it women, minorities including racial minorities, LGBTQ people, people with disabilities, and more. It has provided safe spaces for discriminated people when it wasn't fashionable and stood for them. . These coops embody the spirit of the left that pervades many University campuses across the country and attracts many right-minded people. There are truly inspiring stories from such coops such as when a black person in the 1940s went out to get a haircut and was refused service (at the time of segregation) and the whole coop went with him to get him a haircut. Who in their right minds wouldn't agree that there are huge inequalities in our society and while there are big businesses who only care about their profit, that there are people who are at the receiving end of racism, that LGBT people have been and still are to a good degree discriminated and have a much higher rate of mental illness and suicides, that women haven't been and still aren't given equal pay and opportunity, and all these groups don't have enough representation in the positions of power and role models for the younger generation. In that respect, the left has been the champion of equal rights and has done much good in society such as pushing for equal rights for everyone at the institutional level such as civil rights, striking down the defense of marriage act (DOMA), and many more. Apart from advocating for less government and being economically right ( which are legitimate political issues), conservatives in the US i.e. the republican party are driven by the nonsensical bible belt and unlike the left, they don't have any *intellectual ideological* basis to support their agenda (nobody in today's world can legitimately take an ancient illogical religious document as a basis to live and govern life). The left at least embodies *some* rational principles that people can agree with. . Left in one of its purest forms is Marxist communism which is a *collectivist* ideology based on *altruistic morality* where each person lives for the group (as opposed to any individualistic ideology where each person lives for themselves). Another form of left that has sprung up in the past decades is postmodernism which broadly says that our lives are built around these artificial power structures such as big companies in a capitalistic framework, cis white hetronormative masculinity, all their intersections, and anything in power, who determine the life of the masses based on their whims. They claim these power structures exploit the marginalized people and the people at the bottom aka the working class, LGBT people, and the disabled. And the main goal of this left is to fight against these power structures to achieve more equality where equality in their framework means a lack of any hierarchy and power structures in the society aka an anarchist state. . As mentioned before, most people don't go to this extreme of ideas but then they, while being benign, are not being truly consistent, as true consistency of these ideas leads to one of these extreme radical left-wing ideologies. . Both of these ideologies are *irrational* and like anything irrational they are bound not to work, and worse, they hurt people's rights to their life and property. Left in general is a framework that is built on feelings where empathy, kindness, and compassion are the highest virtues often at the cost of logic, justice, and resourcefulness. One can still in the right mind fight against injustice to any human being and stand and fight for equal rights and equal treatment for all kinds of minorities including racial, LGBT, gender-based and more, as these ideas are derived from logic and it is respectable to live and fight for a society that doesn't discriminate. . But the leftist agenda goes much beyond rights: it is instead built around an ideological framework that doesn't revolve around achieving the highest in a human being, in creating, building, in working hard to make something worthwhile of your *own* life (while supporting rights of others), rather it views the world as this evil tyrannical place and revolves around dedicating your life towards not just fighting for, but lowering your standards and customizing the world for the lowest on the social hierarchy, be it the most marginalized groups, physically or mentally handicapped, and so on, and more than that, in perpetuating the ideas that instead of living for yourself, living for and finding happiness in others is the right framework. Their version of the ideal world is not built around human achievement but built around the less privileged and the more marginalized. . Their altruistic morality is the morality of self-sacrifice i.e. a system where a person places the needs, desires, and life of other people above oneself, and is one of the most evil concepts for which the world has seen the disastrous consequences of, such as the death of millions of people and destruction of economies of the whole countries in many places, be it communist Russia, Cuba, erstwhile east Germany and very recently in Venezuela. On the other hand, any country that has become rich on its own has done it based on capitalist ideas be it the US, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Germany, Ireland and many many more which also lead to the most peaceful times in the history of mankind. Communism and dictatorship go hand in hand as the left needs the force of a big authoritative government to implement their ideas, as they do even in socialist countries since their ideas don't involve voluntary consent of people; no sane person would voluntarily self sacrifice. On the other hand capitalism and democracies go hand in hand as both are based on individual freedom and individual rights (for clarification, capitalism means the right of people to trade freely without external control. The way believing in freedom of speech doesn't mean you agree with what every person says, believing in capitalism doesn't mean you endorse every business, but rather their right to do business freely). . The empirical evidence that leftist ideas don't work in practice is overwhelming. You can't prove a theorem or run a business by shouting your skin color, your gender identity, your lack of talent, the intensity of your need, your marginalized status and your trigger warnings. Reality demands active rational thinking, integrity, character and talent to create value in this world. And incidentally reality doesn't discriminate against anyone based on race, gender, sexual orientation etc. However, the real critique of the left is not based on the utilitarian arguments that they don't work in practice (although it is true and can indeed lead us back to the stone age, see Venezuela), but rather on the matter of rights, that they don't preach the right morality and don't have the right to impose their ideas on others through force i.e. through the government. Left is ideologically an illogical framework because it discredits the idea that an individual has the right to and should live for themselves and in pursuit of their happiness as the most important thing. If one can find a common thread with everything wrong in this world be it Nazism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, white supremacy, or any such form of *collectivist* ideologies where individuals are put together in groups and treated based on some *unearned* group identity, it is that these ideologies are *irrational*. And so is left. . The way Nazis justified their existence and gave racism and homicide of Jews an intellectual justification by propagating the idea that the Aryan race is superior and individuals should serve the state for the greater good, the left gives irrationality of altruistic morality an intellectual framework by arguing that self-interest is bad and (stronger, powerful, privileged) people should self-sacrifice for others and the masses, which is their notion of equality. They perpetuate these ideas and make people believe that rights to one's life and property don't exist, that reality is made up (as postmodernists say) and logic isn't important, rather feelings and experiences are the most important basis to adjudicate a person or a situation, that being rich and successful are not virtues but vices that people should be attacked for, that people's values such as honesty, character, resourcefulness don't matter but it's their marginalization status is the most important criterion, that we should tax the wealthy because the need of the common people supersedes the ideas of justice and property rights. They assume a sense of moral rectitude and superiority not based on logic and achievement, but on the basis of how much they cater to the poor and the marginalized. It is a collectivist ideology where they don't see people as individuals but rather as a bag of identities and their intersectionalities. In their hierarchy, the more privileged you are the lower you are as a human being and the more marginalized you are the better you are. While real olympics have been a platform to show the highest a human being can achieve, the recent wave of wokeness has re emphasized the left ideas where in their inverted world there is a new oppression olympics based on who is oppressed more, who is suffering more, and thus deserves more brownie points. In their inverted world built around the less incapable and the marginalized, they still need someone to keep running the show and they do it by preying on the producers, the achievers; by taxing them, by free riding on them. Their whole ideology is like a new mind virus that takes away any sense of rationality and alignment of human values to reality, and instead presents a new framework that is antithetical to reality and human growth. Since you can't cherry-pick two contradictory ideas, most often the left comes with a whole paradigm of illogicality tied together, where they are anti-western civilization and would find virtues in ancient and tribal cultures, are anti meritocracy and anti-capitalism, anti-individualists and pro communities, and as a consequence of all these, are anti-individual growth, anti-human growth and anti life. . But neither a spacecraft nor a human life can run on illogical ideas. And while the privileged people can still have a concoction of illogical ideas and somewhat run their boat, incidentally it is the very marginalized people who get attracted by the leftist ideas and whom the left hurts the most, where instead of preaching them rationality, *rational selfishness* and an attitude of working towards making their own lives better *despite* their heavy baggage, the left disarms them by incepting in them a victimhood mentality and make them fight other people's baggage as a primary goal instead of fighting their own. This destroys them psychologically and doesn't move them any forward in their lives. In nature, there are kinds of fungi that hijack the brains of their prey which make them kill themselves and spread the spores that help in further proliferation of that fungi. In our society, the left acts like that fungus that psychologically infects people's mind by incepting in them wrong ideas and disorienting them in life, which is one of the worst things you can do to a person. . Today it is these ideas that are permeating the ethos of the Universities, are corrupting the consciousness of the masses and actively destroying the very foundation on which a good part of our civilization is made. It is quite an unfortunate fact that we live in a world where some people are treated unequally and there is discrimination in society and we should fight against all of these. However, there is a logical way to address these inequalities in a way that doesn't involve cowering down, that doesn't advocate self-sacrifice, that still allows and encourages individual freedom, self-interest and *selfish* human growth as rights and the most important ideas for life to flourish, something that is far from the approach that the left has taken up, where left is not the solution but part of the problem.",0,"On the leftist culture in the Universities.

In nature, there are kinds of fungi that hijack the brains of their prey which make them kill themselves and spread the spores that help in further proliferation of that fungi. In our society, the left acts like that fungus that psychologically infects people's mind by incepting in them wrong ideas and disorienting them in life, which is one of the worst things you can do to a person. . Today it is these ideas that are permeating the ethos of the Universities, are corrupting the consciousness of the masses and actively destroying the very foundation on which a good part of our civilization is made. It is quite an unfortunate fact that we live in a world where some people are treated unequally and there is discrimination in society and we should fight against all of these. However, there is a logical way to address these inequalities in a way that doesn't involve cowering down, that doesn't advocate self-sacrifice, that still allows and encourages individual freedom, self-interest and *selfish* human growth as rights and the most important ideas for life to flourish, something that is far from the approach that the left has taken up, where left is not the solution but part of the problem.",error,0.0

Before dissecting this, for the record, every incumbent in CSG including the vast majority of FT, 1/3 of Respect, the handful of independent incumbents and the 2 IU incumbents all voted to pass these budgets without objection ([click here for the breakdown of each party](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-LTn5CJdwpFn1Ry5ojc1iFGB4OASBXudbb0CI7CTNk)). They either didn't read this or were cool with cutting SMPSEC. Either way, it was originally proposed by exec, which is made up entirely of FT members.. . For starters, all of the impactful materials distributed for ""free"" as they promise were actively defunded by over $2,000 this year. We don't have public access to how many Drink Covers that would buy but we can assume that's in the many hundreds. Where did that money go? To well-being days and the teddy bear drive mainly, which included snacks like pizza and chips, a raffle wheel, and a bouncy house. The impact of those hundreds of drink covers cannot be known but I can assume this use of funds and the shady method they were cut by is calculated and the current Forward Together administration prioritizes the veneer of doing something over the functional good of their administration (AKA a big ass bounce house on State Street instead of handing out drink covers indoors or having a free handout box without any fanfare). See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/11me3vt/csgs_forward_together_party_thinks_giving_an/) for more details on how deep the corruption goes (along with the links to all the budgets in the pic).. . Points 2/3 and some of point 4 sound great, excellent in fact, on their surface. However what does ""advocacy"" really mean? Emailing President Ono and the regents repeatedly? Having a public meeting in front of your press allies with Flint/Dearborn to act like you're doing something (more on this later)? To be clear, connection and communication are key to a government's success. However, if a majority of your platform's breakdown on an issue is advocacy and demanding this, it is a clear sign that the facts, even if adhered to, will not produce the change that is implied. And that's assuming FT is not full of political opportunists, inexperienced accountants, and liars (and we've seen some good evidence on this side).. . Both Point 2/4 mention inter-campus collaboration and, for Purdue and Ohio State's models, intercollegiate collaboration. Working with other universities can be key to messaging, which can become unignorable. Plus, the Lyft idea is a good one and all reports from Purdue and OSU seem to be hugely positive, if we could do that (questionable). However, Forward Together is the same administration that decided unilaterally to [withdraw from the Association of Big Ten Students](https://www.michigandaily.com/student-government/csg-leaves-the-association-of-big-ten-students/)\---the very org that Ohio State and Purdue work in together. [When asked about it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpXYYp_2nnjdQPLpiAjtsvI5Z15Jkg7waTIzpgw2F3U/edit#heading=h.2970cy54vloy) (Pg. 6-7), Forward Together presidential candidate Herle, current Chief of Staff, said the withdrawal was taken entirely by ""executive action"" and that they are ""reapplying"" (???). I have no idea why anyone thought withdrawing and then reapplying was a good idea but, regardless, these actions are contradictory to the policies espoused above. The executive branch also [withdrew a proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s_2LuRtkRhZZILiT29X08MbzjrA6ln7oJYojGGoUEPs) to require consent of the Assembly to leave these unions, making the alliance between Flint/Dearborn completely up to the president's discretion.

Even though they already cut SMPSEC by $2200 between semesters, not a single dollar of $80,000 went towards SMPSEC (budget before the error was discovered versus after). If preventing sexual misconduct was a priority, this type of behavior would be unthinkable and a fringe, unheeded viewpoint.. . A few more details: CSG has 0 control over frats and sororities so this pledge is vacant. Partnering with non-student orgs can be difficult since CSG is a non-profit and can't use money off-campus so their mention of SafeHouse is suspect. This part of the platform has a few cool ideas, many non-CSG ideas that cannot be done through CSG action, and many glaring outright lies by omission (the $ being the biggest indicator of true intent). And this is one part of the platform, which we will dissect this week.... . # The State of the Race as of 3/19/2023. . Lastly, I'd like to talk about the state of the election. People assume this is some propaganda campaign when, in reality, this is an accountability campaign to systematically root out the cancer in CSG. So far, Forward by far is the very worst of any party or independent running from what I can tell. They are the only party with a majority of incumbents and the only one whose [baggage](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/11udrhn/after_the_near_5hour_meeting_where_csg_admitted/) is more than inaction in that they directly undermine the goals CSG should be working towards and the problems they are slated to solve. Oh, and they [blew 125k in 2 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/11rrx33/csgs_executive_branch_runs_out_of_money_spending/) so there's that. I'm not going to go into every independent but, in the interest of parties, having a coalition beyond independent collabing is helpful to running an efficient, focused gov. [Respect](https://voteforrespect.square.site/), although having many new faces and a few radical incumbents who are sick of CSG's bullshit, has too few members to have control of the government themselves. If I were them, I would recruit incumbents or make an alliance with the [Independence Union](https://umindependenceunion.com/) since they are ideologically similar. The IU seems a bit bloated but overall the goals seem basic, straightforward and achievable (like funding $100,000 more for orgs). The male/female gap is concerning but that gap seems to be closing as they picked up two more female candidates (not that identities predict governance). Still, the party is majority LSA and could use more representation in the other schools. There are also two independent presidential campaigns, with the two true freshmen clearly being way too inexperienced for this. The other ticket seems to be an MSA replacement ticket for Bilal/Maria who dropped out. They have solid backgrounds and no clear red flags other than being extremely ""active"" activists. They have the biggest problem of having no party, meaning an alliance is critical if they want to govern.. . Overall, I'm not sure which ticket(s) I think are factually the best. I will say that Forward is factually the worst, with some tiny fragments of culpability being on the incumbents running with the IU and Respect (but obv not comparable). I will absolutely not vote for the freshmen nor FT and you shouldn't either. Inexperience and very negative track records should disqualify them from your ballots if we want CSG to change.

t3_11vtmlg,2023-03-19 18:39:58,Thinking about switching to CS from CE,"So I'm a sophomore in CE right now and things are going good and I really like my major. However, after planning out my schedule for the remaining years, I am starting to think I should maybe switch to CS instead. I'm still figuring out exactly what I want to do in the future, but right now I'm leaning towards the embedded systems route. I enjoyed eecs 270 (mostly the labs) and am enjoying 370, but I also found 281 pretty cool too. I chose CE because I wanted to be able to work on both hardware and software, but looking at the CS guide it seems I can accomplish the same thing. I've already completed all the CS requirements except for 376. I've been putting off eecs 215, 216 and math 216 requirements for CE. The thing is, for the embedded/software route I was planning to take for CE, none of my upper levels classes need eecs 215/216 or math 216, so I feel like I am just wasting my time taking them when I could follow the exact same route in CS without requiring these courses. It seems obvious I should switch but I really like being a CE major since it will give me a lot of flexibility in the future even if I don't use those classes in undergrad. But at the same time they take up space in my schedule where I could be taking classes I actually want to take. . .
