Reading the newstories, I too would feel the same anger. However, I am close to many of those in this course and with more context the actions make much more sense.. . Firstly, this course is a required class ever single semester for composition students and so the teacher of the course rotates every semester. The course has a lot of discussion and usually covers many sensitive and/or subjective issues, along with technical and objective lessons. For an example, discussions on how to authentically advocate for disfrenchised groups for which you do not belong to has been a topic in the past. . . As you can tell, these topics can only be thoroughly discussed in an academic manner IF everyone in the course is ok expressing viewpoints and life experiences that can be extraordinarily personal. Way beyond the scope of a typical collegiate course. . . So in an environment based around exploring these topics, having an incident that was at first a simple slip up, be followed by an apology that severely misses the mark on why it was problematic warrants a restart to the course, as now a significant portion of the students feel uncomfortable expressing these deeply personal ties so pertinent to the course.

I know what I am and how I am and how I can be irrational. Anxiety, from a disorder or not, is not surprising in this day and age. . . However, there is a huge difference between having a somewhat irrational anxiety that you're aware of and knowing that although your feelings are valid, that they juxtaposes what most others feel and USING that anxiety as a way to blame, hate and feel validated in judging those around you.. . So no, I'm sorry, but the situation I am describing is not legitimate. One more time, since you clearly need the help, *the situation I am describing* is not a person who struggles with anxiety but rather a person that guilt trips and blames those around them because they are entitled. People are not stupid (excluding you) and they can see the difference between someone explaining their fears and looking for empathy and someone using them to hate. . . For you personally, I would recommend the following: . 1. Stop being an idiot. 2. Try reading more books because you're really bad at following context (what post are we both commenting on right now? Could that give you some hints to the context of the situation I had described) . 3. Deal with your insecurities. Be aware of them.

MDP has honestly been the worst experience of my college career. To be clear, I actually think the project I'm working on is really interesting and my faculty and sponsor mentors are extremely supportive. But the amount of absolute bullshit work my team has had to go through with MDP is ridiculous.. . Every MDP assignment from weekly agendas/follow-ups to big papers and presentations are so so meticulously templated out for you so that if you do one thing that doesn't conform to their standards they will get on your ass. And that is exacerbated when you think about the breadth of MDP's projects and the fact that you simply cannot umbrella all the different types of work being done into one mold of grading. There have been so many times where I read a rubric for an assignment and wonder how the hell I'm going to make this fit with the work I'm actually doing.. . MDP asks that you spend 12-14 hours a week on the project, but having to balance actually working on the project you signed up to do AND deal with all the bullshit assignments they throw at you is literally impossible.. . The MDP staff are horrible people who have I guess forgot what it meant to be a human after spending so much time in industry. My team has had to rewrite TWO of our executive summaries because we got failing grades. The first time we attended office hours and the first words that are spoken are ""this assignment was a trainwreck,"" then we basically got berated for the next hour. The second time we tried to schedule office hours again and they sent back an email asking to make an agenda FOR the office hours (as if we haven't written enough damn agendas) and essentially passive aggressively asking us to cancel the office hours and read their feedback extra carefully before even thinking about asking for help again. Some of the people they bring in for design review panels honestly do have good intentions and try to give good feedback, but others are just absolute assholes and are so stuck in their ways after spending way too much of their life in industry they refuse to recognize that a lot of the decisions being made on the project are subjective and just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean you have to give us a bad fucking grade.. . I honestly do understand why MDP wants to assign us the work that they assign us, but they fail to recognize that we are STUDENTS with school and life to juggle and we ARE NOT FULL TIME EMPLOYEES FOR MDP. MDP should be a learning experience like what college is supposed to be, but they've made it just the worst kind of toxic corporate environment that you'll end up hating yourself and leaving hoping that the real corporate world isn't all like this.",30.0,error,0.0

While I can't speak much to the MDP department's process and behavior with students, I believe our project team worked great together and I really enjoyed my time during the program. Reading through this thread, I think it's probably largely dependent on which project you land on.. . Our project involved 3D printing food designs, so we had hardware (MEs) , software (CS) , and food science (MSE) teams working concurrently throughout the project. We also had them rotate through the more administrative roles throughout the year. The faculty advisor was also passionate and engaged throughout the project. We even agreed that we would give the students full marks, unless they didn't even try (didn't happen). We brought them to our corporate HQ during the project to ask questions with our food scientists, and after the project to demo the prototype for our senior leadership team. While I don't know for certain, I hope the students all had a great learning experience and some fun along the way. . . Reading through these posts, I'm sad to hear that the MDP staff are less than helpful to all the students. I will say that needing to complete templated ""busy work"" is very much part of the corporate world, especially on the IT side. We have to go through a gated review process for all of our major projects, with templated presentation/forms/documentation/weekly updates to complete along the way and uploaded to a specific location. . . My big gripe with MDP is actually the amount of lead time needed to sponsor a project. We are basically asked to have a fully fleshed out project 9 months before it even starts. So once you build in the duration of the project, that's 15+ months before you get results. In the world of innovation, that's way too long to be of any real value.

Since UMSI is an upper level unit, you need to apply to one of the schools/colleges that admits first year students (LSA, COE, etc) and then on your application you can indicate preferred admission to UMSI. Your app would be reviewed by the first-year admitting unit first, and if you're accepted by them, then your app gets passed along for review by the upper level unit (UMSI in your case). If you're admitted by UMSI, you still would still spend your freshman and sophomore years in the other school or college you got admitted to, but it guarantees that you're admitted to the upper level unit and I think you also get the advantage of working with some advisors in your preferred admit unit during your first two years.

The UMSI program is a 2-year program that you do during your junior and senior year (3rd and 4th year). That means for the the first 2 years, you will be in a different school within U of M, like LSA, Engineering, SMTD, or any of the other ones mentioned on the webpage that the other person shared a link to. I think a lot of UMSI students originally came from LSA, which I'd say is a good choice for someone who is aiming to go into UMSI. However, I don't think it really matters which school from the list you originally start out in, so I would choose a school that has a secondary career you're interested in just in case you ever lose interest in UMSI.. . Typically, U of M students apply during their sophomore year (2nd year) sometime before the deadline in February. If you're a pre-admit though, you have an earlier deadline in December of your Sophomore year. Basically, there are 2 rounds that UMSI applications are evaluated in: the pre-admit round and the general round. As a pre-admit, you get evaluated first during the pre-admit round, and if you meet all of the requirements, you'll most likely get in. If for whatever reason you don't meet all the requirements, you may be deferred to the general round, during which your application will be re-evaluated along with all the other applications from students who did not select pre-admit when first applying to U of M.. . Basically, I would just check the box for pre-admit UMSI on your application since it gives you a big advantage later on. It also doesn't lock you in place for anything, so you can always change your mind about UMSI later without any consequences.. . Some general advice for prospective UMSI students: during freshmen year, it's a good idea to take as many of the UMSI pre-requisite courses as possible. There's only 4 of them, so that still leaves a lot of room for other classes too. It's okay to take maybe 1 pre-req during sophomore year first semester, but I'd aim to have most done before sophomore year so that you have most your grades for the pre-reqs ready for when you apply as a pre-admit by December.. .

For the first question, if you're interested in CS, you could apply to either LSA or Engineering (differences noted [here](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate/computer-science-lsa-vs-computer-science-engineering/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/56pa9t/lsa_vs_engineering_for_cs_undergrad/)). Basically, for Engineering, there are more math, physics, and other STEM-focused general requirements whereas for LSA there are more humanities, social sciences, language, and other similar requirements. If you end up transferring to UMSI though, then the old requirements end up not mattering since you essentially completely abandon the old school.. . For the second question, nope, you don't apply to any specific program as a prospective student; you do that after you get here. For now, you just apply to the school you want. Every U of M student starts without a major, but once you know what program you'd like to do, you start taking pre-requisite classes, and after completing those, you can declare a major. Usually, students declare their major sophomore or junior year. There actually isn't anything selective about the CS program. As long as you take the pre-requisites and pass them you can declare.. . So to summarize, right now you just have to worry about which school to apply to. It's probably also a good idea to start researching different programs and learning what the pre-requisite classes are for them so that you can start taking them once you get here.",1.0,neutral,0.530780553817749

However, I just searched up LSA informatics, and unfortunately, according to [this](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/undergraduate-students/undergraduate-programs/informatics.html), it looks like they're discontinuing the LSA informatics program in April 2022, which I think is before you'd be attending. So it looks like this won't be possible to do--sorry about that :( I think they're discontinuing it since the UMSI program has a track that sounds pretty similar.. . I'm not sure what the closest program to informatics in LSA is (maybe data science? Statistics? CS?), but you don't necessarily need to have your program figured out right away. If you take classes like STATS 250, SI 110, a first-year writing course, and EECS 183/SI 106 your first semester, they'll pretty much all count towards both UMSI and LSA, so regardless of what program you end up taking, they'll all have been helpful (not sure if all of those still help for Engineering though, you'd have to check).. . Edit: If you're interested in both UMSI and CS, you could potentially plan to do a UMSI major and a CS minor, or if that doesn't work out, just a CS major. So the first 2 years, you could take the pre-reqs for both UMSI and CS, and if you ultimately do the UMSI program, you could have the CS minor already done or mostly done, but if you ultimately don't do UMSI, you're already about halfway done with a CS major.

The information provided to us, either by the spec or various info sessions, seem to be serving the opposite purpose.. . Euchre is a good project for demonstrating the versatility and power of polymorphism. For example, using a vector of derived class pointers in the driver program so we can invoke different functions under the same name. However, we are given explicit instruction to create a simple player class and a human player class and derive them from the same abstract class. In other words, we are given the blueprint, and we just need to follow it. It might be a much more powerful realization and a better learning experience if we are simply told to use polymorphism, but are left to design the specifics by ourselves.. . On the other hand, we are given the minimum amount of information about designing the driver program. We are told that we should create a Game ADT to keep track of the play but that's about it. I wasn't concerned when I started writing the driver because I have some experience (recreated Othello in cpp, and a few others in Python), but I can understand how daunting a task it must seem to many. That is the part of the project where some more explicit instructions may be helpful. Specifically, what's a good way to approach it conceptually, and what are some of the good design practices etc.. .

They hold weekly member meetings for communication purposes mainly, but anyone can audition for any of the fully student-run productions.

UM School of Music, Theater and Dance (SMTD) Dean David Gier reported Sheng to the ECRT after Sheng screened the 1965 Stuart Burge-Laurence Olivier film adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello in his undergraduate music composition course.. . University officials made no public announcement as to why they were no longer considering an inquisitorial ECRT review of Sheng's curriculum. Instead, according to MLive news, they communicated their decision to his lawyer. The university's action not to review the incident simply confirms the fact that the claims of ""racism"" were always slanderous and baseless.. . However, nothing of substance has yet been done by UM to repair Sheng's reputation. The IYSSE at UM demanded in an open letter to SMTD Dean David Gier that the university had to reinstate Professor Sheng in the course from which he was removed as well as issue an apology and publicly repudiate the smear that he had carried out a ""racist act"" by screening a well-known and honored film.. . A small group of SMTD students denounced Sheng after the 1965 screening because the famed Shakespearean actor Olivier performed the title role in dark make-up. One of Sheng's students subsequently stated to the Michigan Daily that she was ""shocked that [Sheng] would show something like this in something that's supposed to be a safe space."" How a serious, complex performance of an epic, 400-year-old play created an ""unsafe"" space can only be explained by the student herself and the race-fixated layers that pursued the attack on Sheng.. . Olivier played Othello as a dark-skinned Moor of African descent living among white Venetians in part to emphasize the racial tensions present in the 1603 play. The actor intended to honor what most consider to be Shakespeare's original concerns, as well as to repudiate the timidity of previous British productions of the play, which downplayed the interracial relationship between Othello and Desdemona. Olivier and the play's other leads were nominated for Academy Awards in 1965.. . Sheng made an informal apology to his class and then a formal apology to the department. A group of at least 33 SMTD students and faculty then seized upon the apologies to issue an open letter to the dean demanding Sheng be removed from his course for creating a ""harmful environment."" The SMTD officialdom endorsed this reactionary nonsense, issuing a department-wide email stating that ""Professor Sheng's actions do not align with our School's commitment to anti-racist action, diversity, equity and inclusion."". . In this frenzied environment, Sheng stepped down from the course at the dean's insistence.. . The rush to support the claims of racism by the SMTD and campus administration was utterly shameful, indicative of an extremely low level of historical and artistic awareness, to say nothing of democratic sensibilities and rational thought on the campus.. . The IYSSE at UM launched a campaign on the campus to oppose the attacks on Sheng, issuing an open letter to Dean Gier and speaking with students and faculty on campus about the artistic, democratic and class issues involved. Though the Michigan Daily ignored the club's request to publish its open letter in the student newspaper, several professors and artists from around the country have sent notes of support for this campaign and for Sheng.. . Composer Kevin Scott posted a lengthy denunciation of the racialist attack on Sheng and Othello on the popular Slipped Disc classical music website. The IYSSE open letter was subsequently published on the site as well, followed by numerous statements of support.. . On Monday, the Academic Freedom Alliance, ""a coalition of faculty members from across the country who are committed to upholding the principles of academic freedom and professorial free speech,"" issued a letter to UM President Mark Schlissel in defense of Sheng. Although the letter does not make clear that neither Sheng's actions nor the Othello production was ""racist,"" it nonetheless sharply warns of the implications of the attack for academic freedom and intellectual life in the coming period:. . ""Unfortunately, efforts to suppress classroom materials and censor classroom instruction because they might be divisive are all too familiar. The cornerstone of recent state legislative efforts, including those in Michigan, to outlaw 'divisive concepts' like critical race theory or 'racist theories' from the classroom is precisely the belief that instructors should not be allowed to expose students to materials or ideas that they might find disturbing or racist. Universities are in no position to resist such efforts if they are themselves willing to punish their professors on that self-same basis."". . With regards to the action of Dean Gier, it states: ""If such an assertion of power by a dean were accepted, it would carve a large and perilous hole in academic freedom protections that will loom over faculty at the university for years to come."". . A comment is in order about the political climate in which Sheng has come under attack. Over the course of several decades, systematic efforts have been made at the University of Michigan--as at every leading campus in the US--to promote identity politics and variations of anti-Marxist, postmodern philosophy as the axis for so-called left politics. This has been driven by various pseudo-left appendages of the Democratic Party.. . Even as they precipitously and recklessly re-open the university under conditions of a deadly pandemic, administration officials shift ever more resources toward ensuring that race and gender remain a central focus of students, and not the massive social and public health crisis devastating the lives of billions on the planet.. . The university set up an Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in 2016, which underwrites and encourages the concept that race and the effort to achieve ""equity""--not social equality--are the most pressing issues facing students and young people. The office has thus far been given $125 million to develop strategic ""training"" plans across most units on campus.. . In response to the September 2020 strike by 1,200 UM graduate student workers--which culminated in a betrayal of the main demands for safe working conditions during the pandemic--the university seized on a portion of the issues raised involving opposition to ""racism on campus."" Instead of keeping students out of dangerous classrooms and paying graduate students decent wages, the university set up a ""task force on policing"" to include the so-called Students of Color Liberation Front. They also committed millions of dollars to hiring 20 new full-time faculty members ""with scholarly expertise in racial inequality and structural racism."". . This semester figures like Nikole Hannah-Jones and Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, who advocate ignorant and racialist theories of history and science, respectively, have been invited as featured guest speakers on the campus.. . It is in this toxic environment that some SMTD students opposed the screening of Othello, insisting that Olivier's performance was ""blackface"" and Sheng's decision to screen it--regardless of the context or intent--was a ""racist act."". . Students, workers and faculty must oppose this attack on Sheng, academic freedom, and democratic rights. If the attacks on Sheng go unopposed from a genuinely left and socialist perspective, the entire intellectual and political terrain is ceded to the far right, which will step into the vacuum and fraudulently posture as defenders of ""academic freedom"" while simultaneously mobilizing fascistic forces.",56.0,error,0.0

Othello is a rather flamboyant character already, and while it's hard to analyze Shakespeare's work through the lens of modern racial dynamics, it's completely possible to analyze modern productions through the lens of modern racial dynamics. . . On top of that, using a white actor to play a minority role for a character whose race is so integral to the story line sends a message that somehow there wasn't a minority actor you believed capable enough to play that part. It perpetuates a racial hierarchy in casting, undercutting the abilities of performers of all identities.",5.0,negative,0.7046830058097839

I agree with you, the student has the right to complain about a racist practice being shown in class without at least some context. I believe this whole incident can be easily avoided, and if anything, shows the University's failure in its DEI education.. . Rather it is more about the aftermath of the event. Prof.Sheng apologized right after the end of the class to his pupils, and again a few days later to the entire department. For me at least, this is where the University should take over and initialize an investigation/discipline Prof.Sheng as is appropriate. Instead, there was an open letter authored by some students and staff that demanded Sheng to immediately step down. This form of public pressure is perhaps what unsettled some folks. In particular, this open letter attacked Sheng's public apology and called it inflammatory. This might have added to the frustration. As we have seen over the past few years regarding these sensitive topics, apologizing is so often a damned if you do, damned if you don't act.. .

There are plenty of pet-friendly houses with super chill processes to allow them (the process varies from house to house but nothing too crazy. just like a house vote or permission from a roommate), and every house allows ESAs.. . Thoughts on some of those houses from co-oper that doesn't live in them:. . If you are looking for a super close-knit community, I would shy a bit away from Escher simply because it is so large and is a bit more similar to a dorm vibe due to its setup. But just like a dorm, you can still form great bonds with those in your suite. If you're looking to get to know *everyone* you live with, this may not be the place for you, but if that's something you're fine with, there you go! Super cool place and incredible food!. . Black Elk is a great place! I actually find it quite funny how different the house culture is now compared to the infamous reddit post I think you are referring to. They are definitely one of the most chill houses right now and are quite close-knit. They don't really have open parties much anymore, most things are in-house events, so it's definitely on the quiet side but still fun. The house is also a really cute color, so how could you not want to live there!. . Linder also seems like a great place for you based on what it seems like you're looking for. They have chickens. I mean, what else can you ask for? But seriously, this place is so nice. Volume-wise they are generally pretty quiet. Cool people, cool house. I get nothing but good, wholesome vibes from Linder. . . I honestly don't know too much about Ruths' and Osterweil, so I can't offer much insight there other than that they both have a maximum living capacity of 12 (second smallest in the ICC), so I'm assuming the communities must be pretty close-knit based on that alone.. . As for your PS, hi! I live in Luther! While it may not be the place for you based on noise alone, I'm happy to write a bit about my experience for those that may be interested. I absolutely love the place as a big social person and partier myself. People often think that living in a house of \~50 would make it hard to form close-knit relationships, but I, and most others, have had quite the opposite experience. I feel pretty close to the vast majority of the house, personally. Being in a house with so many people, you can always find someone that is free to do something with you whether it's going out to the bars, watching a movie, making art, going on a random trip, or even just going for a 4 am walk.

So at least as far as the stipend is concerned, my hourly rate ends up being below minimum wage. Yes, I get great health coverage, but so do other wage workers (although certainly not all). In neither case does it make it okay to treat the workers poorly. As for tuition waivers, it's a bit hard to evaluate the value of them. Once coursework is done, we are required to sign up for a conference course with our thesis advisors. That amounts to meeting with them occasionally throughout the term for a chat and if you're lucky getting them to read some of your stuff and offer some comments. But it's not a class. Also at least in my dept we aren't permitted to take other classes during this time because it'll cost the dept too much money. So the fact that the college waives our tuition bill in this way doesn't really seem like money in my pocket. Perhaps we can consider the full cost of tuition during my coursework as part of my pay. But there again once you stretch that across all the semesters that I've served as a GSI including when I'm not taking courses, and once again, my take home looks rather unimpressive. Finally, none of this is taking into account the fact that a big part of what GSI's are doing with their time is pursuing active research (just like your professors).

For example, whether a course ends up being heavy for someone might depend on their experience in and comfort with a particular area of CS. I see that half of people surveyed say EECS 477 is a moderate workload course. This may be true if you have a particular interest in algorithms and you did well in 376, which I assume most people taking the class did, but maybe someone didn't and they're considering taking the class because they think it's an easy way to get better at coding interviews (totally not me). A similar principle applies to EECS 491, which might be just as work intensive as EECS 482 if you don't have as strong a programming foundation as others (and let me tell you, there are some *very* strong programmers in that class). The survey also only asks students to consider the class as a whole, which hides the variation in difficulty a class might display at different points throughout the semester. For example, I would say the second half of EECS 484 is more difficult conceptually than the first half. A last thing to consider is that these surveys don't tell a person whether a class is worth taking *for them*. For example, the fact that 78.4% of students surveyed say that EECS 482 is extremely heavy in workload might be a turnoff for some, but what if you knew that probably a similar percent of students would say it was all very worth it? These are all things (and probably not even all of the things) that the survey doesn't tell you but a reddit post might, so I don't think making such posts is as silly as this one implies.",66.0,neutral,0.7230213284492493

Some mornings, you have more drivers than rides but other mornings there is no drivers whatsoever. The earlier you need to leave, the worst your chances are. If you need to get to a 5am flight? You're risking that there won't be an Uber, or if there is then it could easily be 100+. An example: On Sunday morning, I took someone to the airport at 4:15am and was the only Uber out at that time - her ride was $180 because of the surge.. . My advice: Schedule a ride in the days before during a time where Uber isn't busy because it will book your ride based off the price at that moment. If there is a high surge during your actual trip time, Uber will just pay it to the driver themselves and not charge you. . . But reserving will not reserve an actual ride - Uber cannot guarantee that there will be anyone to drive you at that time. So this is only to save you the potential high cost. So the second thing you should do is schedule a Lyft at the same time: on the morning of, cancel whichever ride doesn't come first and just pay the $5 dollar cancellation fee.",10.0,negative,0.5169671177864075

We ignore computer graphics entirely. It's honestly pretty embarrassing for a program of our caliber to not have a single graphics course. Even our cherished rivals, OSU and MSU have some form of graphics programming curriculum (and both of them are quite good). . . . In UMich's defense, it is a niche field compared to something that is all the rage right now like Web Dev or Machine Learning (ML is actually used all the time in graphics these days interestingly, like Deep Learning Super Sampling). However, there is a strong academic presence throughout the world in offline rendering, with many universities publishing research at rendering conferences like SIGGRAPH. Also academics in this field sometimes go work at places like PIXAR or ILM or NVIDIA. UMich should at least do some of this like they did years ago imo. . . . Realtime Rendering, which is what you see in video games, is sort of an interesting beast because it usually moves too fast for academia or course curricula to keep up. The last time EECS 487 was taught I believe even then it was using an outdated version of OpenGl, an API used to interface with the GPU and perform real-time rendering. Todays graphics APIs like D3D12 are so terse and complex it takes almost 2,000 lines of C++ code (and some shader code running on the GPU) to draw a single triangle. Not very nice for a University course if you want to do any worthwhile techniques.... However Realtime Rendering is one of my favorite topics ever because you get to write C++ and GPU code that's ""close to the metal"" per say. Every instruction and cache optimization counts when you want to churn out a video game frame every 16.7 ms. That requires doing \*trillions\* of calculations per second. GPUs are measured in TeraFlops for a reason! You also get to use math more than some other programming areas. You want to calculate incoming light for a pixel? Surface integral time! . . . I've written a lot at this point so I'll try to wrap things up. If you are at UMich and interested in graphics though, try to check out the EECS 498 section for GPU Programming, which uses CUDA and is usually taught by Reetuparna Das. And it has an awesome GSI (you know who you are). It is a great way to learn GPU architecture even though it is not a graphics course. For more general info on how to learn computer graphics, you can look at my post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/comments/pq0z6k/comment/hd7yhsh/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3",6.0,error,0.0

His output also includes a roster of other compositions that get appreciative hearings in many concert halls, along with other honours and awards (including one of those MacArthur ""genius"" awards) that could make accomplished people very envious.. . It should also be recalled that prior to coming to America, while a student in China amid the country's Cultural Revolution, he was expelled from his university, then forcibly rusticated and humiliated by those wreaking chaos across the country for years. . . To bring his lesson plan to the fore, Sheng paired William Shakespeare's Othello and Giuseppe Verdi's Otello, the opera built upon Shakespeare's play. Both are supremely dramatic works, and for a long, long time, critics have seen both works as having come along when both men were at the top of their respective games. A lesson like this would seem a particularly obvious, instructive one for would-be composers.. . To carry out this lesson, Sheng selected the 1965 cinematic classic version of Othello, starring Sir Laurence Olivier, an actor at the peak of his dramatic power. However, it turned out there was a fly in this particular ointment. Olivier and the film's director, Stuart Burge, had decided Olivier would play Shakespeare's tragic Moor sheathed in a rather thick coating of some very dark makeup. Very thick, and very dark.. . Seen now, it is almost eerie looking through our contemporary eyes. The makeup in the film was clearly based on the rather obvious fact Olivier's character is clearly from Africa (something Olivier clearly was not), and because it was to be filmed in colour, the decision was that such makeup would add a level of verisimilitude to the proceedings. . . Of course, there are other cinematic versions of the play, such as Laurence Fishburne's portrayal, and there are certainly video recordings of various live stage productions from around the world, but Laurence Olivier is, after all, Olivier.. . Come to think of it, there might even be a semi-bootleg copy of the astonishing Market Theatre production of the same play in Johannesburg in 1987, starring John Kani and Joanna Weinberg. That production left its South African audiences either stunned into some kind of silence or driven towards increasing outrage by its sheer physicality. . . As the reporting on the recent fracas at the University of Michigan described it, in our current age of social media, as smartphones are used during classes as well as in the time between them, the electronic rumbling over Sheng's choice of the cinematic scene-setter began building almost from the moment Olivier's Othello strode on to the set of the film. In blackface.. . To be fair, Sheng seems to have assumed his juxtaposition of play and opera would be about his course's contents and how to shape drama to opera, rather than a statement on contemporary American life and racial angers, fears and failings. Nonetheless, this moment of cinematic anxiety triggered debate about a whole clutch of racial issues.. . It juxtaposed a belief that one important task of a university is to provide surcease for students confronting such issues -- the creation of a so-called ""safe space"" (or the lack of it) in the words of one student speaking angrily about Prof Sheng's class -- rather than being the way and the venue to explore and debate dangerous ideas. There is also, however, the vexatious issue of ""blackface"", but that we'll address a little further along.. . An author who in his life has become intimately familiar with censorship, being sanctioned by authorities and even being driven into enforced periods of public silence, Salman Rushdie, argues that the role of the university is that it ""... is the place where young people should be challenged every day, where everything they know should be put into question, so that they can think and learn and grow up. And the idea that they should be protected from ideas that they might not like is the opposite of what a university should be"".. . Nevertheless, the controversy over Olivier's Othello in Sheng's class quickly leapt from student social media to campus newspaper to The New York Times, especially since it seemed to be following the larger arc of debate about racial mores on campuses -- and in other institutions.. . As the Times reported, ""students said they sat in stunned silence as Olivier appeared onscreen in thickly painted blackface makeup. Even before class ended 90 minutes later, group chat messages were flying, along with at least one email of complaint to the department reporting that many students were 'incredibly offended both by this video and by the lack of explanation as to why this was selected for our class'.. . ""Within hours, Professor Sheng had sent a terse email issuing the first of what would be two apologies. Then, after weeks of emails, open letters and cancelled classes, it was announced on Oct. 1 that Professor Sheng -- a two-time Pulitzer finalist and winner of a MacArthur 'genius' grant -- was voluntarily stepping back from the class entirely, in order to allow for a 'positive learning environment'."". . Weeks later, after the university's decision to distance him from class, and then a reversal of that original decision, Sheng was finally back in front of classes, but sans Olivier and Othello, it seems.. . In Sheng's second apology, he wrote, ""of course, facing criticism for my misjudgement as a professor here is nothing like the experience that many Chinese professors faced during the Cultural Revolution. But it feels uncomfortable that we live in an era where people can attempt to destroy the career and reputation of others with public denunciation. I am not too old to learn, and this mistake has taught me much."". . The Times added, ""to some observers, it's a case of campus 'cancel culture' run amok, with overzealous students refusing to accept an apology -- with the added twist that the Chinese-born Professor Sheng was a survivor of the Cultural Revolution, during which the Red Guards had seized the family piano. To others, the incident is symbolic of an arrogant academic and artistic old guard and of the deeply embedded anti-black racism in classical music, a field that has been slow to abandon performance traditions featuring blackface and other racialised makeup"".. . Rightwing publications like the National Review naturally took up the cudgels as well, insisting Sheng's mortification and victimhood had become just another example of America's cancel culture gone mad. Sheng's humiliation, thus, was another grievous example of a famous person who didn't hew to the strictures of wokeness as those who enforced them wanted them to be.. . By contrast, a body named the International Youth and Students for Social Equality saw things differently -- the attack on Sheng came because of a flawed understanding of race and class on the part of his critics. They argued, ""the actions taken against Professor Sheng, a world-renowned scholar, may well rank as the most shameful episode in the university's history. It exposes the extent to which the unrelenting promotion of racialist ideologies -- fraudulently legitimised with pretentious postmodernist jargon -- has created a thoroughly toxic environment on university campuses.. . ""Any serious examination of Shakespeare's play and the career of one of the 20th century's greatest actors demolishes the charges of racism levelled against Olivier and the 1965 production. Comparisons to the racist depictions of African Americans in blackface are ignorant. The denunciation of Olivier's performance is particularly preposterous in that the actor was attempting to take on the timid, semi-racist approaches to the Othello character that had prevailed for a century and a half."". . But the awkward question of ""blackface"" remains, especially as it has been a part of the national texture for a long time. Back in the early 1960s, the traditional Philadelphia New Year's Parade had always featured competitive bands, the Mummers, who spent the year creating elaborate costumes and practising intricate marching routines. (This was something not entirely different from the traditional Cape Town Minstrel Carnival.) The Mummers have, for more than a hundred years, been a deeply embedded part of Philadelphia traditions, and, crucially, all of the dancers and musicians wore blackface makeup. . . But amid the civil rights struggle, that part of the costume became the focus of vociferous protest and litigation, with the argument that such makeup demeaned and embarrassed the city's African American community. Along the way, when I lived in Indonesia, I discovered the old historical Dutch tradition of Swart Piet, Black Pete, Santa Claus' slave helper. Swart Piet came dressed in a Moorish style costume and, yes, with blackface makeup. While the American Mummers makeup reaches back to the days of minstrel shows in the early 19th century, the Dutch tradition is even older than that Philadelphia tradition.",1.0,error,0.0
t1_hi9tywr,2021-10-27 17:40:07,t1_hi9tyi5,t3_qh23mi,"Moreover, white American minstrel-style musicians in the 19th century also usually performed in blackface, something not particularly noteworthy to most observers at the time. This carried on into the 20th century as well, and popular singers such as Al Jolson, in making The Jazz Singer, the first feature film with a full soundtrack, also recorded his popular numbers in blackface. . . More problematically, this blackface tradition has carried on into more recent times, at least among some people. By then there clearly were conscious racial undercurrents. Three years ago, incumbent Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, found himself in a political firestorm when old university yearbook photos emerged showing him apparently wearing blackface, to the consternation of the African American community (among others) who had supported him in his election. . . As CNN reported it at the time, ""Democratic Virginia Gov Ralph Northam confirmed Friday he was in a racist yearbook photo showing one person dressed in blackface and another in the KKK's signature white hood and robes, and apologised for 'the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now'."" Somewhere along the way he tried to explain it as an attempt to show up at a student party dressed as Michael Jackson, as if that would make it all better.. . Now as far as Prof Sheng's circumstances have gone, he almost certainly was not trying to make a provocative racial statement about fake blackness. Nevertheless, it seems astonishing for someone teaching on a contemporary American university campus such as Michigan to have been blithely unaware of the complex currents and debates about identity. . . At a minimum, Sheng should have thought to offer his students a contextualising introduction to what he was about to show them, why Olivier's portrayal was both an extraordinary dramatic achievement and a product of its time, and why the question of authenticity in depicting someone of a different race has become an increasingly fraught question in contemporary culture. Or, perhaps, he should have simply picked a different version of Othello to show. Yes, hindsight offers 20/20 vision. . . For the university administration, meanwhile, their alacrity in ""solving"" the controversy by blaming the professor and removing him from his class demonstrated failure in addressing questions of academic freedom, free speech and appropriate speech by university instructors. These three clearly run through this controversy. . . Finally, of course, the students who felt offended chose almost immediately to protest against the class and insist on that chimera of a university as a ""safe space"", rather than engage vigorously with their instructor about why he chose such a cinematic work. And, then perhaps, they might also have chosen to ask the obvious question of how Othello should be portrayed in an opera cast if the role is sung by a white singer -- or can it only be sung by a black man? . . Now, how about this as a reverse twist. When I was doing research on the history of the Johannesburg Civic Theatre back in the early 1960s, South Africa had its own brush with a strange incident of racial coding in a public performance. The then newly commissioned Civic Theatre was putting on a spectacular production of the Broadway work, Show Boat. Given that show's subtext of racial prejudice and ""passing"", from today's perspective it seems to have been a most unusual choice for a South African theatre in the middle of the apartheid era. . . To sing the role of Joe and his showstopper of a number, Ole Man River, the theatre had contracted Inia Te Wiata, a New Zealand opera singer, then living and working in London, to come to Johannesburg. But Wiata was a Maori, and, as a result, he would have been classified as coloured in the South Africa of the time. However, if so, he would not have been allowed on the same stage with the rest of the -- white -- cast. (Incidentally, the show featured two choruses, one black, one white in keeping with the story, but the stage was constructed so that the producers could argue that the two racial groups were never on stage together simultaneously, thus avoiding a political firestorm). . Some legerdemain with the South African government then ensued and Wiata was suddenly reclassified as a white person -- because of a Scandinavian ancestor. Fortunately, Wiata didn't need black makeup to deliver a mesmerising performance.. . This question of racial typing on stage has become an important issue as Broadway slowly reopens as readers are reading this article. Returning to here and now, as The New York Times reported on 24 October, Hamilton has restaged What'd I Miss?, the second act opener that introduces Thomas Jefferson, so that the dancer playing Sally Hemings, the enslaved woman who bore him multiple children, can pointedly turn her back on him.. . ""In The Lion King, a pair of longstanding references to the shamanic Rafiki as a monkey -- taxonomically correct, since the character is a mandrill -- have been excised because of potential racial overtones, given that the role is played by a black woman.. . ""The Book of Mormon, a musical comedy from the creators of South Park that gleefully teeters between outrageous and offensive, has gone even further. The show, about two wide-eyed white missionaries trying to save souls in a Ugandan village contending with Aids and a warlord, faced calls from black members of its own cast to take a fresh look, and wound up making a series of alterations that elevate the main black female character and clarify the satire.. . ""Broadway is back. But as shows resume performance after the long pandemic shutdown, some of the biggest plays and musicals are making script and staging changes to reflect concerns that intensified after last year's huge wave of protests against racism and police misconduct.. . ""'We're in a new world', said Arbender J. Robinson, who was among the actors who expressed their concerns in a letter to the Mormon creative team. 'We have a responsibility to make sure we understand what we're doing, and how it can be perceived.'. . ""Although classic shows are often updated to reflect shifting attitudes toward race and gender when they are brought back to the stage as revivals, what is happening today is different: an assortment of hit shows reconsidering their content midrun. They are responding to pressure from artists emboldened by last year's protests, as well as a heated social media culture in which any form of criticism can easily be amplified, while taking advantage of an unexpected window of time in which rewriting was possible, and re-rehearsing was necessary, because of the lengthy Broadway shutdown."". . With such questions swirling around, and with a parallel, growing debate among composers and critics about the putatively toxic orientalist exoticism of classics like Madame Butterfly and Turandot, among others, it seems a shame Bright Sheng did not at first grasp how black racial stereotyping might have instigated an explosive moment for his class of neophyte opera composers while they watched a masterful production of Othello.",1.0,error,0.0

I totally agree. rush was such a tough commitment but it was worth it, both for the sorority experience obviously and for the experience of it.. .

If you live within 13 miles of campus, an ebike is a viable option for getting here, but it'll cost you about 700 bucks to build, assuming you already have a donor bike, and twice that to buy pre-built. Another option is to carpool with someone who lives near you and split the cost of parking. Another option is to find a friend in town with an open parking space. Few tenants have cars, but most landlords don't allow tenants to sell parking spaces, so you'd probably want to make these friends before their lease starts so they can claim your car is an acceptable license plate to park there. Using landlord-owned parking spaces on days when there's no game would probably be cheaper. Ann Arbor parking is tightest at gamedays, and that's where most of the money is made, so people will care less if you use their parking spot on a different day.. . Another option: Ann Arbor has several public parks with small parking lots. For example, Gallup Park is cool. Those parking spaces are never completely full, as far as I've seen, and I don't know if cops would notice or care if you just left your car there during classes. Gallup is a 30 minute bus ride from CCTC and a long walk from North Campus.. . Speaking of North Campus, there are several large parking lots I rarely see full up there. I don't know if they watch the cars over there, but it'd be a short walk to the nearest Blue Bus station. Parking is easier on North Campus, and North Campus is well-connected by public transportation (at least, it was pre-pandemic, things are a bit tight now).. . If you need to park very near Central Campus, I'm afraid the only reliable option is the parking structures or going full bike (either moped, motorcycle, ebike, or manual bike).",5.0,positive,0.4941759407520294

I've had friends who've taken EECS courses before and it sounds like 106 is much less rigorous, so I would definitely say its beginner friendly, especially since they assume you have absolutely no programming knowledge beforehand. I find that we go through the content kinda fast and think that some concepts should take a little longer to just linger, but it's not bad at all. The main thing that takes up the most time for me are the problem sets, which consist of about 10-15 questions per week, but if you know the material, then they shouldn't take you too long. I also know that compared to previous semesters, the course has gotten rid of a lot of material and the exams are all online now, meaning you can run your code instead of hand writing it, which takes a lot of pressure off. Overall, I would say that it's not so easy that you can just sit through it and pass with an A, you'll definitely have to study some of the more challenging concepts. However, I noticed that a lot of the questions are pretty much the same, just worded differently and sometimes asked to do a little more.

The labs are simple to do (you don't need to know chemistry for them, just have a helpful GSI to show you how to work with lab instruments). For the lab reports you will need to know some ochem knowledge, but the accompanying lecture videos go over the reactions and such. If you take 215 before 216, you'll have a bunch of freshies looking to you for help because they assume you know 215 material xD. So far we've performed Acetylations/Oxidations/Reductions/Wittig Rxns, and will be doing an Aldol rxn next. These are all going to be a nice review from 215. Do keep in mind that, IMO, the main objective of the class is to get good at spectroscopic (i.e. IR/NMR) and purifying techniques (recrystallization/extraction)...not so much a focus on the nitty gritty rxns themselves. So, I wouldn't say the lab relies heavily on 215 concepts. . . We had our first exam today. I must say...one Q involved an oxidation rxn not covered in the lab course yet (Swern \~ covered in 215) so I lucked out by knowing what the reagents did xD. . . I can't compare the difficulty of 211 and 216 because I took 211 in Fall '20 online...and the Honors section at that....which was a helluva lot easier than regular 211. Online version just made it more of a breeze. However, as a gauge on difficulty of 216, a lot of students in my section are taking 18 credits and complain a lot more about things outside of 216 than about 216 itself (other than 216 being right before 215 exams).",2.0,neutral,0.5397610068321228

Luckily the semester is not over yet, so you probably have options.. . Do 3 things right now:. . 1. Meet with your professor asap on video or in person (literally today if you can), let them know you're struggling and would like to discuss your situation. Confirm your current grades with them, what your overall grade is right now, and what scores you would need on remaining assignments to pass the course. Ask about the coaching program, and if you can still sign up for it - and sign up for it!. . 2. Meet with a CS Advisor (ASAP, if nothing is available online to sign up for, see if you can drop-in to the office in BBB). Discuss what your options and consequences are for continuing the course and not passing, as well as dropping now/retaking this course, refer to meeting/grade info from (1). Figure out 2 schedules (try lighter loads), for next semester so you are prepared if you don't pass and need to adjust your backpack/enrollment. Ask about any other mentoring/tutoring programs available to you - and sign up if you vibe with that. Set up another appointment with your advisor while you are with them to check back in in 2-3 weeks.. . 3. Set up a plan for project 4 (today). See [*] for an example plan of what I did my 2nd time around in eecs 280, but feel free to make your own kind of plan, but do make one! If you don't know where to start for making a plan, try to do it with your professor when you meet with them, or with a coach/mentor.. .

Check the office hours calendar and make sure there is an office hour time you can make before each chunk due-date (you don't have to go to these office hours, but it's good to have them scheduled if you need them).

Black students rightfully expressed their concern to the administration, who failed to proactively work with Sheng and students to come to an understanding why this is unacceptable. Sheng wrote an apology letter that focused more on touting nice things he's done for black people in the past rather than acknowledging the harm to black students of having racist sterotypes and caricatures of black people treated as benign materials used to learn about another topic.. . As even his apology missed the mark so much, those students no longer felt comfortable continuing with him in charge of the class. He stepped down from teaching that one class just for this semester, and I hope is having productive conversations with students and administration about the complicated dynamics of America's racist history.. .

You'll get your MCard sometime like RIGHT before classes start. I got mine like 2 days before classes. You can use this to pay for the bus, but you can also use change. I forgot both one time and the driver still let me ride. . . 2. Go to The Ride website and go to Plan My Trip. Figure out which bus(ses) you can take. I can take 2 busses from my stop to the central campus transit center. They go by my apartment approximately every 15 minutes. At the beginning of the semester, I tried to search Plan My Trip every time I rode, but I found that frustrating as the busses don't always come on time. Now, I just get to my stop about 30-45 mins before class starts (I live like 20-25 mins by bus away). . . 3. Wait at the stop for the bus. When the bus comes, if there are people there at the stop, then the bus driver should stop. I like to give a small wave, stand near the curb, and make eye contact, just in case). If you start to freak out bc the bus is late or something, then just ask someone near you waiting at the stop. Most people are familiar with the system and will help you. . . 4. As you board the bus, have your MCard or change ready, and your mask on. Swipe the MCard on the top reader thingy (you'll see this immediately. It's impossible to miss, but the bus driver will help you if you need help), or give the driver the change. If you need a transfer or have questions, ask the bus driver before you sit down. . . 5. Try to sit in the back half of the bus, if possible. Old people, disabled people, people with kids, etc. Are supposed to sit in the front. If you do sit in the front, it's okay, but you may need to move back if someone like this gets on. You can also stand, holding the bars or straps for support. . . 6. Know where your stop is. Just before your bus approaches the stop, there will be an electronic message on the inside of the bus that tells you which stop the bus is coming to. If there are people standing there, the bus should stop. Regardless, you need to pull any yellow cord anywhere in the bus to let the driver know that you need to get off. If someone else pulls it first, then you don't need to pull it again. . . 7. Get off the bus. Preferably out of the back side door. But if you happen to be sitting near the front, then you can get off out of the front door too. . . That's it! Let me know if you have any other questions! If you're really stressing, you can totally ride the bus with me one day. I have terrible anxiety, so I get it. It's stressful the first few times, but once you know your route it's actually really nice to ride the bus. I hate driving and it's better for the environment.

The sweetland minor, unlike the creative writing minor, is focused more on professional writing. It's very flexible. Gateway and capstone are project based and self guided, so you get to do a writing project on a topic of your choice -- and it's a very broad definition of writing. We had people in my capstone who did screenplays, writing music, essays, blogs, podcasts, interviews, children's books, poetry etc, A big part of the minor too is taking two ULWR classes of your choice, one outside your major. I have heard from some people who did the minor from non-LSA majors that this aspect was annoying, but I was in LSA and it wasn't too difficult since you have to take an ULWR anyway, I just took one in my major and then another elective class that seemed interesting, there are a lot in the English department. I took English 325 as my ""skills class"" requirement which I enjoyed.. . The classes aren't necessarily difficult but they are a lot of writing and you have to be able to keep up with your project in capstone especially. I didn't think that capstone was more work than the other classes I was taking my senior year but it did require a different type of time management.. . The writing minor is small and everyone takes gateway and capstone. The people in my capstone got really close and we had a little party at the end of the semester. I also really liked my professor that I had for both gateway and capstone.. . Another thing to keep in mind is most people who do the sweetland minor are looking to do some sort of writing-adjacent career. Most of the people in my capstone were going into something like marketing, PR, journalism, law, entertainment industry etc. So if you're a STEM major you may not find a lot of other STEM kids -- but maybe you're ok with that.. .

As for the workload, we currently have 2 1-1.5 hour lectures each week as well as one 50 minute discussion section, and the HW is 2 (typically 30-40 page) readings per week. Sometimes, there is a discussion post you have to write on some important concept from the readings/discussion, but those don't take very long (paragraph or two max). In theory, this doesn't sound too hard, but what I would say is that in order to get an A in the class you have to do the readings and watch the lectures really carefully, because the tests (in-person, in the lecture hall) will ask *very specific* questions from both the readings and the lectures (for example, **what specific example does the professor use to illustrate \[insert concept here\]**), and you can't just solve these questions by process of elimination either. If you're a slow reader or not good at skimming, this might pose a bit of a problem. . . . .

I'll combat your anecdote with another, I have never met a 4.0 student who doesn't take random easy classes to boost their credit number. Being a good student doesn't get you a 4.0, you have to be chasing the 4.0. In plenty of classes, there will be arbitrary assignments that you will have to waste huge amounts of time on if you want to ensure an A. The only thing that distinguishes a 4.0 student from a 3.9X is either the decision to pass/fail some courses or the excess free time to spend 50% more time doing pointless work. . . My problem with the ethos of the '4.0 student' is that it rewards people who are trying to play a different game. You don't get a 4.0 for having a passion or desire to learn a subject by taking as many courses as possible, in that case, you will have to eventually hit a wall where you cannot spend an adequate amount of time in every class to get an A. In my own personal experience, I have never taken a non-technical course here, have taken 18 credits every semester, and have only gotten two grades below an A, A-'s in EECS 280 and 203. I didn't have time to spend checking over my homework in 203 second semester, nor the time to max out my points for 280 projects my first semester. However, when I took 281 over the following summer when I had more free time, I got an A+. . .

I'm going to try my best to articulate a coherent response, and hopefully give you some sage advice/things to think about. The goal of this response is to quell any anxiety you have regarding the time value of your money while shedding light on why things are, the way they are.. . To start, academic institutions take on a form that looks very similar to a manufacturing process. Institutions design lesson plans with the intention of implementing successive, incremental learning for each leg of a student's college career. While every institution does things differently, the formula is more, or less, the same. . . While navigating the institutions design, it's not important to retain the information. Straight up, 90% of the material you learn in school is completely useless. The point of academics is not learn the material, but rather, to learn HOW to learn the material.. . With this in mind, I would argue that the university's system is working exactly how it was designed. You're struggling (whatever that means for you) which is forcing you to find alternative paths to success. You, and others, have pointed the many potential strategies to succeed in Calc i.e., you learned how to learn the material in a way that works for you, and then found a way to beat the system.. . Tangentially, you keep throwing around the amount of money you spend as an out-of-state student. I recognize that it's no small amount and there are a number of long and short term consequences as a result. . . However, personally, I would rather spend my money here than anywhere else. I imagine you had a plethora of choices when it came to selecting a college to attend, and you chose Michigan (Great choice, btw, so lovely to have you ). You clearly have a vision for your life far above and beyond the average person, and I commend you for that. I think deep down you also know that is why you came here. For me, wearing the block M is empowering. We are willing to do what others will not. We rail against limitations to achieve the unfathomable because that's how we're wired. This feeling of pride stems from knowing that I'm surrounded by a community of other powerful minds and hearts who align with my values (albeit a nervous, socially awkward, but well intentioned community. Generally speaking, of course). That's pretty fucking sick, if you ask me.. . Whenever I'm having a shitty day, I think about all the kids who would KILL to be in my position but didn't get their opportunity. My choice to attend means that someone else equally as qualified did not. Therefore, there is an unspoken, unwritten contract between those who have and those who do not; there is an obligation to find a fucking way, period. I know people who would give up EVERYTHING to come here, no matter the cost, because they know price of admission far outweighs the alternative. . . In life, and in death, we walk alone. But, we march forward nonetheless. One step at a time. Swinging one leg in front of the other. While my GSI's could mathematically explain the mechanics behind the movement, they certainly aren't helping me power the motion. I wouldn't left them, but I'm also a prideful, stubborn fuck.. .

There's an abundance of research opportunities, especially in medicine, at both schools.. .

t1_hjwlkja,2021-11-09 05:57:20,t3_qnhe2o,t3_qnhe2o,"I graduated with the honors math major + a masters through CUGS in 2020 (class number 41!) and took the full honors sequence, plus a few graduate classes. I'm currently pursuing my PhD in math at a top program I love, so the TLDR of my rant is that everything worked out in the end.. . I wholeheartedly agree with your assessment; it feels concise yet somehow complete. I will say that your point about professors picking a few ""golden children"" from the honors math sequence and putting them up on a pedestal 100% does happen. The system is very hierarchical; I got some more opportunities handed my way (an REU for example) since I took the honors sequence in full; those would be harder to get if you didn't do this.. . . . On the other hand, there were a number of honors math kids (people who, for the most part, were quite a bit smarter and worked harder than I did) that got spoon-fed opportunities. A good chunk of undergraduate awards and scholarships, for example, are purely a favoritism game played by certain faculty. I knew of someone (who is a great mathematician! I don't want to take away from them) who won an award in field A (say, Analysis) without having taken a single class in field A outside of the honors sequence, doing any research in the field, or particular caring about the field at all. They just happened to be in the good graces of a certain professor, who nominated/gave them the award, as well as the stipend associated with it. I can think of at least 6 other examples off the top of my head where someone received an award/opportunity/recommendation over other candidates for similar reasons (or lack thereof), but I don't want to disparage anyone and/or make the response so pointed that people could figure out they were mentioned. As someone who has graded 295 you are particularly aware of this; that's one of the most coveted grading roles in the department (high pay + high hours) and you clearly earned it, but you probably did get on the good side of Stephen/Sarah. For what it's worth, of all the people I've seen grading the honors sequence, they are currently getting their PhDs at UChicago, Stanford (x3), Berkeley, UIC (x2), Harvard, Princeton, or work at facebook/google, so you are in good company.. . . . The point is that there is certainly favoritism within the department, and one does need to ""play the game"" (do volunteering things, math circles, interact with certain professors, etc.) to get ahead and get these opportunities, honors math or not. There is also a culture of being ""volun-told"" to do something, due the ""implication"" that not doing so might reflect poorly on your chances of getting a rec letter for graduate school from the person asking a ""favor"" of you. I know of someone who had to be at the math building by 6:30AM on a Saturday with 12 hours notice, just because they were asked to by a professor and couldn't feel like they could say no.. . As you mentioned, Sexism is pretty common as well. I know of an instance where a group of undergrads were invited on a whim to a graduate student welcome dinner within the department. They were invited to answer questions about what it was like to study math at Michigan and comment on their experiences as undergrads. That group of undergrads consisted entirely of underclassman, female honors math majors (the 4-5 of them consisted of 80% of the women fitting that description, I should add). I wonder why they specifically were invited? Perhaps they should have been warned that they'd be tokenized for ""appearances"".. . . . This is not to take away from the academic quality of the department, though: I have been on the receiving end of at least a little bit of this ""pointed focus"" towards future graduate students, and the honors math sequence (as well as a number of the professors in the department) prepared me for graduate school more than any other life experience I've had. I have had wonderful experiences with a number of professors, and honestly credit a couple of them for getting me into graduate school at all. I just think that these sort of things should have been fixed (if they haven't already; a lot happens in 1-2 years), and I'm sad I didn't do much to shine a light to this while I was an undergrad (honors math does keep you busy, as you know).

So I can't speak to the curriculum differences since I was working towards a CS degree at the time. Housing differences are huge, Flint has dedicated residence halls while Dearborn only has a nearby sponsored apartment building that's privately owned. Flint has meal plans and Dearborn doesn't. If you wanted to live in more traditional university housing your first year, Flint is better for this. Their first year dorm is amazing; it's suite style housing, either single or double bed rooms, with a kitchen and living room area shared between another room of people. . . I don't remember the transfer process being too difficult. At Flint we had a contact that we could talk to about requirements, if we expressed interest he'd help us. We didn't need to reapply to Ann Arbor, in January of my freshman year we received an email asking us to confirm intent to transfer by filling out a form, then the process was automatic from there besides sending some transcripts. In terms of requirements, they required we maintain a 3.2 GPA our first year, I don't think we were allowed to fail any classes, and we had to take a certain amount of transferable credits. So if you decide to do this plan, be sure you're working with your advisor and checking the transfer equivalencies page so you're taking courses that will transfer. . .

Two years isn't a lot of time to get established on campus, at least as a sophomore you still feel young enough to fit in with the freshmen on campus.

By the end of the semester, I knew I was going to fail calc 3. I didn't even study for the exam because I knew failure was inevitable. Sure enough, got an E in that class. I knew gen chem was salvageable, so I worked really hard on that exam and managed to get a C in that one. Walked out with a 1.9 GPA that term. Welcome to college!

Thought about transferring during the thick of that semester because I thought I wasn't good enough and had all this doubt. . . But then I managed to stop panicking and learned to a. stop overloading on hard classes b. take classes in departments you have a good grasp on, which is how I stopped aiming for neuroscience and instead went BCN because BCN has no chemistry and c. office hours are your friend...I got over what was holding me back and built connections with all my profs and that helped a lot. . . And socially, I had lots of friends in the dorm freshman year. Got stuck in northwood sophomore year and had no friends but got a place off campus junior year that was close enough to central that I was able to venture that way and learned how to make friends. That was hard. . . ""There's a benefit to losing. You get to learn from your mistakes.""",22.0,error,0.0

Eventually did take 281, but that was already after I got the return offer from my internship.. . Basically, summer going into senior year, I saw a lot of my friends from high school getting these cool internships at these big name companies like Google, Salesforce, etc. I thought to myself, ""why don't I give it a shot."" I had taken 183 and 280 at that point, so I figured I was in a good position to start preparing for interviews. I also really didn't want to go to graduate school for music, because I was a lot more interested in working right out of undergrad. At the end of August, I drafted and revised my resume with relevant schoolwork and a couple side projects I had done over the summer. Didn't even know what Leetcode was. End of November, I got my internship offer. The rest is history. All in all, it was a turnaround of about 3 months from start to finish, which imo is *insanely* quick. In that time, I pretty much had to teach myself data structures & algorithms on my own. Watched a ton of YouTube videos, did a shit ton of Leetcode - hell, I skipped class to do technical questions. It was absolutely fucked, but in the end, it was *so* worth it. In hindsight, I could have avoided a lot of that pain if I were smarter with my approach. Regardless, I did my thing, busted my ass that summer, took a 5th year, and here I am. Pivoted to a whole-ass software engineering career off the back of two CS courses and 3 months of self-learning; fair to say I made the most of what I had lol.. . My best advice, try your damndest to get an internship. Doesn't have to be a big name either; just anything to get your foot in the door. Because return offers for interns are by far the most common and easiest way to get your first full-time job in tech. EECS 280 is enough to get started learning data structures and algorithms, but if you've taken or are taking EECS 281, that'll make your learning process a whole helluva lot easier.

Here's how I was able to end the course with an A-:. . 1) Needed to get perfect scores on all WebHW and Written Homeworks moving up to the final. Don't rely on others to find the answer-- make sure you have a conceptual, step-by-step understanding on how to approach each problem, and clarify all questions in OH. Some kids work in groups & whenever they face a block, they're able to get guidance from other kids. While working together is fine, I've found that forcing yourself to go to the textbook, refer to Paul's Notes, & OHs teaches you how to approach problems in a manner that aligns with how you think. If those don't work out, then seek guidance from working together in groups.. . 2) Use the textbook. Every weekend, I'd go through the textbook to brush up on concepts from lecture. The content is so dense that lectures will never be able to cover the more complicated problems-- Lectures are meant to serve as an intro. Spend the extra 4-8 hours to read the appropriate textbook chapters & understand the example problems-- this was very helpful to me. Then, supplement with note-taking & sample problems from the Paul's Notes website.. . 3) Study for exams in advance. Even while you're learning content for the exam, you need to start prep early. As a general rule of thumb, I used to re-do ALL homework problems, written & web, two times before every exam (excluding the initial submission) + re-do all Practice Exams twice. I'd also practice T/F questions using the end-of-chapter questions in the textbook. . . Overall, I don't think I'd be exaggerating if I said I put in 12-15 hours at least for this class.

If you dont already have Hong as your prof, I highly suggest skipping your lecturer and going to hong. He is a game changer. On both midterms his class has performed several percentage points better than the average. If you dont believe me, just look him up on rate my professor. He has a perfect 5 star rating. He has lectures MWF from 10-11 &11-12.. . 2.) Go to the mathlab. The math lab is in the basement of East hall. They have math tutors there from I believe 1-4 and 7-10 every day. Even if not for tutoring, still go to the math lab. There is usually atleast 4-5 kids there doing 215 HW. On nights before a test or a HW assignment, there will be upto 50 kids there working on 215. . . 3.) Try and ace your HW. Webwork is defenitely aceable. Furthermore try the problems without the help of online calculators. Written HW is harder to do good on, but if you go to East hall mathlab, you will probably have a better chance of doing well. You can check your answers with the other kids there and make sure you do as well as you can on the written. Remember, even if you do below avg on tests, you can still end up in the median of the class if you do good on HW. Also remember this class is curved. At the end of the semester your grade will get a curve. Very few people are sitting at an A right now and even less will have an A after the final. The curve is what normalizes the scores. So whatever you are sitting at right now is not an accurate grade of what you will end up with. . . 4.) Try and do 6 practice tests before the exam. In my opinion, the 6 or 7 most recent practice tests are the best for preparing. Try them without timing yourself, because the point is to learn how to do the problems, not rush yourself. Try timing on the last 2 or so exams if that would make you more comfortable. Usually there is a big group of kids doing 215 constantly in the math lab starting 2 days out from the exam. . . 5.) Do complex problems. The exam will not test you on the basics. They only give 8 problems, so expect each problem to be complex and test your knowledge fully about that topic. When studying make sure you have a good understanding of everything. If a certain topic is hard to understand, dont just skip it and tell yourself its probably not going to be on the the exam. Chances are it will be on the exam. This one goes back to Hongs class as well. He dedicates about 50% of his lecture to straight exam level example problems. There have been several instances in which he has done exam problem type questions in class.. . 6.) Lastly, the book for this class is extremely good. The problems in the book are also incredibly good. You can find the book if you search up the title in this site. https://b-ok.cc/. . . If you have any other questions feel free to DM me. Also remember you are not the only one struggling. At the end of the day you got into Michigan, so you are clearly smart enough.

I have finals to start getting ready for, so I'll just say this: You jumping to conclusions about where my beliefs are coming from is not only arrogant, but ignorant. If you think I'm some conservative hack you doesn't believe this is real, or you just think my beliefs on science are fueled by some kind of underlying political belief, you would be sorely mistaken. I could literally say the same about your intentions. It seems like you're just following a narrative and ostracizing anyone that wants to have a nuanced opinion that doesn't fit the status quo. Also, 5 to 11 year olds aren't dying from this at the same rate that people 65 and older are, or even people in their 40s. The children that have died had co-morbidities like obesity or another preexisting health concerns. This is likely because we as a nation are generally unhealthy and don't take care of ourselves. Even if we vaccinate everyone and make everyone wear masks from now until the end of time, it would be a bandaid on a much larger wound. To give you some much needed insight, my information comes from people that have been on the ground floor of this since day 1. I have family and friends that have seen people die and put on life support, but not necessarily from Covid. Flu is on the rise (as it usually is this time of year), but I digress. I don't typically like to get info from online or some random data base that is supposedly ""non-partisan"". Everything is partisan. Are you willing to be critical of all research that is done (as you should be if you truly advocate for the scientific process)? Or do you just spout out whatever information is thrown at you? Do these studies have a confirmation bias? As for the CDC that you linked as a source, they are incredibly partisan. Not only that, they work for the government. They are going to set up theses studies in way that favors the current political status quo. As for my original point, I have been trying to say this whole time that the administration doesn't care about students in any regard, whether that's health or anything else. The same can easily be said about any large, administrative body run by people that are solely incentivized by money. You seem to be arguing from some sort of perspective that follows whatever trend we're ""supposed to be doing"" as opposed to what actually is. This is why I get my information that is empirical, from people that actually work in hospitals that I trust. And I'm not downplaying anything.

I don't care if you try and backpedal and qualify it, you attempted to spread disinfo. Everything else I said was guessing WHY you were spreading disinfo. I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that someone lied to you and you parroted it - not that you have malicious intent.. . 3) Yes, I'm critical of all research I read. Having done actual research and replication papers in grad school I have a decent handle on how to read studies and experiments and red flags on how data can be manipulated/presented. Most people don't have that - literally anyone who says ""do your own research"" I guarantee has no grasp of that.. . The CDC is collating sources and presenting the general consensus of the community at large. If they were at odds with the scientific community we'd DEFINITELY be hearing about it loud and clear from every research institution. This isn't partisan. You've been told everything has a ""side"" and every ""side"" is valid so as long as you pick a side and stick to it you're just as ""right"" as anyone else. That's not how this shit works. There's the truth, there's you trying to find the truth through the scientific method, and then there's your peers trying to tear apart the thing you claim to be truth. That is non-partisan. . . The issue is you get your information from partisans so you think it is the norm. If you got your information from actual scientific consensus on topics, you wouldn't ever come to the conclusion that ""the flu is more dangerous than covid."". .

We have fewer covid cases on campus in oct 2021 than we did in oct 2020 despite 2020 having a fraction of the number of students on campus and 2021 having a massive outbreak county-wide.

""100% renewable energy"" seems to be the thrust of [the plan](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/sustainability/Documents/A2Zero%20Climate%20Action%20Plan%20_4.0.pdf), and that means wind, solar and geothermal energy with some distribution mechanisms.

I like that some of the programs are geared toward community investment. I would rather the emphasis be on rail transport than electric cars.. . >Include natural gas in disinvestment list. . This sounds consistent with the previous point.. . >Ensure the administration adheres to the published mission statement of the University of Michigan. . It would be more useful to identify specifically where they have failed to adhere to the mission statement and then use the mission statement as ammunition to get them to come around. Vague asks weaken the potential of collective action.. . The meat and potatoes of the walkout demands seems to be a climate policy. Half of the picket signs on the graphic in the OP are about rape, which is not specifically addressed in the asks you presented. I worry that lumping together a nebulous anti-rape action and a plea for alignment with a concrete climate policy will diminish attention and support given to the climate policy and not really do anything about rape in the abstract.

That said, I really enjoyed it. The lectures are fairly well taught. The homework assignments are probably about 70% programming and 30% written, and they really help you learn the concepts without taking forever to complete.. . The class mainly focuses on functional programming, which is a paradigm that really doesn't get as much love as it should in the real world. It's much easier to maintain software written in functional languages over a long period of time without it devolving into spaghetti. Pretty much all of the programming assignments in that class are done in OCaml, a functional language.. . Another core focus of the class is writing proofs about the behavior of programs. Some people may think it's impossible to write bug-free code, but that's actually not true. While writing proofs about the behavior of programs is usually more work than it's worth in the real world, the techniques you learn can be applied to help you design software in ways that makes them less likely to have bugs in them.. .
