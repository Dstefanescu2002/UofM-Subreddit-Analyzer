For everyone who takes this seriously, wearing masks on a trip to the hall water fountain to refill their water bottle and staying mainly locked in their room all day out of fear of contracting Corona, there seems to be at least 2 to 3 other people who just blatantly ignore the university's guidelines and do whatever the hell they want come nightfall. . .

Essentially little to no progress was made towards making RAs, which are at this point essentially the first and now what seems to be the last line of defense against the mass spreading of the virus into residence halls, feel safer and more aware of the university's stances and protocols on the virus and the accompanying newly established rules. At one point, according to another post in this subreddit on this topic, it was brought up that a training module allegedly told RAs to not enforce the new no visitor policy unless complaints came about a resident breaking the rule from other residents in the hall, which if true would be totally asinine. On top of this, RAs asked for more PPE and to be tested more often, and to be moved into the high-risk/high-interaction employee category, all of which, as far as I'm aware, was either tabled, denied, or flat out just ignored by the university admins.. .

If that's not possible, substitute for a safer pipette, engineer a mouth pipette with a filter, or at worst, have people be trained not to suck too hard.. . The first quarantine and going remote was an example of elimination and substitution, but it baffles me how the admin is completely skipping that control with the Fall 2020 semester and going straight to the last three. There are tents and hand sanitizer near university buildings but no aggressive testing. People might think that remote learning is enough, but the issue is that the University has created a reason to come to campus through the simple act of being open (dorms open, not all classes are remote, etc). It may not be direct, but the University is still as culpable by even hinting that there is some hope of coming back to campus when in reality we need proactive and aggressive policies. Unfortunately, the damage is already done, students are already here, but it's ultimately on the University for letting it happen. The last time someone relied on the general public to just be ""public health-conscious"" was Sweden and the pandemic still came. it won't be long until the Michigan Difference stands for difference in COVID deaths.. . Seriously, considering the ""reputation"" of UMich as the leaders and the best, it's ridiculous that they forget about some basic safety principles in one of the worst public health crises in decades. They really should have given us all VR sets and made everything truly virtual.",98.0,neutral,0.7329649329185486

You can declare DS major as an LSA student or an Engineering student; I think the main difference is that the two colleges have different core requirements, aside from the major and electives, that you will need to satisfy. And, of course, they run their admissions separately.. . As for IOE, wow, that's a lot to cover in a post. :-) On a very high level, I would describe the field as using methods of mathematics, computing, data analysis, and other science and engineering skills to analyze and improve all kinds of systems. I know this sounds so general as if it's not really saying anything, but the truth of the matter is, the possibilities in this field are very diverse. In terms of ""tools"" we use, some of us lean more on mathematics, some focus on algorithms, some -- on statistics and data analytics, or even psychology and mechanics of human bodies. In terms of applications of the above tools, they range from design of transportation and supply chain networks to improvement of manufacturing systems, work organizations, financial engineering, algorithms that power various machine learning tools, healthcare operations, diagnostics, and treatment methods, understanding human interactions with and trust of autonomous robotics (including self-driving cars), design of physical spaces to improve accessibility, etc., etc. I have my own specialization, so I know I am not doing justice to the others, but I hope I'm conveying the gist.. . You can look at the IOE department's ""News"" page, which touts some news-worthy research contributions written mostly for the general public: https://news.engin.umich.edu/category/dept/ioe/. . . You should poke around the undergraduate program page, and the info it links to: https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergrad/ and the full list of courses: https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/courses/ioe/. . If you want to take a really deep dive, here are some research/teaching areas, with references to faculty who work in those fields: https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/research/research-areas/. . I know the above is a lot, and not all of it would, or should, appeal to any one person. IOE is a strange major -- a curiously large number of the students who end up declaring it tell us that when they entered college, they had no idea that it existed or what it was, but somehow eventually discovered an aspect of it that aligned with their interests - or sparked new interests. If you are interested in business, and in particular an analytical approach to business (which I infer from your interest in data science), I think once you finish the basic ""methodology"" courses in IOE, there are a lot of technical electives that would pique your interest: manufacturing and services, operations management, service operations, global cultural systems, lean operations, etc., etc. (As an indicator, a substantial number of IOE undergrads eventually get an MBA.) Or, you might discover that your true passion is something unexpected, say, using data analysis and mathematical models to improve health care systems. . . Regardless of where your interests lead you, a double major is obviously a lot of work, but for a student who is up for it, DS+IOE is, I think, a very natural and useful combo.",3.0,error,0.0

If your benchmark is EECS, then i'll probably give it a 4. But to go more in depth about your questions.... . **How are SI Courses?**. . They're very straightforward and coding focused for the most part. UMSI teaches is the intersection between people an technology, so you'll get a hefty technical component and also a bit about how to apply that knowledge to relevant stakeholders or your project deadline. You'll learn A LOT about ambiguity and sometimes have to figure things out on your own (which can be hard at first, but eventually you'll learn how to navigate it.) There are rarely any curves and the grading is mostly standard (i.e 90%+ A's, 80%+ B's, etc.). . **Project Based?**. . Yes. You'll have group projects, personal projects, real-client projects,etc. Again UMSI is all about learning how to tolerate ambiguity and changing workspaces, therefore they give you ample opportunity to practice these skills and develop them. . . **Exam Based?**. . Some classes have exams, some don't. Though I think most of them have mid-terms.... . **How tough are projects/exams?**. . Depends on the professor tbh. Sometimes they're the easiest thing in the world (me and my friend once raced to complete a coding exam because it was just straight ctrl+c,ctrl+v) or they kinda leaving you empty haha All manageable with proper prep and studying. . . . **UX vs IA?**. . IA is a bit harder only because it's more analytical and the answers are more binary (right/wrong.) IA is also all coding courses, mostly in Python, SQL and Pandas/Numpy. . . UX is not terribly difficult but it does require a lot of work in the sense they have to set up user interviews, do UX testing and practice other vital UX skills which involves more human interaction and setting up external gatherings to accomplish tasks. UX (at least in my opinion) looked to be more time consuming than IA. . . **How much coding is there?**. . Again depends on the class but IA is all coding and UX has some coding classes and some human interaction/user testing focused courses. . . . **How are things different online?**. . Idk much about this tbh...i'll defer to a current BSI. . . . . Hope this helps :) over all it was a fantastic program and set me up really well for job interviews and the current job I have now.

If you pulled a C in 280 and 203, you can probably comfortably get an A- minimum in any course in the undergrad curriculum. You might have to work for it, but an A+/A will basically always be doable, maybe an A- if it's a rough semester and class.. . **Overall**, things are more project based than exam based -- generally programming courses'll give you a midterm examwise but replace a final exam with a final project and call it a day.. . **Exams**: can be rough, but nowhere near as rough as EECS. UX vs IA, can't compare as I didn't do both, but my impression is UX was just as easy, if not easier.. . **How much coding**: UX, you'll take 2 basic coding courses, a database applications course, and a basic basic webdev course. IA, see that, but add two more programming-heavy courses.. . **Online**: Honestly, stuff doesn't feel too different. I just bumped up from BSI to MSI and, if anything, it's a bit nicer online in a way -- there was always a trend of people in my undergrad classes who wouldn't shut the hell up in large lectures because they had no interest in paying attention, gargling their lunch, or otherwise hacking up a lung, which made it a lil hard to focus. I'm hella audiosensitive and ate getting sick so maybe those are more distractive for me than others, idk.. . **IA:** The IA path in particular gets marketed as a data-science-esque situation, but it's not going to usually prepare people for employment in the saturated-as-fuck entry level of DS positions and many folk just end up going into \**cringe\** consulting. If you put in extra work and hustle, you can still pull webdev and softwaredev gigs out of it, just make sure you don't get complacent and rely entirely on just what you learn in class if that's your end-goal.. .

One thing to remember. It doesn't matter how dumb or how smart you are, it really truly makes NO difference as long as you WORK HARD. I know you're going to get told this a billion times. You're going to have bad discouraging advisors and good encouraging resourceful ones. This might seem like the end of the world and scary right now, but as someone who is close friends with, related to, and work with people who have been run through the mill by this school - it doesn't matter, you can get through it. Even if things go horribly not according to plan, and you fail a few classes, end up on probation, get honor coded, lose financial aid - as long as you are alive and healthy and here you can pick it back up and continue.

Furthermore, tests like this are designed to test people's success at... taking standardized tests. And yes, that's a skill set, but it's a skill set that you can pay to be better at. These are not good metrics for success in college, nor indicative of your abilities.

Anyway, what's interesting is you can estimate this a couple different ways and they all seem to converge on roughly 0.2-0.4% of the population of Michigan being currently infected.. . To start you could estimate just by the number of confirmed cases Michigan is reporting per day. A reasonable lower bound calculation would be something like 700 cases per day x 14 days (the reported duration of most illness) / ( 0.95 (the sensitivity of a COVID test) x 0.8 (to account for 20% asymptomatic cases that are never tested)). Any of those numbers could be argued over a bit (should it be 30% asymptomatic? How accurate are the tests?) but if you run it with those numbers you'd find 0.13% of the Michigan population is currently infected. Multiply by an estimate of how many students are currently in Ann Arbor to find a lower bound on number of currently sick students. Housing reported 68% occupancy, so a reasonable guess for percent of students currently on campus is, say, 60%, or 30,000. 0.13% x 30,000 = 39 currently sick students.. . Now what's the problem with that? Well, CDC and WHO estimate we're still missing most infections, by somewhere around a factor of 2x - 8x. Michigan is doing pretty well with testing though, so a more reasonable estimate is probably 2-3x that rate, say 0.26-0.39%. The problem with estimating this way though, is that you don't know whether the student population is representative of the general Michigan population. For one thing, almost half the student body isn't from Michigan. BUT, we can get a hint here from the dorm pre-arrival testing, which found 0.36% positive tests from 6000 students. So it seems like a reasonable estimate.. . Another way to estimate is the ResponsiBLUE data, which according to campusblueprint.umich.edu has ""less than 0.3%"" of users reporting COVID-like symptoms. Of course, not all people who have symptoms have COVID. On the other hand, if you wake up with a fever and a cough, your first thought is probably not ""I'll go on ResponsiBLUE and see if I can go to class today"".. . A more sophisticated way of estimating the infection rate is a model like covid19-projections.com. This is a model designed by a data scientist from MIT that doesn't even use testing data at all (because it's so unreliable). Instead what he does is use deaths (which are reported correctly, or pretty close) and some simple machine learning techniques to estimate how many people were sick and when they were sick to achieve those mortality rates. You can look at the Michigan data [here](https://covid19-projections.com/us-mi), but his model estimates as of today 0.35% of people in Michigan are currently infected. (Again, not all students are from Michigan, but if you look around at neighboring states that Umich draws from (Illinois, New York, etc) you see some of them are a bit higher, some are a bit lower. Not very scientific but it's impossible to calculate an exact value here anyway since we don't know how many OOS students from each state moved back.). . Now, you could argue with my numbers above. But the point of this isn't to arrive at an exact value, it's to show that more people are sick than we know about. Also, regardless of how off my estimates are above, they're *still better than the estimates on campusblueprint.umich.edu*, which said on Aug 30 (the most recent update) that the average number of new cases in Ann Arbor is 34 per million people, or 12 per day. That surprised me because, well, I've been watching the data and that is a very low number compared to what's been reported (Washtenaw County Health says 214 cases in the last 14 days, or 15 per day). It turns out they are taking numbers from a graph on mistartmap.info that shows cases by symptom onset date. This is highly problematic: most cases take a while to be reported (because someone feels sick, goes to get tested a few days later, the test results take a few days, etc). New cases get backdated all the time, meaning this number will tend to go up as time goes on! Just to show this, in the day since the campusblueprint status was posted, the number of cases per million is now 35.9! (Edit: I just checked again and now it's up to 37.9.). . Also it's interesting that there hasn't been a new update on campusblueprint in more than three days, probably because they will have to admit there is student-to-student transmission in the dorms now.",3.0,error,0.0

I grew up as a faculty kid in a college town. The college ended up changing their academic calendar over this very issue. When they started before Labor Day, students would move in, have an uncertain week or two, go home for the long weekend where they were surrounded by all that was familiar again, and call it quits and not return (except to move all their stuff out again). This was enough of a thing that the college changed their start date until after Labor Day so students were less likely to go home right away (no long weekend). When they had to stick it out and push through, retention improved right way. That's how big this phenomenon is. NORMAL. Sucks, but it's normal.. . I'm not saying you can't still hope to go home, I totally get that. And I know you're not talking about dropping out.

The difference was AP credit not my college credits. They took all of my college classes (even some that weren't listed as equivalencies). If you're really worried about how specific classes transfer you can email someone as a prospective student, usually an advisor or the department the class falls under, and ask them. They evaluate your credits when you send transcripts, so this isn't necessary. The only thing that really changed for me is that they didn't take my AP lit for the FYWR and they require a prerequisite bio class that my AP covered at MSU. So really I wouldn't worry too much how classes transfer. Having too many credits isn't an issue either because you still technically have all the credits that you earned at your previous school, you just have to have at least 60 from uofm in order to graduate with a degree from them (and obviously more of you need to for the degree requirements).. . Also I think the 30 credits is so that you count as a transfer student and not a freshman applicant. So they require a certain amount of credits that you took at a college in order for you to apply as a transfer student.. . I think they generally want to see that you are a good student, that you're working on prerequisites or distribution requirements and some classes for your major, and that you're well rounded. I also started to take a language at MSU even though it wasn't required. Not sure if that helped my application at all, but it didn't hurt! . . Hopefully this helps!. .

There are some good classes within the polsci department that incorporate coding in R (Computational Political Science; can't remember course number.

In addition to the three latent factors that were identified in the original formulation of the construct (Reinforced Safety, Luck, and Invulnerability) (16), we identified a fourth factor from items that did not map onto the factors in the original analyses. This Reinforced Risk factor represented the belief that it is acceptable to have more condomless sex with casual partners subsequent to receiving an HIV-negative test result. **YMSM who endorsed this belief were also more likely to believe that they are immune from becoming HIV infected and less likely to believe that testing negative reinforced past decisions to have safer sex.** We also found support for the construct validity of the IRTHN, demonstrating that reactions to testing HIV-negative are associated with knowledge about HIV, motivation to reduce risk behavior, and behavioral skills to engage in preventive behavior.. . > The current findings have **important implications for HIV prevention.** In 2006, the CDC removed the requirement for prevention counseling as a part of HIV screening programs in health-care settings (18). A randomized controlled trial found that risk-reduction counseling in conjunction with a rapid HIV-test significantly reduced the number of unprotected sexual partners among the subset of MSM in the sample, although it was not associated with STI reduction (28). Other studies have similarly shown reductions in HIV risk behaviors associated with structured risk reduction counseling interventions (29, 30). In an era of scarce resources for HIV prevention services, an alternative between the dichotomy of counseling everyone or counseling no one would be to deliver risk reduction counseling to those who are most likely to benefit from it. **Assessing reactions to testing HIV-negative may be a useful way to identify these individuals, especially among YMSM who have tested multiple times.**",4.0,error,0.0

Generally the topics are always interesting (I take classes mainly in poli sci and international studies). They're usually lectures taught by professors 2-3 times a week, and graduate student Instructors (GSIs) lead weekly discussions. . - Yes! Every professor and GSI will hold office hours and generally if you are unavailable during those office hours they will schedule a time with you to meet one on one. . - Like I said, the main ""teaching"" part of these classes are 2-3 times a week in lecture, and weekly discussion serves to go over the important concepts and apply what you learned in a classroom setting. - Lectures can have anywhere from 50-200 people I would say, there are definitely a lot of international students at this school so it's very common that there will be students from other countries in your lecture. Discussion classes are smaller--might have around 15-20 people in them. . - This depends. Im definitely not the model student in terms of studying because I seldom put a lot of hours into revising--a couple of hours the night before and day of an exam does it for me, I'm definitely a huge procrastinator. I will say however, that in my major (international studies) there is lot of emphasis on written work (timed essays, research papers,) as opposed to exams. So, in my experience, as long as you work diligently on your papers, that will account for a major part of your grade. A lot of my classes in the social sciences didn't even really have exams in the traditional sense and focused on providing a foundation for you to apply to a bigger research paper. In my international studies 301 class, the ""final exam"" was a policy brief that we had weeks to prepare. One thing I will say is that your professor probably won't be reading over your work unless you talk to them specifically at office hours--your GSI will grade everything you submit, so it is important to know what your GSI is looking for. . . I hope this is helpful! Sorry if it's a bit lengthy.

t1_g44u8in,2020-09-05 15:30:50,t1_g431rio,t3_imf191,"Course! Here it goes:. . * I enjoyed my classes a lot! The only courses taught by grad students that I had were a few random discussion sections and my courses during Spring/Summer semesters, so you should be able to have a prof for everything if you're taking classes during the traditional school year;. * All of not professors held office hours, and all of them were flexible. If classes overlapped with their office hours, every single prof would find a time with me over email which was great;. * Generally speaking my classes were discussion based. Usually a fair amount of reading for homework, followed by a tiny lecture into large discussion/conversation. Quite interactive in general in my experience. It is also quite common to have a discussion section that is paired with a lecture (kind of like two classes in one) where a professor lectures, then a TA (we call them GSIs for Grad Student Instructor) would hold the course's smaller discussion section for extra interactivity; . * Classes in polsci were pretty medium sized, even toward the end. Once I got into four or five 400+ level, my class sizes were maybe 25-30, but since the major requires 30 credits of polsci at 300 level or above, class sizes might be an average of 50-70 or so? Holding the intro classes constant, classes were pretty medium sized. There certainly were plenty of students from other countries, but the majority of students in my experience were certainly American. The diversity is fairly strong, but I feel like it only made up ~20% of my experience at max;. * Studying for polsci is a bit odd. For example, you'll have three prompts for an essay given to you ahead of time of a test, and a prof will choose one or two on test day, so studying is kind of like writing those papers ahead of time. In general, polsci is a lot of paper writing, so depends on how quickly and easily you write and respond to pretty dense material. Sorry I don't have a great answer for that haha; . . To close, I'd recommend courses with Professors Mebane, Hicken, Kollman, Morrow, etc. Morrow teaches an entry level world politics course often which is a great intro to a lot of basic polsci. The other three teach higher level courses if you're into polsci by the time you can take some intro stuff haha. Hope this helps, and again reach out if you have any questions.

I hear about so many students not following guidelines and read on social media and reddit about so many people who don't have the basic common sense that their actions do affect others. Even if umich had the perfect plan, students who are currently ruining it would have still ruined it. It's like having the right tools but rotten wood- no matter how good the tools are, the furniture you build isn't going to be as good as you hope. In this case though, the students can learn to be more responsible, but they probably wont. Was not opening campus an option? You and I both know that whether campus opened or not, students who are breaking protocol to party would have still come to Ann Arbor and party cause that's what their perception of their college years is. So, I wouldn't blame it on the administration cause they don't have the power to physically stop students from partying. They probably could pressure the Ann Arbor government to do something about it, and I'm not sure why they haven't done that.

I'm going to list down the negatives, and compare it to the Tokyo life that I was used to, and I intentionally do that because I think others have mentioned the pros.. . 1. Compared to Tokyo the public transportation is poor (perhaps this applies to most other areas in the US too other than NYC). This means, say you want to take martial arts classes, the closest gym is a 20-30 minute drive and there aren't many buses that go there. Even if you get off the bus you have to walk 10-15 mins. In the summer that may not be a problem but in the winter, it's snowing, cold, wind is blowing, it'll suck. Basically, you need a car if you want to do stuff outside (snowboarding, skiing, going to Walmart to buy things for your apartment etc). . . 2. If you're used to the Tokyo life then you'll probably get bored of what you see. Ann Arbor isn't that big. It's nice, and there are good restaurants and bars but there isn't as much variety as Tokyo of course. I personally enjoy observing people and things, like what people wear, style of fashion, the different buildings, the cool stores in Harajuku etc. In the winter most people are just wearing coats and it can get boring to observe things... If that makes sense.. . 3. It's cold. You need to wear multiple layers of clothing. This gets annoying because you need to take off a bunch of clothes when you get into a warm room etc. If you like running outside well you can't really do that. There is a gym on central campus (note: there is a north campus too but since you're doing political science I assume you won't go there) but it takes a while to walk depending on where you live.

And the fact that the university completely dismissed that in its fall plan and opened the campus with no prudence is unacceptable.

To help ensure that the mask bodies are airtight, I print in clear PETG at 100%. infill, at 260 deg. C (_very_ hot; significantly beyond melting point), with. very conservative layer heights and stringent acceleration limits on the motion. of the extruder.. .

There is a 1-year master's degree option for undergrads looking to pad their resume before their next step.

Winter term classes seemed to keep students busy, but I think everyone recognized that the content in many of the classes had to be drastically scaled back in response. So if you are going to have academic programs built around lab/field/studio work, watering them down or cancelling them seems that it would have been a huge disservice to the students. I also don't think that UM could have ever said something along the lines of ""only these students can come back"". . . So how are they ""handling"" the pandemic? The larger issues of the pandemic, that directly result in the sh-t pool we're all in, seems a bit beyond their control - UM has no control over national/state health guidelines, testing throughput, community contact tracing, etc. Honestly, the government has really dropped the ball on this, and it seems UM can either shut if all down for a year, or try to muddle through this.

Academically and reputation wise, UM is I think the best public university in the country. The name is recognized everywhere and for ever major really. In that sense, UM is a very safe option. They also let you specialize (Ross, Public Policy, Public Health, Nursing, School of Information, etc.) into cool programs that are all at least in the top 10 nationally. I have had mostly great professors. As an LSA student though, I do have large classes and haven't gotten smaller classes until my Junior year now, so if that is an issue look into your major / program of interest and see if it's a problem (Ross classes and public policy classes are smaller, so it depends). I think academically it is hard to find a program that gives you better instruction and a better reputation at the same time. . Beyond academics, it depends on your engagement level and how comfortable you feel socially I think. I'm not super extroverted so going to a big school like UM can be tough. I think it puts the responsibility on you to put yourself out there and meet people. I think other schools do a better job of creating a sense of community in dorms or for first years by programming activities and structures that help you meet people. However, you can always find that at Michigan it's just that the responsibility is on you. For me, I have been able to meet cool people in classes and clubs and in my hall freshman year. However, I have always had a lingering thought that had I gone to a smaller school maybe that would've beeen much easier to navigate or I could've been more social. . Clubs at Michigan can be a hit or miss for me. Some are too big to genuinely be involved in, others are interesting but so selective you feel like you have to beg to get in. I'm not a huge fan of that, especially the bull shit applications and rush processes that simple clubs will put in your way. That being said, I started my own club which has been a great experience and Michigan gives you resources and a platform to do that. I also did eventually find a club I got into and enjoyed so there's something for everyone, it's just not easy to find every opportunity that exists. .

So far things don't seem to be so bad compared to other schools, but time will tell. . . It's worth saying that in a time of crisis like this, the effect of admin's decisions have more of an impact on the day-to-day than they otherwise might. With things like the faculty openly expressing lots of criticism towards Schlissel, I think it's clear that the UM and Ann Arbor community as a whole are not one and the same with the university leadership.

Versus, in a classroom, you are not moving, so if your neighbor has Covid, you could more easily fall ill because you are consistently sharing air. . . Small classrooms compound this risk because there is significantly less volume of air. Over a 30min+ timeframe, Covid will accumulate more in the air and put even distanced people at risks. Even if they are wearing masks -- masks are useful in short encounters by limiting spray of aerosols, but over a sustained period of time, they will leak through the gaps in the mask into the air (with exceptions for respirators with a full facial seal).",1.0,neutral,0.5990405678749084

Because of (1), those who enjoy (2) have a lot of material to work with--but it requires some speculation. Yes, this university has its problems. But some of the worst things that people believe about UM and say about UM aren't quite as bad as portrayed or weren't done for the reasons claimed.. . Countless times I have seen people complain about things that aren't actually true-- they reflect genuine and understandable frustration, exacerbated by lack of information and understanding. . . A classic example (to pick something not on your list of concerns) is when people get their financial aid cut after they drop below 12 hours, and think this is the university being cruel and aggressive. No, it's the University following a federal law in what students qualify for when they drop below full-time status. The university has no choice in this matter, the same thing would happen at any other university. That does not stop an upset student from going online and convincingly telling all readers that their University is heartless and uncaring.. . I would really like to see UM better address the issue of informing members of the community about how it operates. Partly that is a culture change; it would also probably require an investment in additional staff which is its own problem. Of course there are also going to be times where the university cannot comment on a matter or set the record straight in any way due to legal restrictions. And there are also times where more information isn't going to make a difference because reasonable people may disagree about the correct course of action even when all of the facts are known and agreed-upon.. . Have you ever been a part of an organization that was written about online or in the media? If so, I'll bet that with your insider knowledge of the outfit, you noticed that they didn't get everything right.

The same thing could be true when you're reading nasty stuff written by frustrated people about an organization that you're inclined to believe is terrible.

It is significantly lower than that, more like 100th in the country (approximate) If you look at endowment per student. And that's ignoring the fact that some of the endowment is related to the hospital, and not the academic mission of the University. But that's getting a little bit in the weeds. You are right, the endowment is large.. . An endowment is not a checking account. By definition, an endowment is not meant to be spent at all. It is meant to be invested, which generates income, and that is the part that can be spent. So there's no point at which the university is going to be able to spend the $14 billion endowment. It will, however, be able to spend the investment proceeds it earns on that $14B.. . I think what people may lose sight of is that the university is already spending those returns. It's not sitting around, waiting for someone to identify an emergency to spend it on. When donors set up an endowment to fund research on depression, the university uses it to fund exactly that. The endowment is actually thousands of smaller funds that were set up to buy band uniforms, award scholarships, pay faculty, hire important speakers, purchase museum acquisitions, and so on. This is stuff that the university does every year with that money, like the donors asked them to do. It's one of the reasons that donors like to set up endowments; they know that the work that they feel as important will be done year in and year out, regardless of what happens with tuition or the state appropriation or enrollment. . . That's also why colleges with big endowments have prestige. Not because they are holding a bunch of money in reserve that they might someday use. Its because they're using that money right now to do things, things that universities with fewer resources can't do. Put another way, a university isn't great because it simply has an endowment. A university is great because of how it uses its endowment to do great things.. . The endowment is definitely helping to meet costs of this pandemic. For one very straightforward example, the scholarship funds that donors have set up are helping UM to meet the financial needs of students, Which might be even bigger this year because of the economic affects of the pandemic on families. There are some ways that the university might be able to spend *more* of the investment proceeds to do this kind of work. I think there have been some campus discussions, and clearly some disagreement among regents, about how much it could do. I would imagine these conversations are ongoing. But I don't know that anybody could propose a scenario where the university could use the endowment to such a degree that it doesn't need any money from students to function.",10.0,error,0.0

I think engineering and Ross clubs are similar in that they all have a goal or target to reach, with engineering teams trying to win competitions and some consulting clubs having real clients.. . People without sufficient experience are more of a liability. I don't think even those Ross clubs expect new members to be experts, but if you really lack enough experience, it is either hard to get you involved, or you end up making mistakes that others have to fix later. Say you don't know anything about programming, it's pretty hard for a software making organization to let you contribute other than to help you learn the basics first (which can be done outside of the organization).. . We will say yes we will accept people without experience with a smile, but we know very clearly that you won't really get to participate unless you put in extra effort to learn. At least they are honest with you, better than having you sit around for hours in meetings without doing anything productive.. . Sure everyone's here to learn, but teaching people takes time and effort. Club members are just students, not paid instructors. There are many who are willing to spend the time teaching new members and that is great, but that's not something that should be taken for granted. I think if you really want to be involved, you should put in the effort learning and only rely on other members for guidance, and not as a dedicated teacher or instructor. These are few things you cannot learn online for free these days.. . Many if not all such clubs cannot expand indefinitely to accommodate everyone. There are only so many people who can work on the projects while remaining efficient. An organization having twice the amount of members doesn't mean it will automatically have twice the work to do. When that happens the obvious thing to do is to retain the best members, and that also happens without any application process when people leave because of lack of things to do.. . And there are always those people who are technically part of the team but never put in any serious commitment.

Dear University of Michigan Ann Arbor Graduate Students:. . As you most likely already know, the Graduate Employees' Organization (GEO) intends to strike starting tomorrow, Tuesday, September 8, 2020. We learned only today that the Union will strike tomorrow. I write now, to explain some of the issues we have been discussing with GEO, to affirm the importance of graduate student perspectives and student activism at the University of Michigan but also to inform you that if you are a GSI or GSSA, it is the University's hope and expectation that you will continue to perform the important work that you do to serve our undergraduate students, other graduate students and the rest of the University. Although graduate students who are members of GEO may have voted to strike, individual graduate students are not obligated or required to strike. We expect all employees, including our graduate instructors, to fulfill their employment obligations fully and faithfully and are asking you not to engage in this work stoppage. There are other ways to engage with university leadership, and to have a voice.. . Some of you may not be aware that a strike would be illegal. Under Michigan law, public employees, including graduate student employees, may not strike. In addition, GEO's recently signed contract (April 2020), which covers all GSIs and GSSAs, also prohibits them and the Union from interfering with the University's operations, including through a strike. Both Michigan law and the collective bargaining agreement stipulate that the way for GEO to affect change on the important issues it has raised in the past several weeks, must be through discussions with the University (e.g. bargaining) on employment-related issues and not by withholding services. . . The law also stipulates that this bargaining can take place only on issues related to the employment of GSIs, not on issues related to your status as a student or issues relevant to the broader University community. GEO's strike is based on a number of issues, many of which are not related to the wages, hours, and working conditions of GSIs and GSSAs. However, as noted below, we understand that these issues are extremely important to many in our community; I certainly affirm the rights of graduate students to voice their perspectives and concerns, and note that there are a range of ways to do so.. . Nonetheless, the University's representatives and GEO's representatives have been working diligently since June, including all weekend, to address the concerns GEO has raised and to avert the potential illegal strike. In particular, GEO's representatives have met multiple times with representatives from my office, Academic Human Resources, Rackham Dean Mike Solomon, the International Center leadership, and our public health experts. We believe progress has been made on key issues, including those that do relate to employment concerns. Unfortunately, and despite our efforts, GEO has expressed its intention to strike tomorrow.. . The University also continues its work on a number of important issues that concern the overall graduate student experience. We recognize the challenges many graduate students are facing that may have impeded their academic progress. Rackham Graduate School has been evaluating the time-to-degree policy for doctoral students, in light of Covid-19 impacts. This topic will be addressed in the upcoming [September 14 State of the Graduate School event](https://rackham.umich.edu/event/state-of-the-graduate-school/). We have also been very concerned about the additional visa, travel and other difficulties many of our international students are confronting. Our International Center is focused on efforts to expand its operations, including adding staff as their needs dictate, in order to address the needs of our international students.. . And, of course, our public health experts are working nearly around-the-clock to ensure we take necessary and prudent steps throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. We announced this past week a surveillance testing program to help us detect and contain spread of COVID-19. We recognize that there is a range of views on each of these issues, and are expanding opportunities for engagement and to share information across campus. These are complex issues that require thoughtful deliberations, much analysis, and cannot be solved shortsightedly.. . Let me briefly address two specific issues raised by GEO during impact negotiations - the universal right to work remotely without documentation and the availability of the child care subsidy without regard to the licensed status of the provider. The University feels it has addressed both of these issues. First, we are not aware of any graduate student who is being required to teach in person against their expressed preference. Faculty and GSIs have been treated identically under the guidance put forth by my office. Second, the University recognizes that due to the pandemic there are increased child care needs and is providing support through the CARES funding for Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students ([https://obp.umich.edu/mandatory-reporting/cares-act-reporting/](https://obp.umich.edu/mandatory-reporting/cares-act-reporting/)) and through dedicated Rackham Financial Aid for child care, including unlicensed facilities. These funds are available to all students facing challenges during the pandemic and supplement the child care subsidy for licensed facilities available through the Office of Financial Aid.. . I end by reaffirming my commitment to working collaboratively to create and maintain a university environment in which graduate students - and all members of our community - can thrive. This certainly includes building on our efforts to combat racism, as an essential priority for our university, and to provide an education rooted in the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.. . I hope you will join me in reaffirming your commitment to the UM mission to deliver a world-class education, safely and effectively.. . Best,. . Susan M. Collins .

Second, a law is only as useful as it's punishment. Michigan Law 423.202 does prohibit public employee strikes.

So this amounts to only about 40% of the workforce voted in favor of the strike. As for it being a right-to-work-state and the large portion of GSI (46%) not joining the union and thus not being able to vote, why do we think that is? Some might claim that it is because they don't want to pay the dues (which is only about 30ish per month) and still be afforded the protection. As for myself, I lamented joining (which I eventually did so that I may have a ""voice"" even though there was clear pressure from within to vote in favor) not because of the money, but because of the increasing political intervention of unions that are largely outside the scope of what unions should be doing (i.e. advocating for fair LABOR of their workforce, such as wages, benefits, and safe working conditions). A deep rift was struck in GEO membership when the anti-policing demands were added. I believe that a lot of the people voted in favor of the strike because they support to COVID demands (which I believe are explicitly linked to the workers rights and well within the jurisdiction of the union), even though they were staunchly against adding the other demands.

We've already gotten this through the CARES Act!). A few of GEO's demands ARE reasonable (loosening childcare subsidy guidelines, a weapons-free campus), but the extremeness/immaturity of the GEO over the years is time and again damaging our credibility not only with the university but also with the general public (local news outlets are loving this story; ""millennial academics up in arms about being forced to work during COVID!""). . . On the flip side, the blatant disrespect of the university administration towards grad student needs right now puts all umich grad students into a really tough spot here. It's obvious that Schlissel was going to open campus for the money regardless of what was best for the community at large, but grad students were specifically underrepresented among the reopening steering committees. Immediate extensions on career advancement deadlines for tenure track faculty were given out immediately after COVID hit last March, yet doing so for PhD students is still now in September considered completely unreasonable (other universities have done this though). Although I don't think anyone is being *forced* to teach in person classes, there currently isn't an option for us to switch our course format after we choose it (i.e. if there's an outbreak, we can't choose to go online and ride it out safely). Where even the slightest consideration should be given for easing grad student teaching load / acknowledging our needs, it isn't (We were given 3 days last March to switch to online teaching our classes. 3. Days. This decision was first emailed to undergrads and not the grad student GSI's btw). . . Now, just yesterday Umich admin has instructed faculty to ignore grad students striking and ""work over them where possible"", encouraging umich faculty to openly disrespect their own grad students. . . I consider myself a reasonable person who understands a university is a business and not a charity, but there is a lack of consideration for grad students / our families / our sanity here that has been sorely lacking since COVID, while undergrads and faculty have been reasonably considered / accomodated.

I want to take this chance to directly address some of your points, but also to clear up some misconceptions I've seen floating around in this sub.. . Let me preface this by saying that any labor platform is built from conciliating many different constituencies within unions, and that was the case here. . . The original stoppage platform, put before members in early August, was **slammed** in the General Membership Meeting (GMM) for not adequately engaging with issues of systemic racism which have been roiling the US for months, now. When the policing caucus presented the demands to the membership, they were overwhelmingly approved to be part of the stoppage platform. The policing demands are **not** union officers forcing down ""social justice"" demands down members' throats, but a response to members' requests in GMMs, which are open to all members. They were the subject of intense debate by all members who put in the time.. . I think it's great that you have only had positive interactions with both AAPD and DPSS. That has been my experience as well. I also think that our experiences are anecdotal, and we are lucky. . . Anti-policing demands come from a series of related incidents by police departments throughout the country that show that these institutions tend to be systemically racist and engage in racial profiling. The simple truth is that, if you are black, there is a much higher chance that you will be arrested (or shot) while **not** engaging in criminal behavior, compared to if you were white. While I can't speak for the DPSS, AAPD does have a less-than-rosy relationship with race in this town. For instance, the department is being sued by officers of color who were [consistently passed over for promotions](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/03/ann-arbor-battling-two-lawsuits-from-police-officers-claiming-racial-discrimination.html); it has been [accused of racist policing](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/ann-arbor/video-aapd-arresting-three-black-males-sparks-allegations-systemic-racism); among other instances. . . Membership found that, with the background knowledge on policing, there was enough justification to call for UM to reduce its involvement with militarized police. It's also worth noting that the University itself established the link between Coronavirus prevention and policing, and I highly recommend that everyone read [this excellent article on that topic](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/columns/op-ed-call-end-michigan-ambassadors-program).. . This all said, I don't think it's optimal that we let a huge discussion on the policing demands (not to deny the importance of open, polite discussion) overshadow what is at stake here: this administration has, time and time again, been irresponsible and shown a disregard for members of the community. I think it's bonkers to raise tuition in a pandemic; it's ridiculous to charge a ""covid fee""; it's borderline criminal to have a testing protocol which **public health professionals call unsafe**; its unacceptable to use [homophobic reasoning](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/coronavirus-response-winter/) to justify this testing model; etc. In the end, the GEO strike has the potential to help everyone on campus.",50.0,error,0.0

t1_g4hj7gg,2020-09-08 22:11:02,t3_ip0qhs,t3_ip0qhs,"Thanks for posting this! I'm a black senior here hailing from the Detroit metro area and I wanted to add my experiences here (especially since everyone seems to be requesting black perspective). In the three years that I was actually living on the Ann Arbor campus, I was almost always astounded at how friendly every officer and security person on campus was. It actually took some getting used to, because where I grew up and spent most of my life, we were always told to keep our heads down near police and not draw attention. At umich I genuinely feel safe around campus security. . . There was one night freshman year where I got locked out of my dorm after getting wasted at a frat and leaving my jacket (with my keycard) there. It was super late and I remember fumbling around for maybe 10 minutes outside the building waiting for someone to come outside so I could get in. A umich security officer noticed me and by the time I realized he was walking over to me, it was too late to run. I thought to myself ""I'm gonna get an MIP and my life is basically over."" I think that the guy could tell I was freaking out because the first thing he said to me was ""don't worry, I always leave the house without my coat too."" That really calmed me down quickly, and he waited outside with me for a few minutes before someone happened to leave the dorm and I could get inside. During the wait he admittedly gave me the rundown about why I might wanna avoid getting drunk enough that I forget to even grab my jacket on the way out of a party, but overall he really just talked to me about how I was liking my first year of college and where I was from. . . I think that there is a very legitimate distrust that people of color and especially black people have when it comes to cops. But I think that the main way we deal with that is to come together as a community and learn to understand each other a little more. I have been really surprised at how friendly and approachable the police have been across all my interactions with them at umich, and if any change takes place, I want it to be some type of community bonding that ensures that those pleasant interactions continue.",163.0,positive,0.7183007597923279

Be taught financial basics on a personal level. . It was simply not feasible to accomplish all 3 of those goals if we had accepted every one of the 400+ applicants we received each semester. In order to have the older members invest time in teaching, and getting to know the younger members you are simply capped at a certain amount. Furthermore, by limited your club to those you believe are seriously interested in your stated goal it ends up helping your members apply to companies that recognize the excellence of past club alumni. . I would also like to add the member at festifall who straight up said no sounds like a tool. My club prided itself on accepting members based off of drive, determination, and fit instead of current knowledge. We recognized that when accepting a low number of applicants (~25 a semester, which leads to 80 at a time when accepting that some people will always drop or be abroad) we could put the time effort to teach them if they had that drive to succeed. . . Put differently, clubs are selective because they can not fufill the massive demand. I do not know how anyone can run a club that expects true commitment from their members while accepting everyone.

So, a work like _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ showed the reader the true horrors of slavery, while _Atlas Shrugged_ is mostly a running joke used for making fun of radical libertarians.. . I think that's relevant here, because I fully agree with the OP, and I think that GEO's strike has--while not being totally unjustifiable (since the University's COVID response has actually been really bad)--turned into something of an empty performance rather than disciplined and goals-focused activism.. . And if that's the case, and GEO's strike is even partly motivated by performative activism rather than the actual self-interest of the workers that GEO supposedly represents, then things _like_ the economic harm to local tradespeople _become GEO's fault,_ and not a ""necessary sacrifice"" for the workers revolution or whatever.",10.0,neutral,0.647454023361206

Things like abstinence-only education, the exclusion of non-heterosexual sex education, and the condemnation of homosexuality in general only served to sow ignorance and resentment between those who needed help and those who had the resources to help. The Catholic Church for example spent years campaigning against condoms as an effective defense against STDs because to them, sodomy is a sin, thus homosexuality shouldn't be acted on in the first place, hence abstinence, hence the prevention of AIDS. Would you tell a gay Christian it's their fault they got AIDS when the Pope himself said not to use condoms? . . You have to remember that you have the benefit of hindsight as well - people knew just about as much about AIDS in the 80s as we know currently about COVID. Just the same as how we all look back on mistakes we made earlier in the pandemic, and will likely look back on mistakes we're currently making now without a more thorough understanding of the virus, people made unwitting mistakes back then too.

Gay marriage won't be normalized or legalized for another three decades. Society sees you as a freak. What reason do you have to believe any of the advice given to you by authorities?

We don't get extra class days at the end of the semester because the union decided to shutdown academic work. How are we going to address the shortcomings in education without adequate time? These are the things I worry about. I'm helping out with a grad class that has 40 students trying to master content that we already rush through without academic interruptions. These students are hoping to be competent enough to use the theory when they graduate next spring.

Rackham [has emergency funds](https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/funding-types/rackham-graduate-student-emergency-funds/) of up to $2500 for graduate students. Grad students were denied these funds for finding childcare for their kids, housing if kicked out of university housing, etc. Making the grant unconditional leaves no room for the University to weasel its way out of providing emergency funds.. . edit: specifically, they were denied funds needed in reaction to covid, despite what the university itself says on that website. . . . >Likewise, I have no idea what power the university has over the greater Ann Arbor area's landlords' rent setups. .

GEO understands this! As stated in the [Master Doc for GEO Allies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16udA1M-_ykYJ_2cYQJ_h3lX1BsU7Ap2ylPvBSprZB9M/edit), ""Make no mistake, these are wild times.

Several GSI have discussed anecdotally they either had to get department backing to change this, or felt pressed to not request a change.

I absolutely agree that good relations between the community and its police force are essential. Maybe some form of public outreach involving the AAPD and the Ann Arbor + UofM community would help bolster the positive sentiment you refer to? Like community service events where everyone comes together and pitches in (following COVID of course). I think that building a level of trust between both parties -- the police force and the community they serve -- is what's most important.

When I first got my driver's license, I would often forget to turn my headlights on coming home from after-school theater around 7 or 8pm. The streetlights lit the road so well that it would just slip my mind. One day, I drove past a cop parked in a lot maybe a half mile before my house. As I passed the officer's car, they flashed their headlights at me. I had just started driving so I had no idea what this meant and just kept driving, puzzled about why I'd been flashed. Maybe 15 seconds later I see flashing red and blue lights in my mirror and I pull over. I was so nervous as the officer approached my window. When she got there she asked if I knew why she pulled me over. She believed me when I said I honestly had no idea. She ran me through the importance of remembering to turn on your headlights, told me what the penalty was, and requested that I didn't make the same mistake again. Well, since then I never forget to turn on my headlights even in the evening, and the great thing is that I learned that lesson without being punished and possibly building feelings of resentment towards police as a result. . .

This information was made very clear to us, and for a position that is expected to form close relationships with their building and CCMs, was not very conducive to the role. Remember that CCAs typically live off-campus and were being asked to walk to various communities they had not anticipated (Housing also decided to give us this information within an email that also provided about a little over a week's notice of when we had to be moved in by and two days to make a decision.). . Our emails regarding concerns for safety procedures largely went ignored. The amount of times I have had someone hand me an MCard/room key they sneezed on, had touched with the mouth they just coughed in, or even chewed on is too much to count. When students come to get a new room key, there are many times they do so because they got locked out of the bathroom/are intoxicated/had their door shut unexpectedly. It was predictable that there would be times residents didn't have a mask as OP mentioned, meaning Restaff should've been given the proper equipment to keep them safe. My coworkers received SOME information of precautions after asking about them but were not optimistic. My experiences with DPSS officers greatly varied in terms of friendliness and strictness, so it doesn't surprise me what OP said about their enforcement of masks.. . Through my own experiences and from what I've heard from many CCA/RA friends, Housing can be pretty strict on ResStaff but not on residents. Not good for a pandemic where ResStaff is expected to help enforce things such as masks, especially when some communities don't have a CCM/HD.. . This is by no means a ""hate-on-housing"" post; I absolutely loved my CCM last year, who acted as my direct supervisor. But like many others, I have had qualms with how certain things are run and the overall treatment of ResStaff, which is coming into light now. As someone who is immuno-compromised, I felt as though my concerns/safety were not listened to or prioritized, and the job just wasn't safe. My fellow past coworkers and I hate to have exacerbated shortages in staff but hope this perspective (which I have yet to see anywhere) helps in answering the question about who CCAs are and why some didn't return.. . Much love to current ResStaff.. . Edit: CCM = Community Center Manager, HD = Hall Director",70.0,error,0.0

If 50% of DPSS's funding went towards mental health-, community services-, and rules enforcement-specific training and staff, that would be more in alignment with what police are currently asked to do, especially since police's current responsibilities go far beyond the original intention, mandate, or training of police. Have police do the safety stuff but fund someone else to do the parts of policing that aren't safety related and don't require armed response. You don't need more AAPD because half of what DPSS was doing wasn't supposed to be police work.. .

The RA have now go on strike (which was a huge reason many changed their vote i think, GEO didn't feel like the could leave them after they step out yesterday, which was extremely risky for them as they aren't protected as part of a union).

Reducing 50% isnt getting us back to March, but one thing to always understand is contract signing is rarely happy for both. And GEO + grads def felt pressure to sign and not extend negotiations when the University shut down. In general not simply explicitly from the admis.. That aside, many GEO feel that given the concerns outlined in March, plus the constant summer negotiations where the policing reform was being constantly brought up and ignored, that for the University to turn around and add armed officers for policing social behaviors was tone deaf at best. . It also made people feel uneasy about what moves the University might make next with the police. Dud the University retroactively remove the wrmed officers? Yes. But did they show a poor judgment around use of police in the first place? Also yes.. Given that many think policing doesn't make the campus safer (according to the UoM website, crimes that UMDPSS act on are down but there hasn't been a reduction in officers:https://www.dpss.umich.edu/content/crime-safety-data/annual-security-fire-safety-report/), and the above actions, there's a sizable portion of GEO that feels having a 94% armed officer force on a peaceful campus (less than 35 potentially armed incidents in the last released statistics, unsure of the real number as 35 is the aggregated assaults which can be or not be weapon involved), is way over kill and unnecessary so why all the funding that could be elsewhere. . As for the de-militarize part, that's more of a want for a promise that umich won't be like some other Universities and add assault weapons (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/12/10/campus-police-use-semiautomatic-rifles-increasingly-common-colleges). Police do make a certain atmosphere that for some is hostile and other protective and others don't even notice. So all these problems have been building up and there are graduate students who feel that the University has failed to not make the first one true for them and others. . Also, the 50% isn't necessarily what the union wants, think about bartering. Ideally it would be less but if you start at that number, given the University history at the bargaining table (eg, 6% raise requested to match the price of living rises, get 3% over 3 years), that number wouldn't work. . All and all imho its complicated. In a no covid world the policing demands would have been worked on for three years and then represented with a really strong following next bargaining cycle (as trans health and surgery was during the last cycle, after the union got nothing for it 6 years ago). But they were completely blown off by the University this summer, then the tuition raises while DPSS was cut a total of ~92k for savings (from the 12.5+ mil last year), then the Michigan Ambassadors....it just became a storm and people felt they had to push this for their mental health in the work environment.",3.0,error,0.0

Second, I would also point out that the University never consulted the Black Student Union on this program for their input (which is extremely problematic, especially in light of the events from this summer). [This is a statement from the Students of Color Liberation Front on the specific issues they raise regarding the UM's Ambassador Program.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RNqSBcIaQ5GjGqVrCC1Brt6l5za6hcHpwVdSEHmw89k/edit) If you read the letter, you will notice that the university did not take the input from these organizations with regards to utilizing the AAPD and DPSS for regulating the student community on COVID measures. . .

[From my understanding](https://twitter.com/ViolinMonster/status/1304132167581270016?s=20), the GEO ask of a 50% reduction in funding of DPSS is really asking the university to return that Division's funding back to 2010 levels ([this ballooning of police budgets is the norm](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/12/upshot/cities-grew-safer-police-budgets-kept-growing.html)), and instead redirecting the money to other more community-oriented and non-criminal-based methods of public health and safety.",4.0,error,0.0

The issue that I am experiencing is that DPSS is /already/ severely incapable or even unwilling to actually enforce covid due to understaffing, exauhstion, or outright not wanting to. We also have identity issues tied to policing and having armed officers on campus adds a significant mental toll to BIPOC/POC members, LGBT, and other targeted identities. Even if our police force is ""safe"" that mental distress is real and present when an officer is too. . . Second, Michigan embassador is a fucking joke. They have no power, are not trained in covid response, and should not be the solution to a pandemic. . . When we say refund the police, and RE-ALOCATE money to Community organizations. One of the viable solutions is hiring a dedicated professional staff that can handle covid, who is trained in de-escalation, bias training, and medical training. This is only one solution and I am not speaking for GEO with this. This is simply an example. . . In summary, DPSS historically has not been capable of handling a non covid campus, and gets overwhelmed easily (not to the fault of them). And their job is not to handle a pandemic. The university should have hired and trained a 3rd party to handle this and worked with student orgs of different identities to make sure this 3rd party wouldn't over police targeted identities.",8.0,negative,0.6037163138389587
