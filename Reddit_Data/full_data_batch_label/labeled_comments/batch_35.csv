And I forced myself to admit when I was struggling and ask for help. It wasn't the time of my life, but it was so much better.

Those 2 classes will really set you up for success once you get a job. . . . In terms of resume boosting to get a job, 482 (and maybe 489) has helped the most. Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you know about OS and networking, because they are very core to large scale development and fundamental CS knowledge. Also, after taking 482 especially, you will be extremely more comfortable with programming in general, because it really deepens your understanding of how everything works. . . .

I will echo what other comments have said about 482 - a super valuable class that will teach you a ton about lower-level stuff which in turn gives you a better understanding of how things work. 485 is almost a must-have now, opens up your opportunities vastly, and is an amazing resume booster in terms of technical tools/technologies as well as projects you can show off. 489 is a bit of a dry class but as Big\_Salamander said, networking is also something jobs like to see, but you can get the basics of networking from 485 (or even a little bit from 388). You may have to settle for the others since I think 489 might be no longer at UM.. . Another idea for a resume booster other than side projects is doing some open-source contributions. [Codetriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) has tons of open-source projects that need contributors.. . Lastly, keep your head up!

I hated the culture of umich and especially the dorms. If you don't like the dorms, I highly recommend moving out your sophomore year (makes me feel so much better at least feeling comfortable in my personal space). I think joining a student org is the best way to go having friends, I found it very difficult so far to make them in classes. This student org I'm in (theater) is how I found my current housing and finding people this way is a great way to move into a place for a low price instead of moving in with a roommate you don't know for a high price. Student orgs also get you to do stuff that isn't just school. Only doing schoolwork and nothing else really can affect your mental health so having a hobby or just a sense of routine to do something fun is really nice in boosting your happiness. There's a million different student orgs for different interests, you don't even need to be good at something. Personally I love theater so I do theater groups, but there's sports, gaming clubs, music clubs, environmental clubs and so much more. All of this together made me so much happier my second semester and now on my third I'm comfortable here (although not all the way, still haven't made super close friends yet. And to be fair, sometimes you won't until your junior or senior year). . . Also yes, this college is hard, and honestly I have just accepted I will always be below the curve and I'm among the lower end of intelligence level here. Everyone here came from better opportunities and we're all the smartest at their schools, so honestly it's just a huge competition between all of us. A lot of people here are just naturally smarter than you. Recognizing it's even an accomplishment getting into here is what helped me the most and that U of M looks good on any application, even if your GPA is lower. U of M also has better opportunities compared to most schools. It's important to note too that looking at the professors (on rate my professor) before you apply to a class can make a huge difference, purposely taking the easier professor can raise your B to an A honestly. I made the mistake of taking a really hard professor my first semester and paid the price. But at the end of the day, just try your best, try to make a schedule for yourself and study as early as possible so you don't cram it all in the last week. . . I hope this helps you in the fact that you're very much not alone, and I'm not lying, it WILL get better.

It all comes down to studying and memorizing a lot, after that the exam becomes pretty easy. If you are naturally bad with memorizing, that's fine, but you'll probably have to put more hours in than other classmates.. . Some tips: . Lieberman often repeats certain concepts and topics with his curriculum. If you recognize these concepts, the load becomes lighter.. . Pre-write *all* of those ID terms. Yep, I said all. It's good for studying, and after it's all written down, good spot for memorizing key concepts. You're gonna need it.. . Remember broad, overreaching topics, not specific details. This is more imperative to the essay part of the exam - the ID's do have to be somewhat more specific, but not overly so. Do not over fixate on dates and such, instead look at it more broadly on how it affect a certain region as a whole. Who cares if you forget a certain date or even a name or two - get the general time period, important details, cause and effect, change and continuity, and the right area (like you may forget how to spell Srivijaya, but do not mix up events that happen in Vietnam versus events that happened in Indonesia). . Focus exclusively on lectures. You don't need the readings. If you find you lack information for certain ID terms, then yes, look through the readings if you want, but I find it more beneficial to add more broad details or do a quick google search.. . Other than that, I find Lieberman's exams to be pretty reasonable and there's enough time given to write everything down. There is a reason why the average grade is an A, haha. If you do take more history classes in the future, just know the format of ""identification terms"" and ""essays"" are rather common (outside Lieberman's class, I had three other classes with similar formats, one of them closed-book and the other that screwed you over if you didn't treat it as closed-book).. .

Most of the time, in history exams (if the class even has exams, a lot of them are solely quiz or essay-based), they are not really looking for \*detail, detail\*, but rather if you can apply the topic and recognize important trends, since that is a more useful skill to have than having random dates in your head. Yes, have some detail - you can't avoid them all - but there is definitely a hierarchy in terms of what details you should have memorize versus what you can discard.. .

First of all, I definitely don't agree with the other comment here saying to reconsider grad school. Yes, grad school isn't for everyone, but the most determining factor in your success is your motivation to keep going, not a grade in an EECS class. Grad school, research, industry, CS in general is full of failures- it's part of the process. I'm not a grad student myself right now but I've talked to plenty and every one of them has said that the thing that'll make you most successful is your willingness to push through mistakes and failures and drawbacks- whether it be research not turning out successfully or stuff like a 281 test not turning out how you'd like. I know SUGS is pretty strict with their requirements (B+ in 281) and that sucks so there's not much I can say there, but I do encourage you to stick with it!. . All that being said, you're welcome to talk to us (professors or IAs) about your place in the class and what you can do better going forward. From what you shared in the post, I definitely believe you can still pass! It won't be easy, but if you're doing well on the projects, I don't think you're in a terrible spot. If you end up coming close to minimum competency (ie: say you get a 64 on the final when you need a 67), the profs will look at your case individually and pass or fail on a case by case basis. That being said, I agree with the other post saying that there's nothing wrong with withdrawing if you feel like it's the best path for you, but I wouldn't do it just because of one bad test grade. . . . .

You don't get internet during the exam but you can put anything on your cheat sheet, so previous exam questions, stl references, example code, etc is all fair game.. . - Write comments for the written! Especially with paper exams, we're really just looking to see if you can get the general ideas, not that your syntax is perfect everywhere. If you write comments we can better understand what you're trying to do and that lets us give you more points.. . - Do the lab quizzes in a group and study in a group. I'm biased but I think that once you can explain something to others well, you're in a great spot for the material.. . - Actually do the practice exam questions like you would on the real exam. It's easy to think you know how to do something but blank when you actually have to write it. In the least, it'll help you get more comfortable with writing code and that'll help with time.. .

Despite the model minority myth, asian students are not necessarily a privileged group and still face a lot of (silently tolerated) discrimination. Their good grades tend to be due to familial or societal pressure, sometimes to the point of being traumatic.

This is WAY too complicated of a discussion to fit in a Reddit thread but as a person who is from an overrepresented minority in a collegiate space (Asian-American) I will say that while it's true that we face discrimination in general, it's not really to the same level, and as a demographic we have a lot of advantages within this context. Most Asian Americans (and Asian international students for that matter) come from wealthy backgrounds that enable us to get the metrics schools like U of M expect for admission. And if we aren't performing well in school we're more likely to have parents that push us to join extracurriculars we can afford to be in, pay for standardized testing prep, and what have you. . . I was one of these kids, and tbh I think it's okay for me to be judged more critically in the admissions process because I was able to accomplish more due to my socioeconomic status growing up than your average person. Someone with less would understandably not have the scores or resume that I did. I know there are other people who think we live in a meritocracy, but I don't agree with that personally. . .

When there is no supply and demand coupled with no resources this brings down this property values which then incurs less money to be funded into these neighborhoods and schools. When kids don't have access to new and updated books and equipment, funding for extracurriculars, teams, bussing, or even properly running water or heat in some situations, how are these kids supposed to have the school support to apply to any top university.

I sense that you are taking the Atlas scores at face value and that's not quite how they work. The description for each metric is somewhat misleading in my opinion. If you look at the metric definitions and put things into context, the scores tell a different story. . (All scores are calculated from final course evaluations where you answer questions on the Likert scale). . 45% **desire to take**: this score is not really meaningful when most people are taking it because it's required. Do I WANT to take this course? No. But I guess I do desire taking it because I need it for my degree. A decent amount of people will answer 3 and above if that's how they read the question. . (By comparison, History 244, a hugely popular elective where history majors comprises only 8% of students taking it, have a desire to take score of 92%). . 97% **understanding**: useless metric. FFS you did just spend an entire semester with the material. It would be impossible to say that the course didn't advance your understanding one bit. Most people will answer ""agree"" or ""strongly agree"" when asked. . 50% **workload**: the thing you need to know about this score is that the question they use to calculate it is not ""rate the workload from 1 to 100"". If that's the case, 50 will be middle-of-the-road. The question is instead ""is the workload for this class heavier than other 4 credit classes"". . I will skip the details but if we assume everyone has an underlying numerical response to this question ranging from 1 to 5 and the distribution of said responses is approximately normal, a true middle-of-the-road course should have a workload rating of \~30%. 50% is definitely a minor . . 74% **expectations**: low-hanging fruit, not useful. . 43% **increased interest**: This score means different things for different courses.. . 43% is not terrible for a math course because people have been doing math for years and likely have their minds made up about the subject. I would guess most people in 116 are at best neutral wrt to math. In a way, 116 have to work against these existing sentiments so 43% isn't bad.. . (Contrast this with the hardcore math major gateway drug that's math 185 where this ""resistance"" is smaller. The interest score for that class is 75%). . Now consider a 43% score in the context of say LING 111. Almost no one has done linguistics before. If most people still think linguistics is meh after taking the intro course, I would say the course is pretty garbage",3.0,error,0.0

Figure out the classes you need to take to graduate on time. If you search your major online followed by ""course guide umich"" you'll probably find a page with the outline of all the classes you need to take to graduate. I recommend making a mock schedule of the anticipated rest of your time in school and plugging in the required courses you need to take each semester so you don't accidently miss a prereq and end up being in school longer.. 2. Search the names of the required classes you picked for the semester in the course guide and add them into your Atlas.. 3. Now in the course guide use the filters to search for whatever additional credits you need, whether it's humanities or anything else. (If you're not sure what type of credits you need to fulfil you will have to go into wolverine access and generate a degree audit checklist to see what you still gotta do.). 4. Find courses you like/need and add them to your atlas. I usually just click on a few classes, read the descriptions, and pick the most interesting one.. 5. Now in atlas you can cycle through the available slots for the classes you selected by clicking the arrows next to each class. If you use that in combination with locking classes in, you can test a bunch of different schedules very quickly by hitting the ""generate options"" button.. 6.

The 281 projects are ok, but I feel increasingly frustrated at them for not having a set standard.

Also what's annoying is that for the current project for example, I would submit my project and when I submit a second time without changing anything in my code, some of the tests would go overtime when they weren't for the previous submission and some of the tests would not go overtime when they were for the previous submission.

Second, if you start earlier you might have a chance to stay in the same lab for a larger chunk of time.

It's really impressive that you managed to get out of here in 3.5 semesters with an engineering major. Kudos. . . Can you walk me through your argument for allowing upperclassmen with AP/IP to pay the discounted lower division rate? It feels like you are conflating two things: Credits counted for registration status, and credits counted for prerequisites, class standing for graduation, and so on. . . Certainly, not getting the credits for their registration status means students with AP/IP credit don't get that particular registration advantage anymore. I get why that is frustrating for someone in your position.. . But that's all that changed. AP/IB credits still confer potential benefits such as fulfilling requirements for the degree, skipping pre-requisites, etc. If that wasn't true, you strike the credits. In fact students do this every year with the University's blessing if they determine that the credits were not serving any purpose and it helps them stay at the lower-division rate for longer. . . .

At least with regards to professors now being mandatory reporters, that's certainly one of the objectives, but prior to mandatory reporting, the objective of the university was also to minimize damage, by ending investigations, interceding to protect abusers, and sweeping everything under the rug. Two U-M vice presidents were aware of allegations about Robert Anderson, and one allegedly blocked the decision to fire him. \[[link](https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/wolverines/2021/06/10/daniel-kwiatkowski-gilvanni-johnson-dr-robert-anderson-abuse-bo-schembechler/7643398002/)\] In contrast to that, mandatory reporting and mandatory investigations seem like a good idea.. . While mandatory reporting may be against the interests of victims of sexual misconduct, I think it's a reasonable policy for the university. Both MSU and U-M recently settled sex abuse cases for around $500 million each, which more than 30 university employees (though only one was a professor that I'm aware of) had been alerted to during the periods of abuse, with no significant action taken. Those cases are outliers, but those are staggering settlements even if they're infrequent; even if fiscal prudence were the only reason the university instituted mandatory reporting, that doesn't seem like a bad reason. But I think while that's one reason, there is also a ethical justification for the policy as well, which seems in keeping with recommendations from independent investigations. The magnitude of the settlements was due in part to how egregious the failures to respond to reports were at both universities. Just relying on individual gut instincts of employees whether to say something reduces opportunities for the University to address abuses in cases like those.",1.0,neutral,0.68805330991745

Some gifts do help the university pay salaries, or help cover other expenses which frees up $$ to put towards salaries. That's a big help.

And the governor of Connecticut said *this week* that he wants to confiscate AR-15s from people whose rifles were grandfathered in when Connecticut banned so-called ""assault weapons."" As for other countries, there are absolutely historical precedents for confiscation. One of the first things the Nazis did when they took power is use Weimar-era gun registry records to confiscate guns from Jews. And then, when they invaded France, they used French gun registration records to confiscate guns from everyone.

Suppose the tyrannical United States government is confiscating guns, wouldn't that be the exact type of scenario for gun owners to band together and resist? Isn't the merit of the second amendment precisely giving the citizens the ability to combat such things? We have certainly seen people doing that successfully before, see [Bundy standoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoff). . . If that's the only reason for proponents of the second amendment to oppose registration, then it would seem to an outsider like me that they are also not confident in their collective power. . . Surely you say the government is not that stupid; they are not going to try to confiscate all guns at once. Still, my point stands. If there isn't a point that gun owners can all decide to dig their heels in, then it would seem like the protection granted by the second amendment is illusionary. . . Lastly, if the government is truly determined to confiscate guns, they are not going to be stopped by the lack of a registry. It will be a lot harder to do a clean job sure but to truly resist it you still need the same aforementioned events to occur, namely for gun owners to band together and dig in.

t1_iw2ihup,2022-11-12 13:28:43,t3_yswmg1,t3_yswmg1,"Carhartt is a relatively local (Dearborn MI) company, and has a fairly large company-run store at 5800 Cass in Detroit, in addition to distribution at a lot of other stores. They make some of their products in the US, some abroad, and some materials go back and forth across borders a few times (e.g. fabric from china, laser cutting in the US, stitching in Mexico, packaging in the US). The employees at the Detroit store, when I've gone, have a very deep knowledge of the company's products.. . Carhartt isn't cheap, though I don't know how they compare to the west coast companies you mentioned. Maybe compared to extremely specialized clothing, like for arctic exploration or mountain climbing, it's cheaper, but they're on the high end of comparable styles of clothing. Their reputation is for making very durable clothing, and they're favored by many outdoor workers for that reason. A lot of differences that go into that aren't readily noticeable when comparing new products between them and their competitors, but extra stitching or better quality zippers can make the difference between a coat that lasts for two years or 20 years.. . As far as warmth, I think all three companies you mention make products that are much warmer than you'd want or need for normal student activities in Ann Arbor temps...you want warm but not their warmest. Honestly I'd focus more on layers of clothing that you can add and remove conveniently...if you get just a really heavy duty coat that will keep you warm at -10degF with just a T-shirt underneath, you'll be burning up when it's +20degF, and while you can unzip the coat to cool off your torso, your arms will still be roasting. And even if you dress right for when you leave for an 8am class, by 1pm it could be 20 degrees warmer.

I think the application changes a bit each year but what I will say is they often accept a big variety of students in terms of their interests and strengths in the field. When I applied I was a lot more musicianship and composition focused, and most of the digital audio I worked with was with film, so for my ""remix"" I did a percussion ensemble arrangement and for the ""pick two"" section I made a short film and composed a piano solo piece.. . I do believe a lot of people submit electronic remixes and compositions, and to be fair that is most of what I've transitioned into doing since starting here. But before college I had really only used GarageBand and done bits of amateur recording here and there. I think they're just looking for people who are passionate about music and willing to learn the material PAT has to offer. The culture here is largely about taking stuff from classes and using it in whatever format you're passionate about. . . And regarding instrument mastery, the recording of you performing on an instrument is mostly just to make sure you have musical competency. A lot of people here play instruments but I would not say there's too many super-heavily studying one to perfection. I'm mainly a percussionist but I submitted a piano solo piece because I was having more fun with it at the time, even though I'd say I'm generally worse at piano. The department is also kind of in the process of pushing back on the traditional music school pre-recs that we have to do like the theory classes that focus on 18th century counterpoint. I still liked the theory classes but it's not super applicable material for a lot of PAT students, so there's a new PAT theory class taught by one of our professors (just as an example of classical trained-musicianship not being a necessity).. .

For starters, I'm gonna dog on this class a lot, but I don't know you so I'm sure youre a really hard worker who can handle it, but as someone who is taking it right now with other really hard classes like you would be, let me tell you how it would be.. . . . For starters, the workload is in that perfect sweet spot of just bad enough that you hate it, but not so bad that It isnt always on your mind.. . . . Weekly there is a web homework due friday, and then labs are due every two weeks, so every two weeks theres a pre lab due on ur lab day, then the day the next pre lab is due you also have the last lab's reflection/write up. Hope you get good partners and take initiative to let them know how youre gonna split up work cuz I know people who have had L partners and had to carry.. . . . Also, every 3 or so weeks there are written homework which are obscenely hard and on stuff you hardly know, which leads me into the main gripe with this class.. . . . The course coordinator is crazy. Let me put it like this. Imagine you ran a theme park, and everyday you saw people coming in excited and leaving utterly disappointed. You'd probably wanna change that right? As the guy who runs the theme park your job and pride should be making people have fun right? Well no apparently this guy who's running this ""theme park"" is basing his metric on how many people are being decapitated by roller coasters. WHICH is almost 0 but OBVUOUSLY. . . . . (basically, really bad analogy aside, this class is run horribly. Teaching team is disconnected from the coordination team so that you almost never have a good idea of what's going on, and this class will slowly become the bane of your existence. And by itself with some other light courses you could definitely handle it, but with 240, another notoriously toxic class, I just wanna warn you cuz I would feel horrible if someone else endured the fate that everyone in this class including me feels every day (literally this friday multiple people I was working with on the homework were, not very happy to put it lightly)).",1.0,neutral,0.5478429794311523

In fact you could have another really bad semester or two without getting in serious trouble. Generally as long as you're cooperative and showing a genuine effort to improve, the university's goal is not to keep you down or send you out the door.. . Academic probation is far more common than you might think. It's largely a label, not that you shouldn't take it seriously, and I think it means you have to register for less credit hours (like 14 max or something) for that semester. As long as you pass everything next semester you'll be totally fine. Even if you didn't you would still be fine, it would just get more complicated. Your department may or may not have specific academic probation requirements of their own, like I think in engineering we had to meet with an advisor once a month or something which is wise to do anyway.. . With the financial aid, you might not have to appeal anything.

Chemistry is really just the physics of atoms if you get right down to it. The physics OP is probably encountering in ME is likely to be classical mechanics and perhaps some electromagnetism. ChemE is pretty light on both.. . ChemE tends to utilize slightly less chemistry than most people would think, but its still pretty relevant. Most applications are ""how do i turn an industrial quantity of x into an industrial quantity of y"". While you're expected to be familiar with the chemistry involved, you're less likely to be designing brand new materials or pioneering new benchtop-scale chemical reactions than you might think.. . Despite this though, note that the career arc im alluding to here is merely the ""average"" path ive noticed amongst my former colleagues. Some diverted into pioneering new methods for synthesizing live microbes in pharmaceutical settings. Others went to work as process engineers at chemical plants sizing equipment and designing manufacturing steps. I myself took an even more extreme departure and came back to do my masters in aerospace engineering. I finish next semester and have a job lined up designing liquid rocket engines. One big upside of chemE is that it gives you a pretty varied knowledge base that you can use to pivot in a number of directions. The biggest downside for me was ultimately lack of emphasis electromechanical systems. Turns out i kinda like building little sensors and gadgets. Always saw mark rober's youtube vids and thought ""damn it would be cool to be able to do that"". .

Of course it could simply correlate to unrealized interactions between other variables but that's where you can lie using statistics. Still might be interesting though.

Why would someone choose to attend (and pay for) a place that will most likely be racially hostile towards them?. . Sometimes the narrative is that if U-M exists they will come, or Black students are underrepresented because of a ""lack of educational resources"". I'm not saying that there aren't racial disparities in education by race, there certainly are. AND given U-M's racial reputation, and the plethora of options of higher education spaces that offer an objectively higher level of racial belonging for Black students (like HBCUs, as another poster mentioned), students may ""vote"" with their choices. I know many Black and Brown students that wouldn't touch this school with a 10ft pole. I was one of the two people out of my high school that applied here and subsequently attended.

For example, could an explanation for Black student underrepresentation be that the University's policies and actions discourage a disproportionate amount of Black people (in comparison to some other racial demographics) from even applying to U-M in the first place? You briefly mention inequitable K-12 education, but what about all the factors outside of education? What about the known systemic structures that ease the application process for some non-Black U-M applicant populations? To what degree should the University be held accountable for these evolving factors, given that they don't have 100% control over society on an international level? How can the University best be held accountable in its ""goal"" of promising socioeconomic equity?. . There's an endless amount of constantly fluctuating factors, both on individual and societal levels, that could explain the distribution differences. I'm no social science expert, so please take everything I say with a grain of salt (and please correct me if I say anything wrong / poorly). I think the best route towards proactive equity measures is to acknowledge that the solutions are a gray area that will always need smarter minds and more effort/research.

Reading the law, if the landlord's actual costs for the credit and background checks are under $20, they can charge only the actual costs...$20 is the cap if it costs more than that. Another cool idea is that if a renter provides a copy of their credit check or background check from the last 30 days, then the landlord can't charge them those.

Ideally one with a brush, and extendable if you have a larger car so you can clear the whole windshield. Also, clear the whole windshield, not just a peep hole. And, while warming your car up is not environmentally friendly, be aware that your windshield can fog up fast, and if the glass isn't warm using your windshield wiper fluid can actually make it freeze and worse than it was.. . If you drive and you know it is going to ice over, flip up your wipers. Otherwise you can damage or break them trying to chip the ice off. If they do get icy, make sure they work before you start driving. Nothing worse than expecting them to work only to find out they are stuck. You can also just slap them up and down to break off ice, one piece and the whole thing won't make contact and be useless.. . Instead of warming up your car they do sell mini space heaters that you can even put on a timer to warm your car up ahead of time. I would be worried about my car catching on fire, but people love them. Don't start your car in a garage with the door closed. And if you have an electric car, yay for you, I think every model has options to warm up on a schedule.. . Good tires are sooo worth it. And practice driving in a safe area before you get in to a bad situation.. . Definitely as someone else said keep an emergency kit with gloves and all of that in your car. Even if you are running a short errand and don't expect to leave your car at all, bring a warm coat and gloves.. . Keep your gas tank as full as you can. It gives more weight to your car which is possibly insignificant depending on the car, but you never know when a 5 minute drive could turn in to 5 hours. Sitting on the road with the car off in cold weather is really not fun.. . If you park outside putting something over your windows, or just filling up a cup of warm water and dumping it on the windshield saves a lot of time and is faster and cleaner.. . If you have a car with keyed door locks you might want a de-icer (little spray bottle like mace). Even your door handles can freeze closed. Working until 3am and you can't get in your car is also not fun.. . That said, enjoy winter! It is quite beautiful, and much more fun when prepared.

[BBUM](https://www.michigandaily.com/campus-life/4-years-later-reflections-generation-bbum/) might offer some insights. . . I think listening to what Black students are sharing about challenges and wants is a good start. And committing resources to actually actualizing those changes rather than PR efforts would go miles to actual change.. . As to the question about responsibility, that's a good one. I think within the Equal Protections clause and race as a protected class, there is some responsibility there, at least legally. As to organizationally, no there isn't responsibility per se, aside from legally and what exists within expectations of a public institution that receives state and federal funding. . . Within those constraints U-M leadership certainly has the ability to choose to continue to be a non-welcoming environment for Black students. The issue (for me) arises when there's a PR and performative bent on appearing inclusive and virtuously liberal and lamenting ""low"" Black student enrollment while not substantively doing anything to change that.. . Look at Hillsdale, for instance. They're an institution that proudly stands behind their conservative values and have built a student body as such. There isn't this duplicitous private agenda that is reframed for public consumption for the purpose of virtue signaling to increase revenue. . . I believe, what it comes down to, is alignment between what is espoused and what is enacted. While there are certainly inclusive ideals espoused at U-M, they're not enacted to the same extent.

A W would probably look better on your transcript than an F if that's something you're worried about, and if I'm not wrong the exams in 203 count for like 26% of your grade each, so not taking two of them would probably launch you into F territory as is.. * If for some reason you decide not to drop it, I would consider at least going to lecture and learning as much as you can (unless your other classes get really bad - then prioritize those). This'll prolly make retaking it easier.. * Talk to your professors if you're comfortable with it. iirc after 203 exams they would open 1:1s to talk over your performance in the class. If you think that would help you with it the second time around go for it, and remember the professors (graetz and diaz at least) have been at this for a while and have dealt with students in lots of different circumstances so you will not in any way be judged!. . don't flee the country, don't switch schools over this, and don't switch majors if you like everything else about what you're doing. you were doing fine in 203 before you missed that one lecture, and motivation is hard sometimes! as long as you learned something from this (i.e. that you can't get through online lectures, which is understandable) you'll be fine :)",3.0,neutral,0.6874260902404785

I've lived in Michigan my whole life and while my car does have a bit of rust I don't think it's worth worrying too much. The main issue is you want to avoid the oxidation reaction that leads to rust. In Michigan the easiest way to do that is to *not* wash your car every time it gets a bit of road salt on the body: water is a necessary part of that chemical reaction so unless you wash very thoroughly you're probably just making the problem worse. Also, avoid ever parking in a heated garage (or any garage where the temperature is above freezing), as that will cause the snow and ice that stuck to your car to melt and accelerate the rusting. . . If you are *still* worried, you could wash your undercarriage on days in the winter when the ambient temperature rises above freezing. Given typical midwestern temperature fluctuations, though, that might be a dozen or two car washes between late December and early April.. . I can assure you that you'll be fine driving around on a regular basis. You'll see some salt stains on your car but these will easily wash off in the spring.
