First off, a lot of people who are art majors end up having other academic interests they want to pursue at the college level. That's not possible at all at CCS, but it's so easy here. So many of the people I know at STAMPS started with a BFA and ended up deciding to either switch to a different major, pursue dual degree, or get a minor. I don't know how likely you'd be to want to do something like that, but it's worth considering.. . Second, I've heard some really bad things about CCS in terms of how they handle mental health. I know a few people who go there, and because of the incredibly high workload, they're pretty much always burned out. This is a really subjective one. If you think you can spend 9 hours every day creating art, then go for it! But if you're worried that not having the balance of academic classes to round out your schedule will lead to burn out, seriously consider pursuing a BFA here where you're not taking a full course load of studios.. . In terms of financial aid, I've heard horror stories about them giving Freshman a ton of aid and then taking it away for seemingly no reason later in their academic career. I talked to a CCS professor in high school and she had mentioned that a ton of people end up dropping out from CCS because they end up not able to afford it. . . The graduation rate from CCS is 57%. That's really scary, at least to me. It's like, sure, their graduates get jobs after graduating. But how many people actually graduate? Do you want to gamble on being one of them?. .

The grad level classes in EECS and SI are way better. I would suggest you take some grad classes. The CS curriculum will offer you way more leeway to do all this stuff. Specializing is key here.. .

Pricewise, it also factors out to something like $10/meal and it's just not that great. Maybe get the smallest meal-plan just so you can hit dining halls with friends as a social thing freshmen year, but unlimited isn't financially a great move, just one that's contractually paired with dorming.. . **Roommate-wise**, it can really be a mixed bag. Some people really love their roommates, some people just struggle to tolerate them, and some are so awful people put in transfer requests or move out. My personal random roommate was a nice person but had some issues in the hygiene and cleanliness and volume departments but I didn't see them after that year.. .

Sophomores apartment/house-ing with freshmen-year dorm friends is relatively common.. . **The buildings/rooms** themselves, generally, do tend to suck ass, though. You're basically paying fancy high-rise pricing for a one-room cell you share with someone, communal bathrooms, and risk of loud dumbassery messing up your sleep/study schedule, which can really suck if you get a morning class or exam. Some are just small square cells, some are bigger rectangles, but since you're assigned randomly as a freshie, it can be a gamble with a low ceiling and a low floor in terms of quality payoff.. . **TLDR**: Dorms are groovy for approximately two or three months but have some social appeal. Getting a house or apartment is a way better experience overall, you just don't have quite as many potential friends living in your building. You save a shitload of money.

The experience and difficulty of your research is really going to vary from to team to team, but generally I found the work schedule to be a little more flexible than classes.. One club suggestion I have is the ESG (Engineering Student Government). It has around 7 committees that each focus on an aspect of the College of Engineering (i.e. sustainability committee). The application process is easy, and your prospects of getting onto one of the committees as a Freshman with no experience is high. I found the time commitment for this to be whatever you wanted it to be.

t1_glrhyya,2021-02-02 18:35:21,t3_lb2r0b,t3_lb2r0b,"(from Wes Weimer). . . . Dear CSE Community, . . We are joining together in writing this letter because we believe that the faculty and administration need to earn back trust from students and community members and need to work to improve the CSE climate for ourselves, our students, and the broader community. Through this letter, we hope to express some of the sentiments we have heard as well as to ask for a set of changes that we believe will allow us to work to rebuild that trust. This letter discusses concerns that have arisen about the climate and culture in the Computer Science and Engineering Division and is not related to any specific incident. This letter is by no means implying the confirmation or guilt of a [recent allegation](https://mailchi.mp/9c4b9f529580/dean-college-update-august-students-800590?e=fe7af1728e) which has shocked the CSE community. Our system of laws and adjudication must make such a judgment and decision.. . 1. **We acknowledge that multiple instances and allegations of misconduct can suggest overarching concerns.** We see, through community [perceptions of treatment](https://cse-diversity.engin.umich.edu/projects/climate-activities-survey/#eleven) and [calls for transparency](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/dei/2020-11-19-townhall.html) and concerns about safety, that we must work to improve our entire climate, not just focus on individual incidents. . 2. **We abhor all misconduct.** We unequivocally state that sexual and gender-based misconduct of any type are both unacceptable and deeply harmful to the victims, those in their support network, and to the whole community. . 3. **We see students and other community members who are confused, angry and distrustful.** We do not have any more information about these cases than students do, but we acknowledge that just hearing allegations is distressing: it is harder to concentrate, focus, and work. Faculty, students, and staff alike are distraught. Students feel marginalized, and it is not clear to them that their voices matter. When people feel unheard, it can be easy to react unilaterally. It is CSE's responsibility to acknowledge that we are all affected, and we will work together to rebuild trust through engagement. . 4. Words are important, but we also need to see concrete and constructive action. We recommend that the College and University enact the following, and we in CSE commit to supporting: . 1. **Publicly clarify, provide transparency for, and justify the processes the University governance has established around misconduct cases.** The University policies on certain outcomes and findings are not clearly communicated. Students may be familiar with similar cases in other parts of the University and may have heard of other investigations of sexual misconduct by faculty and may not be certain about the future. The University, the College of Engineering, and CSE owe transparency in communication. This includes explaining why cases appear to be handled non-uniformly**.** Recent incidents may appear, to the community, to have resulted in different immediate responses. We acknowledge the differences in the cases, in the presence or absence of criminal charges, and in whether or not the behaviors took place within the confines of the university. However, it is critical that our community understand how decisions about administrative leave, course assignments, and other personnel decisions are made, how safety is assessed, and what safety means to those who are making decisions.. 2. **Follow through with and expand bystander intervention training with a focus on academic settings.** We believe that bystander training can help identify incidents and support student safety, but we request training that goes beyond existing web-based tools. Training that forces us to have meaningful and difficult discussions about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behavior, and that focuses on student-faculty interactions is necessary. Resources and offerings such as Change It Up might be leveraged and specialized for CSE, and the administration should follow through with, and exceed, current plans for such training. All CSE faculty should participate in such training when available. While this would by no means completely address the problem, it would help demonstrate the CSE faculty's commitment in a way that goes beyond simple words.. 3. **Allocate College or University resources for an outside consultant and panel to review** culture and practices. CSE has not demonstrated that it can fully resolve culture and climate issues internally, and CSE would benefit from outside perspectives. Michigan conducts [program reviews](https://rackham.umich.edu/about/directory/program-review/) for internal academic improvement. We propose a regular *climate-related program review* for CSE, similar to such academic or graduate program reviews. This could cover activities such as listening to students, staff and faculty and reporting findings in a confidential manner so that people feel comfortable speaking up. The review panel could include people from peer institutions as well as other stakeholders, such as alumni, students, parents, and so on. Discussions should include considerations such as what we can learn from other incidents at Michigan (e.g., in other units or departments) as well as best practices from our peer institutions. The administration should commit to making the reported findings public. . 5. The burden is on CSE to restore trust, and **there are steps we can take if we have the collective will**. . . We welcome signatures and feedback from our community and our allies. Complete this form \[link removed\] if you would like to have your name added to this list, if you would like to be listed anonymously, or if you would like to leave an anonymous comment. However, there are many reasons why someone might not sign this letter, including time constraints or a desire to reach out through other means or activities. . .

I consider myself an above average student, but I have a bad procrastinating habit, and I definitely plan to party in college, so would I fall way behind at Ross? . . 4. Is a frat the only way for an underclassman guy to party at UMich? Im not apposed to joining one but Im just wondering if thats the only option. Also are the frat guys generally chill?. . 5. I was the student manager for my schools basketball team and I was wondering how possible it would be to become a student manager for Michigan basketball. Are they recruited or is there some way of applying or signing up? I couldn't find anything online. . . 6. Lastly, would I be kicking myself if I don't attend UMich.

Sometimes it's also hard to find problems covering a section without seeing material from later sections as well. If you are finding that to be the case with a section, book problems could be a good idea there too.. . Review your THW thoroughly as well. Try to redo them on your own and ask your instructor about possible variants on the problems. It often aligns with the exams quite closely even apart from the one problem they tell you to expect in advance.. . Another thing you may be doing this already, but I think one of the most important things with exam problems is to make sure that you are actually doing the problems instead of just reading the solutions, which is a mistake that I unfortunately think many people make in this class. If you are sufficiently prepared for the exam, the time it takes to do each problem should be around the point total of the problem, so you should sincerely work on that problem for at least that long before looking at solutions or really even asking for help for maximal benefit.",3.0,neutral,0.5393550992012024
t1_gm34lm9,2021-02-05 05:55:13,t3_lcu6v9,t3_lcu6v9,"tl;dr do you like only beepboop or math/stats/flex classes, what did you come in with when you transferred, find a way to get the math you need into your program, you can do both and it'd probably work out well enough if you do what you need to do, I've used this to procrastinate way too much.. . . I feel like I've definitely written this before. It's definitely been brought up on the subreddit recently, and looking at other threads could be useful. Your situation is a little different, however, and u/_BearHawk makes some great points in this thread that haven't really been talked about before. Here are some more of my thoughts.. . ## Flexibility. . The data science major indeed has a lot more flexibility, and lets you take quite a few different paths that may or may not take you on a grand tour throughout the math/stats/econ/CS departments at U-M by the time you graduate. It definitely makes double majoring easier.. . There's also that if you're in LSA, the stats department, much like the math department, is MUCH, MUCH easier to negotiate with than the EECS department. I've heard in an advising appointment that ""if something seems dumb, we can definitely find a workaround,"" which was music to my ears. This isn't something many people think about when picking a major, but at least in my experience, has been really, really, really useful. If you're in engineering though, tough luck.. . You'd probably be able to talk them into letting you do EECS 545 instead of STATS 415 or EECS 445, which can be really nice. I've heard the CS department lets you do that too, but I've also been told that you'd have to make up the extra credit somehow. I'd definitely recommend that over the other two. STATS 415, in particular, does teach you statistical learning which depending on who you ask IS machine learning, but I don't think you'd get as much exposure to neural nets -- which may be what you're looking for.. . ## Criticisms. . That said, some may say of the data science major is that it seems like a hodgepodge of classes from many different departments. There aren't any ""true"" data science classes that aren't rebranded stats classes here. While some of these rebranded stats classes certainly do suffice because they are very very applied (like STATS 306 and 415), it's not exactly the interdisciplinary approach some may expect from a class on data science, and at least for 306, can feel very mechanical. I'm not sure if it ever teaches you very much ""data science"", but it certainly gives you enough of the foundations to do something about it.. . There's also that people have complained in the past about the data science major not being all that flexible due to one kink in the program, namely that ""More than 75% of the approved ds application electives do not exist/are not offered."" ([https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/k0etoe/delete\_data\_science\_major/](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/k0etoe/delete_data_science_major/)) It's not been a huge problem in my experience, but YMMV.. . I've also heard some rumblings that the DS major isn't held in as high regard as CS is by employers, but I've also heard that it doesn't really matter. I can't claim to know too much about this, I'd ask recruiters or maybe even faculty about it. Then again, if you're going to grad school, it should matter slightly less as I'm pretty sure they care more about whether you fill admission requirements and are more likely to care about what's on your transcript (literally one of the blurbs on this page says ""many of our applicants get the necessary experience without majoring in CS"" [https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-phd.html](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-phd.html)), though I'd definitely ask about it.. . ## Transferring from another school. . In your specific situation, it really depends on what classes you came in with. As a transfer student, you have less time, and both majors are fairly difficult or large, to begin with. CS-LSA is smaller, with 27 credits on top of EECS 203, and EECS 280. DS says 42 credits but includes EECS 203 and 280 in them while excluding the additional prerequisites of calc III and linear algebra. A factor that may swing the needle in one direction over the other is whether you have to play catch-up in any area, as waiting a year before you can get started on the upper-levels is not fun at all. I can't say much more about this without knowing more.. . ## Graduate school. . Your desire to go to grad school also changes things a little. I'd think that the math and stats classes the DS major would have you take would help more than EECS 370/376, but a quick google search shows that Carnegie Mellon wanted ""a solid understanding of complexity theory."" I'm not sure if this means EECS 376, or whether you'd be able to skate by with EECS 281, or even whether this is representative of most schools. I haven't looked into that much yet, and would probably ask some faculty about this.. . That said, the same page says ""at least one year of college-level probability and statistics, as well as matrix algebra and multivariate calculus."" If you're in LSA, only the data science major makes you do this -- if you do end up doing CS, you'd have to do all that on the side. If you do end up doing CS, a math minor may help (though I'm not sure if it'd be possible given that you're a transfer student and have fewer semesters). It's only 3 more classes after linear algebra and calc III, after all. But if you wanted to do work in industry, I hear the CS + applied stats minor combo being touted all the time.. . ## Why not CS and applied stats?. . Which is the other elephant in the room. Most other criticisms I hear of DS come from CS majors wondering why anyone would pick DS over CS and an applied stats minor. That's certainly a very good program, especially for someone wanting to go into industry. It however can leave holes in the math/stats education of the population of anyone who isn't an engineer forced to take calc III and linear algebra, which are absolutely crucial for anything machine learning that isn't ""import torch"". The data science major does help in that regard.. . As the CS major is very much more focused on, well, CS, in your specific case I'm not sure if it would give you enough of the mathematical or statistical foundations necessary to do grad school in ML without a math minor or you taking additional math (or even stats) classes. If you have the time to do that, it can definitely work better though.. . ## tl;dr. . tl;dr do you like only beepboop or math/stats/flex classes, what did you come in with when you transferred, find a way to get the math you need into your program, you can do both and it'd probably work out well enough if you do what you need to do, I've used this to procrastinate way too much",6.0,error,0.0

I have three pieces of advice:. . 1) Work on your mentality. Realize that you would not have been admitted unless the admissions committee knew you had the potential to be successful at UofM. Some things I told myself were: if it were easy, admission wouldn't be so selective. EXPECT to be challenged. You can bet your ass your peers are being challenged even if they might not be showing it in your breakout sessions. . . 2) Though it is Covid times, it is so much better if you do not ""struggle"" on your own. Make friends in your classes and you'll very quickly realize you are not the only one being challenged. Moreover, your peers are more accepting than you think and struggling together makes it not seem as difficult as if you were in it alone. . . 3) Do the work. Do the goddamn readings. Lectures are meant to supplement readings because of the limited time lectures are. Textbooks often have subtle details and give you the repetition needed with the material to truly absorb the content and give you confidence in your understanding. I did it, I see it with my students too, just depending on what covered in lectures. It's the ""Sparknotes"" but it's not going to give you legitimate understanding. You wanna take the shortcut, fine, you'll deal with the consequences. Repetition matters more than you think.. . Final thought: If you want the be the reason for your struggle because of laziness not doing the readings, that's completely on you and not on you ""not belonging."" Not belonging is because of uncontrolled factors; these are factors you can totally control with improved study habits, which you may not all know right away but with help from your peers, GSIs, and DEFINITELY ask your profs, you'll get better.

If I recall correctly there isn't a way to quit the program once committed unless you want to tank your GPA (or is it just getting an incomplete? I'm pretty sure it's the former). . . This is why for the life of me I would NEVER recommend the MDP program to anyone. Most of the people I know who did MDP hated it, be it faculty research or a industry sponsored program. . . You have to do these bullshit presentations one after the other that you don't really have time to do the task you set out to do. Furthermore, you're basically stuck with the group/prof for the entire commitment, and can't quit halfway. There's this famously large group that gets some 15+ MDP students each year, and it's *so horribly* mismanaged it's a complete wonder to me how they manage to stay in the program each and every year.. . In my view the program is inherently flawed. . . If you want to gain research experience, just talk to some faculty who are often more than willing to have some undergrads help out in their research. There's absolutely no need to do the MDP's faculty research projects as if you don't like the group for whatever reason, well, good luck, as you can't quit halfway. . If you want some industry experience, honestly go do an internship, but if you can't get an internship yourself then this program might have some use for you to put on your resume, though honestly I haven't seen any Michigan students have too much trouble on getting internships.. . And, the MDP program is structured so that as students you can't *really* complain about the program itself to *anyone in the program*. There's a bunch of these bullshit peer review forms and whatnot, which you can't *really* use to complain because while they're seen by the people running the program and your advisors, *your grade is based off of these forms*. Which, to I and to many who were students in this situation, were **afraid of retaliation** if we said *anything* negative about the program, because as you can see, once you're in you can't get out for the year. It's no wonder the program keeps running each year as they probably think they're doing *great* because all their review forms probably say that.. . This is not to say no one enjoyed their program. It's honestly a great way to gain *some* experience, *if you like the group*. But the way MDP is structured is that you need to commit *before* you get to even know the group a bit more (which you honestly can't get without working with them for a bit), and you're stuck once you commit. If you find out you don't like the work done / group style for whatever reason, like OP has found out 2 weeks in, you're shit out of luck, for you're stuck for the entire *year*.. . Personally, with all the bullshit we had to go through, my teammates then have become some of my best friends today. However, the *commit-before-you-try-out* (or quit and tank your GPA for 8/4/2 credits) and all the bullshit presentations/design reviews/*WHATEVER* detract from the goal most students joining the program come with, misguided or not - either to gain research experience or industry experience. There's much easier ways to gain those than having to go through this program. Remember, if you're paying any kind of tuition, you're *basically* **paying** to go through this bullshit for 8/4/2 credits. For that amount of money, I'd honestly think twice.. .

Being a senior at Umich now, I can't fathom how much unnecessary stress, confusion, and learning troubles I would have dealt with if I hadn't ever received the professional guidance on how to study effectively, how to maintain a healthy medication regimen, and how to curb the stressors and confusions of everyday life with ADD/ADHD.. .

Basically, the total number of vaccinations hasn't been reduced, but previously UM medicine was the primary source of distribution, meaning that everyone who wanted to get the vaccine had to come to UM medicine. . . . With this new allocation method, the vaccine is being decentralized to more local areas. Instead of the people coming for the vaccine, the vaccine is coming to them, which is much better from a health perspective and an accessibility standpoint. Many people can't take the time to drive to Ann arbor to get a vaccine, or they may not have access to a car. . . . On top of that, it's restructuring the vaccine schedule somewhat. While covid is disproportionately affecting elderly people, it's also disproportionally affecting poorer people. The more vulnerable populations should get the vaccine sooner, as they are at higher risk of infection and morbidity. . . . From a student perspective, this has very little impact on us because we were last in line anyway. . . .

In wasthenaw county the worst was in October and November presumably due to frat parties, but holistically in the state of michgan, California, texas, florida and new york (where many of the out of staters are from) rates are worse now. Also keep in mind while covid is still a developing situation, it was a larger one in fall 2020 and from an ignorance standpoint the regents argued it wasn't so bad. And that bit them in the butt hard. They can't play that card again.. . True if vaccine rollout does work but there are more strains of the virus now and depending on homology they aren't as effective than on the base strain. That is something to wary of.. . Finally, yes if the vaccine is all good there is no need to be remote however that's a big if. 50% of michgan students are oos and each state and county has their own distribution schedules.

A lot of us go through life without getting close enough to an endowment to have to know the ins and outs of how they work. . . An endowment is a great resource, but it's not a checking account. People react to these numbers as if Stanford has $26.4 billion it COULD be spending (but just refuses to because it sucks, is greedy, etc) just like UM has $11.9B it could spend if it were just less sucky and greedy. That belief is great for ginning up anger but that's not quite right. . . Endowments are legally structured so that they cannot be spent. They're like a permanent investment account. That's what donors stipulate when they give an endowment gift. Institutions aren't supposed to spend that money.. . What they can spend is some of the income that this money generates.

But just remember that the resources do not equal the value of the endowment. They provide more like 4.5% or 5% of the endowment, depending on how the institution chooses to manage spending.. . Here's the other limit: usually the donors specify what an endowed gift's income is for. As a result, the institution isn't 100% free to spend the income on any problem, issue, need, or great idea it runs across. In other words, it may get hundreds of millions of interest income to spend, but those dollars have to be allocated with so much towards kidney research, library collections, sustainability, financial aid, and so on.",43.0,negative,0.4689960479736328

It's impossible for any of us to know how well you would do as an individual, as some thrive and excel, while others will find it extremely challenging. In my opinion, I was pretty satisfied with my education at UMich and I feel like it has prepared me well for medical school. I've had some mediocre professors here but I've also had some really incredible lecturers that I can attribute my success to. . . >Are there sufficient volunteering/research/internship opportunities in the campus or in the nearby Ann Arbor area? . . More than enough. One of the huge advantages of Michigan is the fact that the medical school/hospital is right next door, so there are plenty of volunteering/research opportunities for you to pursue. I can say that at the medical school I go to right now, the undergrad is a 40-minute train ride away, whereas at Michigan it's literally a 10 minute walk. Especially with research, UMich's med school/hospital is really highly regarded. Also just FYI most premeds don't do internships, but a lot of people do summer programs/research/study abroad. Another huge advantage is that it's a huge student population, including graduate programs, so there are more than enough research opportunities for everybody, you just have to put in the work to find it. . . The only thing I remember that was difficult to obtain was shadowing (but this may be a universal thing, not a Michigan thing), but it is still possible. . . >Do the classes prepare you well for the MCAT? . . In my opinion, most do yes. I felt especially prepared for Chemistry, given how rigorous the classes here were. All other subjects too except for E&M Physics. But regardless of how well prepared you are from the classes you do have to put in a good amount of self-study work to do well on the MCAT. . . > Are there any other activities in U of M that might enhance my medical school application? . . I mean what looks good on a med school application are you exceling in things you are passionate about. It's not like college application where you can say that you were in NHS or Key Club or w/e and that ""checks"" a box for them. Unless you're doing some prestigious fellowship or are a D1 athlete or something along those lines, what's gonna get you in are 1) good GPA/MCAT, 2) good Personal Statement (your ""Why Medicine"" essay) and Letters of Recommendations, and 3) ECs that show your passions. You do have to do some check boxing for medical school (clinical volunteering, non-clinical volunteering, shadowing, research, etc.), but you can take those in a variety of ways that show your interest in what you are doing. Being a cookie-cutter applicant makes it very difficult (not impossible) to get into medical school. . . This is all just my opinion FYI so do take with a grain of salt.. .

I am so sorry this has happened to you. . . **As for continuing as a researcher, here are some things you can do**. . 1. F-1 Visa students are ***entitled*** to 1 year of OPT, optional practical training. Use that to apply to work under your professor as a researcher, full time if you can. When I was getting rejected left right and center from PhD programs, this is what I had as a backup plan. My friend did it too, as did another friend. It worked out for my friends who weren't able to get PhD positions at first.. 2. Your additional year of research time (especially full time, with papers published) will strengthen your application a lot. Even if you cannot continue at UofM other schools will very likely consider you. Even if you don't have papers published, having successfully participated in research full time will give you many advantages over other applicants. (It is one thing to be a good student, it is another to be a proven researcher.). 3. Even if the above is no longer tangible, there are other post bach programs that can allow you to extend your time in the US, although it will be expensive. While you are in those programs, try point 2.. . This should serve as a ""warning"" to other international students, as unhealthy as it sounds: when talking about your feelings, NEVER talk about wanting to hurt yourself. It has gotten students (in other school) visa canceled. (Yeah I know this is not healthy, but this is our reality as international students.) The mental health system, should look into this though.. . Lastly, (this part is a rant) our position as international students mean we simply do not enjoy as many privilege as our American peers. I am afraid to tell my advisors I have encountered mental health problems and my productivity has dropped. American students can probably arrange something with the school and advisors because they are under no threat of getting kicked out of the country. Also when we encounter unfair practices (like you on the ward), our only choice is to endure. Sometimes life here feels like this quote:. .

Should we stop providing all emergency medical care to patients who lack legal capacity (MI, stroke, suicidality, acute trauma etc.)? . . Being in the hospital is tyrannical to many people - even for non-psychiatric medical issues. I've met patients who were angry as shit that we treated them, even though we saved their lives and there were no indications they would have wanted otherwise. Society has to operate based on a set of common principles - one of these principles is that we assume people want to be kept alive in most situations. . . In an ideal world, everyone would be asked to fill out a living will and medical proxies as soon as they legally are allowed to. It would certainly make my life a hell of a lot easier. But 90% of patients I treat haven't even been to a lawyer to draw up their medical wishes. And of the remaining 10%, 90% of them simply say ""I'll make the decision at time of situation."" Except that logic fails everyone when they aren't conscious, etc. . . I guess my point is that acute, new onset suicidality is a medical emergency no different to acute ischemic stroke, massive myocardial infarction, or traumatic accident. It really frustrates me to find people who treat suicidality as some esoteric event that doesn't warrant medical treatment like any other life-threatening event.

They are **not** mental health advice, they are self preservation advice. . . 1. before devulging any mental health struggles, please find out what the person could and would do with this information. Some professors/advisors are obligated to report you, some are not. Most therapists/psych professionals will only involve the police/psych ward if they believe you're a danger to yourself or others. In this case, you are allowed to be passively suicidal, as long as you have no access to weapons and do not have a plan and do not intend to make a plan.. 2. If you are NOT ACTIVELY SUICIDAL and decide to call the CAPS number on the back of the M Card because you're really going through something and would like to call someone, please be careful. They will ask you for your address. **You are allowed to not give it.** If they think that you're in danger, they **will** call DPSS on you, and they **will** charge into your room and forcefully drag you to the psych ward. This process is honestly more like an arrest minus the handcuffs than trying to help you. Obviously they can't do this if you 1. don't give them an address or a full name and 2. make it clear that you have no intent to complete suicide. (Honestly I recommend a non-UM helpline). . 3. If unfortunately you do end up in the UM psych ward, here are some things you should know. if you are an international student, your insurance covers all costs. **However**, if your parents are not tolerant of mental health issues, **check your billing address**. The psych ward will send an itemized bill and your parents will definitely know if it gets sent to your house. Also **check your emergency contact**, since they will get called. I recommend setting it as your best friend/SO in Michigan. As OP said, you are not allowed your phone most of the time, but you can call your friends with a phone they provide. Your friends are allowed to bring you things that have been deemed to not be a risk. Nicotine gum/patches are available if you need it. They usually only hold you for a week. . 4. If it is any consolation the UM psych ward has unlimited snacks, a lounge area, games and a piano.. . It's really sad and bleak that these tips are important, and honestly UM psych ward is one of the cruelest places I have personally seen. The nurses say horrid, unqualified things (told my best friend they are responsible for my life) and they treat you so dismissively and almost with contempt. . . However, on the bright side:. . - if you're international, therapy is 90% covered and anti-depressants are 99.9% covered.. - a lot of professors are very compassionate.

Find your own therapist through googling or asking your CAPS therapist for a list of recommendations. I did the latter and she found some really good ones for me. Include your insurance info and they'll keep it in mind. 2-3 months of private therapy did more for me than 8 months of CAPS. . . You can also ask your CAPS therapist if antidepressants are right for you. They will book you an UHS appointment (usually a 2-4 weeks wait) with a psychiatrist who will grill you on your mental health and prescribe you something that suits your situation. You can also go to your CAPS therapist if you need exam accommodations. . . Side note here: my psychiatrist always asks if I'm suicidal, and I always answer yes, and then she asks if it's passive or active, and it's always passive. Nothing bad has happened to me so far. Imo legit psychiatrists are far, far more compassionate than the nurses in psych ward. . . Professors wise, simply email them! Tell them that you're struggling and ask for help. However, don't mention self-harm/suicide until you are 100% clear on if the professor will report you. . .

However, like the person talking about people with a MSW said, some professions still won't make enough to pay back those loans, even though social workers are very necessary in our society. Perhaps the government or employers or universities could incentivize people to enter professions that don't always make a lot of money but are necessary and important by canceling some or all of their student debt. People who are going into professions that typically pay more like doctors or lawyers (myself included) shouldn't have cancelled debt. I'm definitely for lowering tuition, but it won't happen.

Tonsillitis is a symptom of another issue and they probably deemed your cases too mild and tested for strep and/or mono just to rule them out.

Personally I would hold off on applying until you get most of the way through your internship because you will then have some actual experience to talk about and more of an idea about what you're looking for.. . My experience is the best way to find a job is to focus on building connections, not applying to job posts. The naive way to apply for jobs is to write a resume and generic cover letter (""the job posting requires a cover letter so I guess I'll write one""), sweat every grammatical issue, apply to a hundred job postings, and never even hear back from most of them. A better way is to go to tech talks, career fair, workshops, etc and actually talk to recruiters and industry professionals to understand their business challenges and what they are looking for. Not in a superficial ""here's my 60 second elevator pitch"" or ""I'll ask a technical question so you'll think I'm smart"" way but a genuine conversation to figure out how you can bring value to their business and what skills they are looking for.. . Also, right now we're in a massive recession and most companies have cut back on hiring. That means you may have to work harder to get an actual offer and it may not be your dream job.

It was basically asynchronous except you would meet with a small lab group for 1 hour each week (so you really aren't in lab for 4 hours twice a week). We used a virtual lab thingy called BeyondLabz where you would do the experiments and then there were two worksheets that you had to complete for each lab. There was one lab to complete each week (so 7 labs in total) and you would basically have the entire week to work on it. As well, we had two lecture quizzes that I thought weren't all too bad and there were 3 NMR little quizzes where if you at least attempted to get the correct structure from the NMR, you got 100%. I would say I spent about 2-3 hours each week on this class. I also took this CHEM 216 with CHEM 215 in the summer and, while I still had to spend a good chunk of time on those two classes, I never felt like I was drowning in work and I definitely had lots of free time.

As a result, it is perfectly possible for two people to get very different experiences out of a given program or lab. . . Also imo programs like the one in your example or like UROP are kinda overrated- if you just email professors you can often get paid roles where you can do basically the same work- and get the same credit without having to deal with any commitments or requirements. . . . . In conclusion- just make sure you know what you want to get out of a role before you start, and make sure to communicate that with your PI/advisor/program leader.

There is some at the [CoE/Rackham level(note many have pretty specific criteria)](https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/), and some departments also award fellowship funding in small amounts to Master's students.

Not sure how ECE does it but many of those decisions tend to be centralized at the department level, taking faculty preference into account when possible. When I've seen Master's students from outside UM get GSI positions it is always in their second year. . . The same goes for research positions. If a faculty member can have you work for free and just earn research credit, they will do that first before committing research dollars. The exception to this is usually if you are intending to do a PhD with them beyond your MSE, or if they have grant money that needs to be spent and no PhD student to put on the project. . .

I've heard of plenty of Master's students getting these positions, but you just have to know where to look. . . Usually positions with the department itself are filled by current PhD students who need funding. For you, these would be for sophomore junior or senior level ECE courses. If you haven't heard anything about one of these positions being available to you, then you might want to reach out to some professors within the department to see if they are looking for teachers for next fall. It is likely though that they have their own PhD students who they prefer to take the role over a master's student. However, it is definitely not unheard of for a master's student to hold one.. . The next and best stop for master students would be teaching classes under the general ENGIN banner. This includes ENGIN 101 (beginners coding in Matlab and C) and ENGIN 100 (intro to engineering, with different sections housed in different departments). Both of these courses are ALWAYS looking for GSIs, and their staffs are usually predominantly Master's students! If you have any experience in teaching, or a background in code, then you would probably do very well in the interview process. Primarily these staffs are made up exclusively of UM grad students who also did their undergrad there and learned of the opportunity from a teacher or friend. Students coming from other schools usually don't get the positions just because they don't know about them. If you are interested in teaching 101, you should definitely email Dr. Laura Alford (Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering) or James Juett (Computer Science Engineering) and just explain your situation and mention that you'd really like to be looped in on the initial email blast when interview sign ups get sent out. Interviews usually happen around April. For 100, there is a section usually housed in each department. If you see any that you think you'd be qualified for, you can always reach out to the professor that runs that class and see if they will be looking for hires in the future. Keep in mind though that 100 sections only run one semester per year, while 101 sections run both, so you might have more job security in 101.. . Beyond that, I've heard of quite a few biomedical engineering students going to teach labs as GSIs in the Biology department with great success. Similarly, I hear the Math department is always looking for GSIs for Calc I and II, as those classes are taught in smaller sections to help freshmen adjust to college. I'm not sure where to go for these though.. . I will say from personal experience that quite a few of my friends went on to do a masters in engineering and I only know one person who is paying for that out of pocket. The opportunities are most definitely there, and they don't discriminate by residency status! . . Also at Michigan, you're definitely going to want to be looking for a GSI position.

I suggest applying to scholarships thru the university like the LSA renewable scholarship because scholarships thru the university are usually need-based so you'll most likely receive it if you need it. Apply ASAP to get the full award. LSA also has returning student scholarships so you can apply for those when you become a student. LSA scholarships are usually very generous like up to $10,000. COE also has scholarships and CEW+ too. PLEASE DON'T BE AFRAID TO APPLY TO SCHOLARSHIPS THRU THE UNIVERSITY. They are usually not competitive at all because they are need-based and very few students at umich are low-income (meaning very few students are pell grant eligible.) You basically just need to fill out the application and they'll throw money at you.. . Also, I think it's worth pointing out that if you're looking at your financial aid award on Wolverine Access, make sure you are looking at your OFFICIAL award letter bc sometimes you will be able to see some awards on Wolverine Access even if the office of financial aid has not completed your financial aid package.",2.0,neutral,0.8385972380638123

It just means you'll be expected to pay around $4,000 for expenses like housing, food, book, misc.,etc. . . So, your unmet need is the cost of attendance minus your EFC. The current cost of attendance for a first year for 2020-21 is about $31,500 (this number will be adjusted next year to account for any raises in tuition or other variables). and I'm going to assume your EFC is around $4,000. . . Cost of Attendance: $31,500. . EFC: $4,000. . Cost of Attendance - EFC = Unmet Need. . $31,500 - $4,000 = $27,500. . So, your unmet need is $27,500 and this is the MAXIMUM amount of aid you can receive before the University tries to reduce some of your grants/scholarships.. .

Yeah, cooking is an effort, but it's easy, cheap, and healthy once you get used to it. . . 4) Cost: A 2 bedroom apartment (where I had my own room) costs 50% of what I'd pay to SHARE a room the size of my bedroom with someone else, and I'd need to share a bathroom with an entire hall and a kitchen with an entire building.

I think software engineering principles apply to everything you do, and was the most valuable course I had when working on medium to large scale development projects. It deals with meta issues of projects, and how to apply formal engineering principles to systems, rather than just knowing how to code. That knowledge can make you stand out from colleagues who haven't studied those principles.. . Something like 483 compiler design is an interesting, fun topic, and doesn't hurt to know, but it's a bit esoteric, and I think for most people it's knowledge they won't directly use. Just for comparison, I think with 482, even if you never go on to design operating systems, it still teaches issues about operating systems that are broadly applicable and good to know about. I don't have the same sense with 483.. . 367 autonomous robotics sounds fun, and useful for *certain* projects and industries, but might be non-useful if you happen to work in areas that don't involve hardware or robotics.. . 484 database management systems sounds boring, but databases are such a common element in many projects that I'd think it would be quite generally useful. SQL may be completely omitted from the rest of a CS/CE curriculum, and it's good to have a working understanding of it.. . Somewhat similar with 489 networking...that's an element of so many types of systems, although your exposure to socket programming from 482 is probably enough to get you started on whatever you'd need to learn for a project in practice. The projects sound like applying different protocols to the same basic ideas. Useful but maybe not so critical.. . 493 UI development, while it's a broadly useful topic, I feel like that's an area where you can do just fine without a course on it. Like a person with good common sense and visual design skills would probably still be better at UI design than somebody lacking those attributes who did take a course in it.",7.0,positive,0.7494112849235535

Of course it depends on the company, and the type of internship. Some internships are more varied and instructive than others. And some companies offer several types of software-related internships, including program management that may deal with project specifications spanning different development phases. I think at more elite tech companies like Google or Microsoft, interns get a broader experience than at companies where internal software systems are developed but are not their primary focus, like Meijer or Ford.. . Edit: also ""software engineering internship"", if it really focuses on issues of software engineering, may be different.

Finding ways to create routine and scheduled breaks in the day has been really helpful to me. And it's not routine like, ""at nine thirty on the dot, I make breakfast and coffee"". It's routine in the sense of physically moving out of my home space to go do things not related to my home activities. So four days a week, I go to the gym, and once a week, usually on the day I don't work out, I go to a bookstore and wander about aimlessly for an hour or so. The breaks give me time and space to separate myself from the daily grind and keep me physically active--which like ""exercising is good for your mental health!"" is such a cliche, but it's honestly key to my continued function. But gyms are related to your personal covid situation and risk tolerance, so YMMV. . . Moving outside my home environment also allows and encourages the maintenance of weak ties, so people you see in your daily routine but wouldn't consider friends--your favorite barista, your class friend you never speak to again once the semester ends. In my case, my favorite B&N cashier and the women who also attend my gym. People put a lot of emphasis on close friendships, but there's some research suggesting weak ties are just as helpful, both for mental health and for the things you need networks for, like jobs when you graduate. . . [Zoom fatigue is real](https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/nonverbal-overload/release/1), so turn off the camera and minimize the screen whenever possible. Another thing that helps me deal with this is playing games with low cognitive loads in the background, stuff like minecraft and valheim. I can listen (not quite as well, but well enough) and my hands are occupied, which allows me to move past my natural urge to fidget and scroll while also bypassing zoom fatigue.. . Also, some days it just isn't gonna happen, and that's okay. Let it not happen. Forcing it is only gonna frustrate you, and then you'll be less productive and have more days where it isn't gonna happen. Be kind to yourself and take time where you need it. Find little ways to trigger resets if you really need to get shit done. Your brain can be a bit like a computer, and sometimes that means you need to turn it off and back on again. The gym is one of mine. So is Attack on Titan, and reading, and driving. . . What you're feeling is normal now.

But yeh, lots of code looks similar, especially in 183, 280, and 281, a lot of projects will end up looking similar because there's really only a couple of efficient ways to do them (especially if the project has a very detailed spec that literally tells you what to do). However, moss will split your code into unique hashes and compare it with a database of stored hashes from previous semester's code and online databases (i.e code you can copy from google). Every time you submit to autograder it will be run with MOSS. . . Splitting code into hashes essentially negates a lot of low level cheating obfuscation like variable renaming, structure reordering, spaghetti-fing and ect. If enough similarity is detected, your code gets flagged for a grader to check over and compare. I'm guessing that for super simple functions that only have 1 way to code (i.e a majority of 183), MOSS won't even look at similar function hashes and instead take your overall program style and compare it with others. An actual human being will look over your code if you get flagged.

Like look at tips from articles googling [https://www.google.com/search?q=**how+to+combat+zoom+fatigue**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+combat+zoom+fatigue), and just try to get through one lecture at a time.. . I remember an after-lunch physics course in which I couldn't focus was when I first learned to use caffeine therapeutically, but if you aren't a freshman, you're probably already doing that. . . I've also experienced driving fatigue, and while sometimes that just requires pulling over and resting, I do a few things for a temporary concentration boost:. . * playing music with a good beat. * dancing (even while seated), tapping feet and hands, etc. to increase your heart and respiration rates - even minor continual movement helps. * opening a window for a somewhat uncomfortably cold breeze. . I don't know if those would help you get through a lecture, but it might be worth exploring. Of course you'd want to adjust your audio mixer so you can still hear the class, and might want to Stop Video while you rock out on air guitar.. . As much as I hated walking to classes in the winter, I wonder if the aerobic and chilling effects of those walks might have provided a natural concentration boost that you're now lacking.",5.0,neutral,0.6179893612861633

Then there's ""Ninety-four of the 301 top schools were within Michigan, meaning most, if not all, of those students pay in-state tuition. Despite being only one-third of schools on The Daily's list of 301 schools, these 94 schools contain more than 57% of the admitted students and about 68% of the enrolled students."" . . I don't know why it's surprising that more students from the state of Michigan apply to Michigan, are accepted, and attend. And why does this seem like a problem? It's a public college located in southeast Michigan that gets students primarily from southeast Michigan and the rest of the state; this isn't a feeder-school situation. . . What warrants the remark about most students paying in-state tuition? . . What were they expecting?. . EDIT: It's unclear throughout the article whether they think that. . 1. More out-of-state students should be admitted, and in-state students should pay the same tuition;. . 2. Too many out-of-state students are admitted and create a feeder-school situation that discriminates against Michigan HS graduates from underperforming districts.. . It seems like they try to argue both points somehow. And the article is written like they *are* trying to make a point--not in objective terms.. . EDIT2: Did anyone stop to do the math here? . . > But even within Michigan, there are disparities between feeder vs. non-feeder schools: Of the total enrolled in-state students in the Fall 2019 freshman class, 63% come from one of these 94 schools -- despite these 94 schools making up only 5% of the 1,870 high schools in Michigan.. . Where are those schools clustered in Michigan (hint: out of the top 15 schools on their list, Pioneer, Huron, and Skyline are within 2.5 miles; Saline/Northville/Novi are within 25 miles; and Troy/International/Rochester Adams/Bloomfield Hills/Detroit County Day/Cranbrook Kingswood/Grosse Point South/West Bloomfield are within 50 miles. That's 14/15 schools) and are they possibly... larger, student-body-wise, than the average Michigan high school? The article really ought to consider cross-referencing against student body size--like a per capita approach. . . > White students currently make up approximately 55% of the undergraduate community, whereas just under 68% of the 277 schools are majority white. This does not mean that every student who enrolls from these schools is white, but it does show that many of the schools the University pulls heavily from have more white students filling their classrooms than minority students.. . I... no offence, but this is possibly one of the stupidest things I have ever read. 76% of Americans are white, so yeah, they make up a majority in most schools?

Trust me, I have been all over Ann Arbor looking for housing and I toured countless shitty apartments that go for ridiculous prices. The apartments or houses that do have newer appliances or have been renovated are also ridiculously expensive.. . Off campus apartments are a real bargain compared to what you find in Ann Arbor. I highly recommend it. I think it's way better to live off campus but that really depends on the person. I'm currently living about a 50 minute walk from campus, but less than 20 minute bike ride.

There are also real costs building/maintaining university housing and providing amenities and services within them, but I think dorm fees are calibrated to some extent to limit demand.. . Off campus housing faces a similar issue; a continually growing city with little room for expansion (the main part of the city is bounded by expressways and a self-imposed greenway). Most housing growth is through replacing lower density residences with higher density residences, like the high-rises sprouting up on South University Ave. Off campus housing costs are also elevated by relatively high property taxes, which fund programs favored by the city's relatively liberal voters.. . For an incoming freshman, it depends on the individual, but I'd generally recommend on-campus housing if you're able to afford it, as it's a good way to make friends with other people new to campus. It can also be a good bridge between leaving home for the first time and living on your own; Resident Advisors and other dorm staff can help smooth the transition as you adjust to a different environment.",69.0,neutral,0.6875131130218506

Add that fact to the extremely high cost of renovations and permitting and you see very few people other than large developers able to add to the housing supply.. . Ann Arbor property is also seen as a wise investment. During the housing crash, the price of housing returned to the high level within two years. Therefore, there are many investment property rentals that reduce the supply.. . Ann Arbor also votes for almost every tax increase, so taxes are extremely high on already high property values.

This results in the City having to levy much higher property taxes on everyone else to raise similar or higher levels of revenue.. 3.

I've had social anxiety my entire life (I was a mute kindergartner!) and I've only recently started to suspect it might be more a coping mechanism for neurodivergence (trying to get tested rn, but my psychiatrist is almost certain I at least had adhd).. . It's definitely impacted my experience here at UMich. I feel like I wasted my first few years here and now that I actually wanted to do something about that,,, that chance was taken from me by Covid. (also, I definitely feel you when you say quarantine has made your SAD worse--I'm almost entirely defunct if there's just a regular amount of people at the grocery store and god help me if there's someone in my same aisle).. . My freshman year I was fortunate enough to live in a suite on North campus and I made really good friends with my roommates. We still talk regularly today and they've helped me learn and grow a lot. I also studied abroad, which brought me further out of my shell.. . My advice to you is to try CAPS. Though it didn't work for me and my best friend (we come from a poor area and have A LOT of problems including c-ptsd, SAD, depression, GAD, attachment disorders, etc. as well as likely neurodivergence so we need a lot more than CAPS can really offer), it could very well work for you! In my experience CAPS is like, for minor counseling instead of major rework in your life.. . Second piece of advice, don't let the anxiety win. Your worst enemy is also your best friend here--exposure. The more we isolate the worse it gets (not much of a choice rn though) and the more we socialize the easier it gets. I was put on Buspar recently for my own anxiety and it's been helpful for this. Just don't be like me my freshman year and cocoon yourself in comfort. Try new things. Go out from time to time, assuming we'll be able to next year. Have game and movie nights with your cohabitors. But also don't be afraid of taking time to re-energize yourself and your social battery too!. . If you wanna talk more or be friends, etc, feel free to dm me!",4.0,negative,0.7428799271583557

Second: it's not unusual to struggle with 281, but this specific issue (having a harder time with command line based projects vs visual ones) is not one I've heard often. As a second semester freshmen, you're definitely very early on 281, so don't worry about getting behind if you have to drop it. You're definitely not screwed if you can't get through 281 this semester. . . . . I see that you mentioned having trouble focusing. Is this the main reason that you're struggling with the class? You say that you tried to start early but couldn't focus--what happened next? Did you then wait a week and start again, did you try to push through, or did you wait until the last few days, do what you could, and then submit what you had hoping to get some points?. . . . Unfortunately, working with input/output files and text and command line-based programs is just part of the curriculum here (I imagine it's similar elsewhere, but I'm not sure). Even the classes you might think are more visual (i.e. 485 Web Systems) have command line-based portions to them. I think this is a hurdle you are going to have to face at some point if you want to be a CS major.. . . . Are you able to continue studying CS at Michigan? I firmly believe that anyone who has the time can succeed at CS here, so yes. What you have to decide is whether it will be worth it for *you*. It's not an easy decision to make, but I'm not sure there's much anyone can do to help you make it. . . . . I'm sorry if this comment wasn't super encouraging--I'm not very good at that, I'll leave others who are better at that to do that. I do hope you find the answers you're looking for.",30.0,neutral,0.6685765385627747

I struggled enough that I just kinda hopped ships because I was looking around and going ""shit, I still want a coding career but there aren't a ton of non-EECS majors here that are still coding-heavy."" It's super applications-focused, and most people either end up focusing towards user-experience design or data-analytics stuff, with dashes of webdesign thrown in there.. . That option noted, my retrospect is that I wish I did the EECS minor alongside SI, because the theory you learn in EECS is still super useful and you don't really get it much in SI's undergrad program (grad is different story). . . So yeah, that's a non-theory-intensive, non-weeder-policy way to still have a coding-oriented undergrad without EECS.

Many other CS classes will be similar.. . Maybe it will go better next try. In person classes might make a difference. I don't know what your pandemic experience has been, but for me, years ago, making friends in classes was valuable, seeing how different people worked, having casual conversations with classmates in computer labs.

I was stuck between this school and the school that *literally everyone in my family has gone to for multiple generations, and a ton of my childhood friends are there.* (I'll call it School B for convenience) School B has an amazing graphic design program, but the application process is so grueling. I did the math and found that only like 4% get through all the stages? I didn't want to spend years trying to get into the program, then have nothing to show for and then be trapped. With UMich I was accepted into their BFA program right off the bat, but I worried that the broad curriculum would not prepare me for a specific graphic design career. I also feared about the workaholic culture and the objectively worse socializing I knew I was going to have. I cannot overstate this, I was so worried about this decision that, according to my therapist, I had inpatient levels of anxiety over it. Yep, I could've gone to a hospital if I wanted to.. . Eventually I made myself an ultimatum: if I didn't win a certain scholarship from School B that would let me skip some steps in the application process, I'd choose UMich. I didn't win that scholarship, and so I went here.. . And wow, I'm so happy I chose this school. Like the first week upon coming here I knew I made the right decision. Everyone here is really nice, really driven, and I've already experienced so many opportunities I knew I would not have gotten at School B. My views on the graphic design industry have also changed dramatically, so I'm very thankful for the broad cirriculum to let me parse through that.

If you live in IV near the basketball court & fire station, the Northwood Express cuts that down to 10-15 during semesters and in the mornings.. 3. I'm not sure as I'm not an international student, but housing will let you transfer your contract to somebody else. I got my contract from somebody leaving a month before the end of their lease, for example. They've paused this process because pandemic, so what I've heard is as of now they're breaking leases when people want to leave. I'd expect this to change back next summer, but finding people to transfer to should be easy, Northwood is desired.. 4. Yes, that's true. A good portion of students leave for the summer and are stuck in 12-month leases. There's a lot more people leaving town than people moving in during that time, so it gets ""race to the bottom"" competitive for subleases.. 5.

I know this from experience because I joined several clubs like this over the years. It seemed like a lot of the people cared more about becoming club president, than they did making friends or having a fun atmosphere. The clubs that come to mind are business-related clubs, social cause based clubs, etc. . . Then there are the fun clubs (e.g. something like anime club or a fitness/weight lifting club), these are just as important. I highly recommend you seek one of these out! Find a hobby or activity you're interested in and join it. In these types of clubs, it's a lot easier to make friends when people have joined because they're passionate about a particular hobby or sport, not because they want to get a summer internship.

I would strongly recommend majoring in CS through LSA if this is the path you are going down; the major requirements are identical and you don't need to take a myriad of engineering classes (2 semesters of physics, a semester of chem, capstone, engin 100, etc.). Recruiters and graduate schools alike do not differentiate between CS-LSA and CS-CoE, so why would you want to? CS-LSA exists solely for people like you who want to double major in another non-engineering discipline. Plus, the time you save taking 2 sets of pre-reqs can be better spent taking graduate/topics courses in whatever subfield(s) of math and/or CS you find interesting.. . A number of my friends in the math department were CS double majors and found the workload to be doable, though depending on how intense you want your time at Michigan to be, there can be some particularly difficult semesters. I'd recommend meeting with a math advisor and/or a CS advisor to try and plan out your schedule.. . Also, kind of a separate point but I do have some more specific advice; if you already have even a little programming experience, try to test out of EECS 183. It's a fantastic course for introducing programming, but it's painfully slow if you've coded before. Also, I would strongly recommend taking Math 465 over EECS 203. 203 is an awfully run course where you don't learn anything, whereas Math 465 can count towards your math degree, is taught by a real professor in a small class, and is genuinely very interesting. The workload is a bit higher, but given that your option is Math 465 or EECS 203 + another math course at some point, 465 is the clear favorite.",3.0,neutral,0.5996074080467224

So I am assuming very close to the end of March, and there is most likely more than one. Regarding if that sounds good or bad, I really can't tell you exactly but I kinda see it like this: because they have multiple waves I think they are going through the applicants as fast as they can, and through their pile in chronological or region based. So if you have a lot of applicants from your region, your ao is gonna take longer to finish them all, and as a reult ur decision would come out later. That's kinda what I think because they do have waves compared to all at once on a specific date which tells me that they just update your app as they finish it, and then whatever those prespecified dates are, they just release whatever decision the ao had put. idk that's just what I think, i could be wrong, but I seriously don't think date means you have a more positive or negative outcome, so try not to stress good luck queen/king <3",1.0,neutral,0.6548779606819153
