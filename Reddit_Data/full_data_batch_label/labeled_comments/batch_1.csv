But it always ended up being a lot less than I could handle. Depends what your major is but I'm pretty sure all LSA students require 7 NS credits which is going to be two full courses.

But I guess without getting too off topic, I think you'd be able to squeeze in a mini course next semester and probably be fine. I don't think it'd be too much to handle but it also won't do much for you since it's just 1 credit. I know for LSA you only need 1 credit of Race and Ethnicity and there's probably some mini courses on that (or just take anthrcult 101 since that class is a joke). Advisors can be tricky and don't really understand why some of us don't want to be here much longer than 4-5 years, so it's tough to really understand what a good schedule is. But you're only a freshman so if you are going to take semesters like such, now is the time hahahah. . .

I would strongly recommend against solely majoring in economics if you want to do something quantitative. Econ 401 and 402 don't really use any math beyond what's taught in calc 1. If you're so interested, you can bring things like Lagrangians and Taylor Series into some of the things they do, but by no means is anyone actually expected to understand/use them. There are a few quantitative upper-level economics electives that are offered, like game theory, trade, and industrial organization, but none of these classes use any math beyond calc 1 as far as I understand. Outside of that, if Econ 457 is offered with Professor Lutz Kilian, that would be your best bet for a quantitative economics course that actually uses linear algebra, but I believe it's only been taught once in the four years that I've been here. Even the econometrics sequence of Econ 451/452 is supposed to be accessible to people who have only taken calc 2, so it doesn't get into anything beyond that outside of a few simple double integrals, and that's probably the most advanced econometrics sequence they will offer, as I don't think the Econ 453/454 sequence will be taught again in the near future. Your math background could actually be very helpful if you decided to write a thesis in economics, depending on whom your advisor is/what topic you're writing about. But I don't think you need to do a major in economics in order to write a thesis - I think you just have to have Econ 401 (maybe 402) and probably Econ 451 and 452 (or possibly the equivalent in a different department). There are courses in other departments that are somewhat qualitatively similar to what is offered in the Econ department, but do a much better job at incorporating more advanced math than calc 1, like EECS/Stats/IOE/Complex Systems/Math (off the top of my head). . . If you don't hate CS, I would recommend at least sticking around and keeping the minor, if not actually finishing a major in CS/DS. If not, I would probably recommend looking into other quantitative majors that you can pair with economics. Financial math is a good option, since a fair amount of courses can double count for both. Stats is also a nice pairing with Econ as well, but make sure to be careful if you go down that route, since some courses between the departments are substantially similar, and you probably don't want to essentially take the same course twice. If you're in Engineering, IOE might be a good option as well - plus there are pretty good recruiting opportunities out of there as well. . . For me, I think it would have been a lot harder to recruit if I didn't double major in data science to go along with econ, even though now I'm doing something that probably could be done with an econ degree.. .

Intro classes are always 100 levels, and ""2nd"" classes are often 200 level. 500 level courses are often introductory graduate courses, and 600 level courses are often topic courses/reading seminars and the like.. . . . 2) the Y usually stands for a specific subtype of courses. At least in the math department, Y = 9 often symbolizes ""hard"" or ""honors"". The 59X classes in the math department represent the (first year grad student) classes which cover the material necessarily to pass a qualifying exam, for example. The 49X courses are often upper level undergraduate material (abstract algebra, introductory topology) with 498 being a topics course for upperclassmen in the math department. The Y = 6 courses are often combinatorics-ish courses (465, 565, 566, 567), and the Y = 5 courses are ""applied"" courses (550,555,556,557,558) (though again, not always. Math 451/452 are notable examples) . . . 3) the Z stands for nothing in particular, just a distinguisher between courses. Successive courses are often of the form XYZ, XY(Z + 1) but not always. . . . As an example, EECS 281 is a (2)nd year course, and the 8 stands for the introductory C++ sequence (183, 280 both have Y = 8), and the Z = 1 is just siginfying that it is the next course after the Z = 0 course (EECS 280).",2.0,neutral,0.8886305093765259

He had a really tough time opening up to the therapist (partly due to his belief that doing so would not help), but over time he found that the medication he was prescribed improved his mood just enough to give him a small glimmer of hope, which kept him alive long enough to get better.

Yes, there are weekly homework assignments, but they are great practice for the exams. It allows you to see where you have gaps in your knowledge, so you can make sure you understand the material before the exams. You also receive feedback on the homework, so you can make sure you're wording your conclusions correctly. Also, the day before the homework is due, I would recommend going to the office hours to check over the homework with the other students and to ask the GSIs for help on certain questions; by doing this, I ended up getting a 98% average on homework. . . The MWrite assignments aren't even that bad and allows you to apply the statistical concepts in a real-life context. Plus, there are only 2 of them (although I did think the peer reviews were annoying). . . Regarding the interpretations of scenarios, I didn't think they were that critical during grading. They are picky with wording because you really do need to include specific words to make sure the conclusion is accurate. I made sure to follow the exact wording that Gunderson wrote down in lectures in the coursepack, and I never got any points off in my conclusions in my exams. . . . To be honest, I enjoyed this class so much that if I took it my freshman year, I would've probably majored/minored in stats, but it was too late since I took it my last semester.

You want to make sure you have time to do all the debugging and troubleshooting you need to get your code working correctly.. 2. With that said, don't start the projects too early. Usually, the week or so after the project is assigned, the lectures will cover the information you need as background for the projects. Feel free to start as soon as you want, but some of the concepts may not make sense until you attend the lectures.. 3. Write the projects yourself. Especially for the projects on linked lists and binary search trees, the exam material is directly related to your understanding of the project material.. 4. If you're not comfortable writing code on paper, go to labs. They give you some good practice exercises to make sure you get used to writing outside of an IDE. Also, make sure you find an IA that works for you - you're allowed to go to whatever lab you want, so make sure you're getting the most out of your lab sessions.. 5.

First, it's separate from LSA. It's only a two year program so you'll be in LSA for two years before moving to the (SI). This fact isn't a big deal and it won't feel like a significant transition.. . Second, the BSI program has three ""paths"" that you can specialize in. \~45% of people go Information Analysis (IA), \~35% UX/Design, and \~15% Social Media Analysis/Design. Your path really only affects your senior year classes.. . All three paths will learn a lot about coding, case studies, econ, design, real-world writing, networks, and more. The coding isn't too strenuous (almost all python), so if you're really interested in CS I'd suggest minoring in EECS as well. There's a moderate amount of writing, but it's almost all case studies and real world scenarios. Most classes' essays are under one page and you'll learn the importance of writing ""fast and good"" (and you'll learn to love or hate Professor John King, there's no middle ground haha).. . I can tell you a bit about the IA and UX paths. IA is much more data-heavy. Our classes work with databases and dataframes (Pandas usually) to create/manipulate data and find conclusions. UX works more with UX and User Experience. They have classes in web development (including designing the front-end and backend of websites), graphic design, and using web-based templates. There is more to all the paths than what I've listed; people go into a broad array of careers from the BSI so don't worry if those don't interest you.. . The BSI also has a capstone project you'll work on all of Senior year. You'll be put into a small group (1-4) and assigned a company (Ford, UofM, Amazon, Chicago Public Library, etc) whom you'll consult with and work on a project with. I'm obviously only one semester in, but I would say this is the biggest advantage of SI. It's great real-world experience.. . Finally, the BSI has iTrack. It's the SI's career website and it's amazing for finding internships/jobs for BSI students. It's much better than resources available for LSA students :). . . .

There's always someone having a conversation in the halls, playing some music, or heading off to go to a party, but it's honestly really nice! It's never hard to strike up a conversation with a random stranger, and in my experience, has never been distracting when I have to sit down and study. Weeknights are pretty low-key, and if any nights are going to be a bit noisier than usual, it's most likely Friday/Saturday. . . Pros of living here definitely include the social scene. Since (mostly?) everyone here is a freshman, everyone is pretty approachable so it's not very hard to make friends! The study lounges are also pretty nice, as well as having a dining hall that's almost never crowded within the dorm (although I still do prefer Mojo's dining hall, which is less than a three minute walk away). Also, as an engineer, I love having a Commuter North bus stop right by the building!. . In all honesty, the only real con I have is the room size. 11x12 isn't necessarily luxury, especially when larger-sized dorms are right across the street (I'm looking at you, Alice Lloyd). Luckily, you adjust to the room size quite quickly, and if you take the time on move in day to adjust the room right, you'll find that you have more space than you think. Definitely do your research on how you want to set up the room in advance in order to maximize your space. Also: BRING A FAN! BRING TWO FANS!!! BRING SO MANY FANS!

It's a really cool program that really lets you do what you want. The BFA especially lets you sort of study whatever you want. . . As far as course requirements go, I think you'll probably be mostly done with the EECS [requirements for Sound Engineering](https://smtd.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PAT-BS-2017-2018.pdf), which earn you a minor in electrical engineering. What'll take up most of your time now are the PAT and music requirements. All of the PAT requirements will take you a minimum of two years once you get into the program, even if you've gotten a head start and get some of the prereqs waved by the department, and the four semesters of music theory will take you about the same amount of time. I don't really know much about what CE encompasses course wise, but a lot of my friends that transferred into SE from either EE or something else caught up pretty quick.. . As far as courses go, there's some really cool ones you take! Creative Coding, Sound Reinforcement, Studio Production... there's some really cool courses. I will say that academically the courses are no where near as challenging as any EECS course I've taken so far, but the challenge here is more about what you get out of it. If you don't take the time to practicing your mixing chops, you could ace the exams and have mixes that sound like garbage. So some of that artsy fartsy creative stuff really comes to play in the PAT specific courses, which I think is the coolest thing about PAT. Like I said, they really encourage you to use both sides of your brain to do basically whatever you're interested in.. . As far as doing a dual degree, there aren't TOO many people in PAT doing another major in COE but there are a few. We had a career fair last fall and a few alumni came back that had done a dual degree. They said for their career it wasn't super viable, but it helped. I know tons of people at cool jobs that just did the BS. But I'm also very of the mindset of not worrying about jobs as much, but sticking with what you really care about and are interested in and the jobs will follow, especially in a field like sound and all that.. . This was a lot. I hope I helped! If you wanna talk feel free to PM me, love PAT a lot and I think I know a decent amount about the department. Good luck with ya interview!",6.0,error,0.0

For starters, I definitely think a dual degree in 5-6 years is doable - it sounds like you aren't trying to cram everything into too little time, which is good. There's a lot of overlap between CE and SE, if you've already taken the EE and CS requirements then the hard part is out of the way. The main track PAT and music theory reqs will indeed take at least 2-3 years, but few of those classes are anywhere near as hard as most EECS stuff. There are some essays and projects that will creep up on you, but it's not a constant grind. . . I wouldn't say you need a dual major to get a job, and you can also do a minor in CS to supplement the EE minor that comes with. However, I feel like a dual degree pretty much guarantees you some good job prospects so take that as you will. Don't feel obligated to keep it if things get too crazy and stressful. . . I've really enjoyed a lot of my PAT classes here, and I strongly recommend joining! You meet and play music with a lot of cool people, and you'll grow your skills as a musician, producer, and engineer for sure. I think it's a great way to get the most out of what umich has to offer.

I took 17 for a semester and it was awful, idk how people do 18 every semester because you just get burnt out so quickly when you have midterms every week for more than half the semester. If I were you, I'd start out the first year taking classes for both majors and then start thinking about what you really want to do with your career. If you want to do materials or structures work for a marine/naval company, you can likely achieve that with just a matsci degree. If you care more about boats than materials, maybe consider just a NAME degree. The other thing I would suggest is talking to upperclassmen or alumni. Either department could probably point you toward someone doing exactly what youd like to do and you can talk to them and figure out how to follow a similar path. That's how I figured out my major, I was originally going to double in CS and ME because I wanted to do systems design, but I found out that could be accomplished as a ME with extra coursework in controls. And with careers in general it's all about how you sell yourself, like if you decide to just go with matsci you can still approach NAME recruiters at career fair and say ""hi I'm ____ and I wanna work on polymers for boats and I'm on x,y,z boat related team"" and they'd probably be just as interested in taking to you as many traditional NAME majors. And as others have said, there's a matsci minor and a lot of people do grad school in a different major than their undergrad. . .

In the past, the honors program was pretty much elitist where they'd compare their stats to Ivy Leagues on their website and only invite the top 5-10% of applicants by test score to apply. My GSI said that they're trying to change that by removing those pretentious phrases, and randomly extending invites to 50% of accepted students. She said that honors shouldn't be about being smart and having the highest scores (every Michigan student is capable), so they're trying to gear it more towards being hungry to learn and engage with the world.. . Stats don't matter that much per se. The essay in showing intellectual curiosity, personality, self awareness, creativity, and ambition were weighted number one. At my summer 2017 honors orientation, Mika literally said that he read a boring ass cookie cutter essay, said the applicant probably had a perfect standardized test score because it was so lame and predictable, and then rejected it because it didn't fit the vision.. Basically take your essay seriously and it's not hard. Maybe reaching out to admissions if you get deferred can help.. . It's not isolated. Mika mentioned that they could've made an honors college, but made it a program instead because they wanted it to be less isolated. If you're worried about being stuff with the same people on honors classes and housing, all of those are optional anyways. You'd want to avoid some honors versions of classes (namely BIO people complain about), and the advisors in general might nudge you towards honors stuff you don't need lol. The math ones are generally more generous with grading, and I like the core classes and electives to fulfill distribution because they're easier to get an A imo. . . For the third points, I'd say that honors classes also mostly have easier access to faculty and actual professors. If you raise your hand in lecture for answers and talk in discussion it should work in your favor. Honors math also are all taught by actual professors I believe.. There's no real downside IMO, you're not forced to do anything, and have exclusive access to numerous benefits like the housing, classes, advising, fellowship/grad school/scholarship resources, events, etc. Honors curriculum has changed a ton over the past few years, and entering class of 2017 to now is pretty lax with their requirements. I'm sure you can look up and compare past years ""requirements"" too (not really requirements because you only get kicked out sophomore year if you don't meet them LOL). . Something you could do if you wanted access to good rec letters and research, do UROP/MRC! You can do UROP with honors, but not MRC. You're guaranteed a research project with a professor who you can get to know well, so you just have to be sure to pick one aligned with your interests. This will leverage you for both of those things you wanted (possibility of a great relationship with a professor = good rec, research experience = more preference for other research in the future), and there's options beyond UROP, after UROP too. You can probably find more information on their website; UROP itself isn't very competitive but apply early (ESPECIALLY if you're CS, I missed out freshman year because of that).",9.0,error,0.0

Recently, I got into a great grad school, and the school had an older alum contact me who also did his undergrad at UMich and is now an exec at a large financial firm in NY. We chatted for like 5 minutes before he talked about Jim Harbaugh and how he was a student back during his UMich days. Just casual, laid back chat about sports, gameday partying, reputations of different bars, ... that's something you can get at different state schools, but combined with Michigan's academic success, it means that it's a lot easier to relate to folks in high places who may have gone to school at a very different time than you. Even if they can't visit the Arb often anymore, they hear their school in the sports news all the time and can chat about it whenever. . . . Because of sports, alumni have guaranteed informal networking events every Saturday in the fall in major cities worldwide. So what I'm saying is -- even if you're not huge on sports coming in (like me), definitely enjoy the ""cultural experience"", because it keeps the UMich alumni connected globally in a way few others are -- (maybe Duke is the only other one with the combination of successful alumni + always in-the-news sports team)",5.0,neutral,0.5395175218582153

Big school, big football pride, fat and friendly squirrels, dont step on the seal, big clock tower, etc. However, as I've learned now, I would much prefer UofM. The main thing that is so attractive to me is how passionate its alumni base is and how big it is. In my high school marching band of about 60 people, before I graduated, 3 immediate friends of mine, in band, had a parent that went to UofM. That's just in band! Way out in California! And after I chose Michigan, my parents started wearing UMich stuff to work, and found loads of people that went to Michigan. One story my dad likes to tell is that he was on a call with one of the higher ups (who went to Michigan) and my dad right away started talking business, but the higher up went ""Woah woah woah, that can wait, let's talk Michigan football first"".

The clubs are so plentiful, you can always find a group that shares similar interests and you can bond with. Every club, almost without exception, is overjoyed to accept new members.. The city is very active and interesting. Almost every day you can find live music somewhere in the city (like the blind pig which is 18+). Most of these places are 21+ though. There's also classics like Pinball Pete's and Vault of Midnight to go to with friends.. The weather. There's lots of seasons and you never know what next day will bring. I'm dead serious about liking it (though it gets pretty cold and some people really hate the weather).. The gyms are free for all U of M students, and the facilities are very well maintained.. The campus and city are both very beutiful. The buildings are majestic, and there is a huge arboretum with miles of trails that you can walk on. I ran cross country and there are more trails scattered around the city than you'd believe. [Geocaching](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching) is also a thing here.. . A few cons(take these as seriously as you want because this is all personal experience):. Classes that everyone takes like Calculus and Chemistry have been terrible for me. Teachers are mostly incompetent and its luck of the draw to get a good professor. Average class grade for Calc 2 exam 2 was 55% while my section's average was 45%. [Here's a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/9hs7cl/comment/e6fq37c) that gives a pretty good idea what my chemistry teacher was like. I got by fine because I self studied these classes but I feel sorry for the people that relied solely on the teachers for guidance. Its absurd that after paying 30k for a year of schooling I have to take compromises with my education and ""hope"" that my teachers are good. That said, I have friends who had good teachers and excelled because of it.. Keep in mind that this was only my experience for the huge classes that everyone took. Some classes have graduate student instructors (GSIs) that teach lab portions, and they have all been motivated, helpful, and enhanced my learning experience greatly. Classes that are more specialized have a lot better teaching quality and I loved all of them so far. It's also not too big of a deal to teach yourself just one or two classes.. My experience with group projects was fine, but my friend got stuck with an unmotivated group that was fine with putting all the work on him. The honor code forbids you from doing someone else's work and submitting it with their name, so once he mentioned that and demanded equal workload, the situation sorted itself out. I just didn't expect those kinds of people at this school and want to let you know that they still exist.. . Overall, I'd recommend this school but be willing to go the extra mile and self teach if you want a good grade. The community and city are amazing. I love it here and I never think to myself ""I wish I chose a different college"".",2.0,error,0.0

My hot takes:. . * 370 - super interesting content and fantastic projects, but the lectures, homework, and exams are rough. The entire class is framed about a fictional assembly called LC2K. Every project focuses on incrementally implementing different features of low level computer language. Lecture content can be super confusing though, and is only really helpful in retrospect once you've really dug into the related project and are reviewing slides. Homeworks and exams are pretty bullshit though - a lot of bullshit math word problems, and every once and a while they'll write questions about ARM or x86 assembly [depending on the professor/semester] despite the fact that the course content never covers actual assembly languages in any real depth. The projects do a lot to help you understand how compilers and caches and all the other stuff that's generally abstracted away by high-level languages, but everything else is super frustrating.. . * 485 - kinda similar to 370, except lectures are much higher level and do a better job of explaining big concepts, there is no homework outside of projects, and exams are absolutely brutal. Again, the projects are super fun and will do a lot to help you understand the basics of how the internet works as both a platform for hosting, distributing, presenting, storing [etc.] content and as a networking tool for communicating between machines and distributing the workload for massive tasks that require the processing power of all of them at the same time. It will also introduce the idea of asynchronous programming to you, which is a super important concept that I'm surprised isn't covered in a required class.. . I would 10/10 recommend both of these classes. As for 493, I've heard a lot of mixed opinions. Most people I've talked to tend to say the class is a little disorganized, which makes it simultaneously low-effort and difficult to grasp exactly what's expected of you. This is true of a lot of the smaller ULCS I've gathered [side note: DO NOT take 486]. As for calc 3, it's Michigan math. It's the only calc class I didn't take, but from my understanding, it's the second or first most difficult in the calc 1-4 series [toss up between 2 and 3 depending on who you ask].

Sit down with your notes from the lectures/readings/whatever course material that will be on the exam. Then, type out anything you think could possibly be on the exam all out into a Word/Google Doc. For me, that means things like lists (three reasons, three explanations for, you get the gist), things emphasized by the professor, vocabulary words related to the course and examples of usage if applicable.. . Once you've got everything, print that out and just carry it around with you. It's easier than studying a bunch of notes because you don't know what of those notes is filler that you've written down or important concepts. It's also more convenient because I, for one, am more likely to keep a four or five page study guide in my backpack at all times than a course notebook. Obviously this doesn't work for everyone, but for my classes that are lecture heavy these study guides I make myself are godsends. . . EDIT: I should add that I like to start this about two weeks ahead of an exam. I'll try and finish it to give me at least ten days with the printed out guide to study and write on the guide anything from the subsequent classes to add-on.. . Other stuff (dunno what you're studying so I'll keep it broad and narrow in on other things): . . - Quizlet is your best friend. ESPECIALLY for foreign language vocab. . . - Find a designated study spot. I love the ref room in Hatcher and get tons of stuff done there. Some people I know adore the third floor of the Ugli. It's all about finding your space.. . - Decide what type of study person you are. Do you like working with people, or by yourself? That can be an important distinction.. . - Take notes in class by hand. This is something I SWEAR by. I retain information way better when hand-writing notes. Then I copy things into my laptop by way of my study guide method, but if you don't do notes by hand, give it a go.. . - Definitely plan things out. I'm not talking like even the semester in advance (although I did that last year and that was very helpful) but if there's like a paper due in a month, start thinking about the prompt. One of my friends once joked that I'm obscenely on top of the ball with papers because I finish a week-and-a-half ahead of the due date, but giving yourself ample time really leads to good work. . . - Finally, designate study *times* too. I can't study in-between classes with just an hour or two between them. Likewise, if I don't have class till the afternoon, I cannot study in the morning before hand. To compensate, I will go to a study spot after class or after dinner and grind out work. In turn, I allow myself a weekend day and those times that I cannot get myself focused ""off"". . .

I'm not even sure graders actually run the scripts you write. And the standards for what receives full credit are never entirely clear. Often times you'll find yourself wondering whether you implemented something wrong or if it's expected that the algorithm will only be 50% accurate. Graders will never give you a straight answer as to what the threshold is for a good implementation until you bully it out of them. The class is designed to be open-ended in an attempt to encourage students to set their own goals for coding assignments, which sounds great until you remember that this is the reason you went into EECS instead of liberal arts.. . There was an assignment to implement a webcrawler for the eecs.umich.edu domain. The assignment only said that the webcrawler had to filter out non-html and non-eecs sites. I was docked points because my crawler included a link to an .ico file that 404'd. I argued that since the link returns a page containing html [the 404 message] it should have counted, but they said that ""a good webcrawler should filter out error pages."" I pointed out that nowhere in the assignment did they tell us we needed to handle for response codes, but they refused to change my grade. . . The entire second half of the class is entirely open-ended. You form a group and pick your own project designed around some sort of algorithm or concept you learned in lecture, subject to the approval of the professor. This actually isn't quite as bad as the coding assignments because graders won't be as familiar with what you did, which means they won't have the same context to know if your project is half-assed, so it's much easier to get a good grade.. . Lectures are all over the place. You'll learn five different algorithms every lecture and it'll be impossible to tell what you actually need to remember for the exams. There is no sense of real focus because there are only three assignments before the final project, and there's easily fifteen major topics for every assignment that just don't appear in the assingments themselves.

Start outlining your argument and evidence at least a week before you need to turn in your paper. Then go talk to your GSI, walk through your argument, and let them push back on it to strengthen it. They will try to help you tease out your argument and help show you where there are holes. Literally this is main thing we learn in grad school: find holes in arguments. And you can probably get more engagement if you aren't there the day before when half the class finally realizes there are office hours. You can then write the paper and potentially bring it back for more feedback if you so desire. . . 2) Proofread! Read it multiple times. Read it back to front (really). Read it aloud. And get other people to read it and tell you anything that's confusing. A reason things like grammar, clarity, and spelling are often weighted pretty heavily in rubrics is because the GSIs are reading 50+ papers at once. If it's not clear we don't have the time to try to figure out what you meant because we are trying to return these to you guys in a week. And I can tell you that after 3 or 4 poorly written essays I was SO grateful to one that was just readable it probably made me a nicer grader (no matter how fair I tried to be). . . 3) Try to make some time on a weekly basis to take a step back and think about what you've been learning. How do the various readings and lecture topics fit together? How do the different readings reinforce or contradict each other? What are some of the themes of the class?

t1_ecluv1d,2018-12-26 20:06:07,t3_a9jt1g,t3_a9jt1g,"It's pretty simple really.. . * **Start your assignments as soon as you can.** Obviously you won't always be finished with your last assignment before you get a new one from another class, but getting ahead of your work is important.. . * **Do the practice exams.** Studying with your own notes and material is alright, but nine times out of ten, practice exams will be a much better representation of the things your professor actually wanted you to get out of the class than what you assume is the important information you need to know. Don't even worry too much about taking super thorough notes in lecture - it's much more important to stay engaged with the lecture itself and ask questions, and most professors will upload the slides anyway, so notes are only really important in the ""writing things down helps commit them to memory"" kind of way. At least for me.. . * **Meet people in your major who have the same study habits** as you so you can motivate and work with each other. I always found that it's much more productive to study for a practice exam like so:. . 1. Everyone sits down and does the practice exam [either the entire thing, or you can do this one page at a time]. . 2. Compare answers, explain your reasoning, and try to make a case for yourself whenever you disagree with someone. This step is super important, because it really gets you to think about the material in a deeper way and consider it from someone else's point of view. Try to come to a consensus.. . 3. Check the answer key. If everyone was eventually convinced of the correct solution before checking the answer key, then you're golden. Now everyone has heard the reasoning behind the correct solution. If the consensus is wrong, have whoever had the right answer initially explain it to everyone again, or if nobody was right, go back to the slides to figure out where you went wrong or go to office hours to figure it out.. . This is really all I ever did to graduate with something between a 3.6 and a 3.8. I've always felt like it's also helpful to list thinks you *shouldn't* do:. . * **Don't sweat exams too much** - the real content of the course is the projects and assignments. Don't ever pull all-nighters studying, because it just builds stress and kills your energy. Going over practice exams as I described should always be sufficient studying, and this should really only take one or two of your evenings leading up to exam day. If practice exams are insufficient, either you've got a shitty professor or it's way too late for you to start getting your shit together.. . * **Don't put off or skip out on assignments**. Avoid pulling all-nighters in order to finish assignments at all costs, but do it if necessary, because the easiest way to lose out on understanding key material is by missing assignments. Even if they drop your lowest n homework grades or something like that, do it anyway because (a) it's important material that you're gonna need to understand eventually, (b) this is probably the lowest-stakes, most hand-holding version of that material you're gonna get in the class, and (c) it's better to drop the assignment you did do and got a 60% on that it is to drop the assignment you didn't do and keep the D.. . * **Don't isolate yourself, but don't also rely too much on others.** Having like-minded classmates to do assignments and practice exams with is the best way to avoid getting stuck, getting frustrated, procrastinating, and maybe even eventually giving up. But also don't entirely rely on their work and answers in order to stay afloat. If someone else gives you an answer, make sure you also ask them to explain how they got it and that you can replicate their results from scratch. Lift each other up by means of sharing understanding, not just answers and grades. Make sure you try everything independently first so that you can figure things out for yourself and maybe even help someone else understand something.. . And lastly, don't forget to have a life outside of class. Join a club, pick up a video game, get a job, etc. Having some sort of commitment or procrastination tool that helps pull you away from schoolwork for a while is both important for your mental health and can help you get away from things for a while so that you can refresh the cache and look at things somewhat fresh again.",2.0,error,0.0

With two factor, even if your password gets compromised, an attacker would still *also* need to compromise your second factor, and since it's not the same type of factor (i.e. not just another password), it's much more difficult (though certainly not impossible) to compromise. . . Factors are typically divided into categories. Common ones are: something you know (a password), something you have (your phone, a security token, a u2f key, etc.) and something you are (biometrics, like fingerprint, face id, and retinal scans). typically, gaining access to two factors would require physical access to you (barring phishing), so having two factors greatly increases your security.. . that said, if your password ever gets compromised, you still need to change it (otherwise, one of your factors is not really valid, and you're back to single factor).. . if you're using the same password on multiple sites, you should break this habit. It's not possible to memorize different passwords on hundreds of different sites, so don't. get a password manager. Dashlane, Lastpass, Keepass, and many others are all decent solutions. use randomly generated passwords on every site, then if one gets compromised, you sigh, and change it, and move on, with not much inconvenience. Some of these password managers can even change your password for you automatically!. . Now to drive this point home, I'd like to share a website with you: https://haveibeenpwned.com/. . enter your email there, and it will search through a ton of known leaks, and see if your password has ever been compromised.

You spend so much time effort and energy interacting with members to risk being turned away after hours and hours of interaction. It can be super draining and disappointing. . . But I think something else to keep in mind is that with professional frats, there's more to lose but also more to gain. If you get into one you have an amazing amount of resources and a unique community all at your fingertips, and often BECAUSE rush is so time consuming people are more involved as a whole after becoming a part of the frat (and in my experience there are much lower dropout rates in comparison to groups that require less ""investment""). . . Another reason for the smaller format is logistical -- I think many of them require you to individually meet with each member during your pledging semester just to be assimilated into the community. If professional frats accepted hundreds of people each semester, it would not only be really difficult to keep the whole tightly knit community aspect but also even MORE time consuming to pledge. . . In the end it's really up to you whether or not you think it's worth spending all of the time to rush a prof frat, because again it's super intensive and I hear that rushing a business frat is even more so because of the popularity. But they are unique organizations in the sense that people who take the effort to rush are likely to be more passionate about their frat purpose, and in my opinion that really distinguishes them from other organizations. . . Professional fraternities are DEFINITELY NOT the end all be all of campus orgs. Barriers to entry aside they have much in common with pretty much any other group. Doing research with a professor or becoming an IA are also unique (usually paid!) growing experiences that can help you build your resume if that's what you're interested in.

Make sure to practice drawing the graphs and do your best to understand them. I found it far easier to do well when I understood the material and could build a graph from there. Also, show up to both the lectures and discussion. The lectures are really just a review of the book, but oftentimes the professor will introduce another way of looking at something and it can help. The discussions are used to apply the material and will help you prepare for the tests by using similar questions. Going to discussions really helped me, no matter how boring they could be. Granted, I had Wolfers for lecture so my overall experience will be somewhat different from yours, but I think it generally applies to all ECON 101 classes. . . . . When you're studying for midterms and the final, definitely do the previous tests. They have very similar questions to the kinds you'll have on your tests, so it is very important that practice what you're given. Further, some of those questions will play around with the definition of words, so I'd suggest you'd make a Quizlet with all the terms you learn and practice them relatively often.

If you want to party, choose Mich/Minnie's or Luther. If you are looking for a small community, then one of the smaller houses will be a better fit.

If you want to go to an event at 7pm just stay at school: study at Starbucks or the library, go out with some friends, go to office hours, etc. It wasn't that difficult for me!. . The issue for you will be parking. I was fortunate enough to have a friend with an apartment on campus who gave me his parking spot for very very cheap. See if you can find anyone in an apartment/house selling a parking spot. There are also some rental property companies that sell parking spots alone if you don't want to park and ride. I also have friends that use Park and Ride and there are some really close ones (like the one on State Street) and they said it isn't too bad either! (Plus its free). . Obviously living on campus will be 100% more convenient but commuting isn't as awful as people make it out to be (again, especially those who don't commute!). If you have the finances to live on campus, there are cheap rooms in houses and smaller apartments a little farther out like by the Stadium, too. . . So if you're struggling financially, I would take the commute!

Here is a quick list off the top of my head that arfe differentiators I look at when I'm reviewing the final candidates, and keep in mind the final candidates all have the best grades, from the best schools with the best extracurricular experience, etc.:. . 1) Can I trust this person to perform in front of my customers and my senior management. . 2) Will the person make my job easier or harder. Will the candidate help me to reach my goals, and the goals of my department and company. By the time you interview with me, you should know what these are already, and have a statement how you can help me reach these goals (you figure this out when you interview with my team members before you meet with me).. . 3) Will they be an active life learner? If you're not learning, adapting, evolving all throughout your career...you will not excel over your peers, and I as a manager will not want to invest in you.. . 4) Are you someone that I or members of my team will want to spend long hours teaming with week after week, year after year. Are you likeable? I'm not going to voluntarily add an ass to the team no matter how talented you are. Whether in person or virtually...your peers rely on you for their success, and their well-being as a teammate. When everyone is stressed and challenged..are you going to make this worse, or are you going to contribute to making it better. . . 5) How fast before the candidate is Fire and Forget? Don't take this to mean you will be ignored, but do you have the talent and potential that I could send you to Tokyo on your own to work with a customer, and make me feel confident you've got it all handled end to end. Or even better, how fast before you professionally develop to lead your own teams. No you may not have this experience when you graduate, but know that those of us interviewing you are assessing your potential to be this some day...soon. It's our butts on the line when we hire you, so know that we are pretty damn good at making those assessments of you in a matter of minutes. In my case, you will spend hours interviewing before you get to interview with me. The interview with me will probably be the shortest, 30-60 minutes at most. In cases where I know you've been interviewing all day before meeting me, I will assess your energy level, how will quickly have you learned during those interviews to be able to intelligently ask me questions, but those who stand out, are the ones who already have proposed solutions or ideas when they meet me. . . Lastly, if you are a recent college grad....be humble. Confidence is good, but to think you are the shit because of where you went to school, and what percentile you graduated in is not going to make yourself endearing to anyone. . . My nephew just got hired at Accenture. He was top grade this, top school that...I told him imagine the hiring manager is down to his last 5 candidates. And all 5 candidates are clones of yourself.

If you're more serious about CS, RC might not actually be a great fit - at least in the long term. I graduated with a BS in CS LSA. The further you go into your degree, the harder it will be to avoid north campus. However, you could possibly finesse the system a bit if you eventually decide to take more of a CS route than a humanities route - being a student in LSA means you're subject to their general humanities requirements. Being in RC will probably end up filling out your gen eds pretty easily, and most of the earlier CS requirements are offered on central for LSA students who want to give it a try or fill a requirement.. .

RC requirements are actually fairly straightforward:. 1. a writing seminar, usually taken your first semester. you have to do this in LSA as well, so doing it in the RC isn't a huge deal. in fact, RC writing seminars are often far better than those in LSA, as the classes are far smaller and your professor takes the time to actually get to know you & critique your writing.. . 2. intensive language - it's a yearlong, 8-10 credit per semester requirement to be proficient in a foreign language, but as the RC doesn't offer chinese, you'll actually be able to skirt this one. . . 3. if you're not completing an RC major or minor, you'll have to take four RC classes over four years. you can finesse this one too: the RC offers student-run clubs called ""forums,"" which you can elect for one credit hour and have it count as a class. IIRC, you can count two of these, leaving two regular classes. it's basically being in a student org but having it count towards classes, but it doesn't affect your GPA.. . 4, an arts practicum - however, you can have this count for one of your four RC classes. don't worry if you're not talented; your professor will work with you and help you develop and grow as a creative person.. . all this shit also counts towards your 120 LSA credits & distribution credit requirements. you can 100% do CS & chinese & the RC! if you're concerned about anything or have any questions, you can also reach out to the faculty; they will be glad to talk with you to explore your options and what you want to do. for me, one of the greatest things about being in the RC was meeting people in wildly different disciplines (including STEM/CS majors!) but having that common bond of being in the RC.. . and i mean, if you really hate it, you can stick it out for a year & not take any reqs, then drop after freshman year with no real fuss -\_(tsu)_/- . . source: was an RC peer advisor, graduated the RC with two non-RC majors and a non-RC minor.",1.0,positive,0.8990516066551208

I knew exactly 2 people in Ann Arbor when I moved here. I had a hard time making friends, I was pretty quiet and really intimidated by everyone. It seemed like everyone was already settled into their friend groups and routines by the time I arrived, and it made me scared. I was able to find friends eventually, in hindsight, my friend groups from stemmed from 3 things I did in college:. . * Starting to work at the dining halls. * Taking a summer semester at the BioStation. * Moving into a co-op. . I don't know if any of those are a possibility for you, but all three are really good ways to force yourself out of your comfort zone and into social situations. The co-ops are a lot of fun, and something you could try out for a year, or even a summer semester. The biostation is a great way to take some really cool hands-on classes (do either Summer, or Spring and Summer, not just Spring), but you could also look into NELP or Camp Davis. The dining halls are also great because they pay pretty well, can be started basically at any time, and you don't even need to work that much.. . There are people in my life from all 3 groups that I still hang out with. Hell even one of my current roommates is someone I met working in the dining halls.. . Best of luck to you.

I transferred here as a junior and thought making friends would be easy because of the amount of people here but it's been the exact opposite, because everyone has such hectic lives here.. . Back at my small college where I transferred from, it was really easy to make friends because you see the same people almost all the time in classes, campus, gym, etc. But here I feel like it's really easy to make ""hi-bye"" friends, where you greet each other and talk about ""getting lunch sometime"" and that never really happens.. . I tried joining sooo many clubs, and gained many Facebook friends in the process, but never really any good friends. I rushed a professional frat, and try to go to the meetings and events but most people are just really polite with me, and I find it hard to become close with them too. . . One weird thing that I noticed is that people are really nice to you and pretend to want to be best friends with you when you're drunk here, but when I ask to hang out with them outside eg) study, go catch a movie or a student org performance, they'll come up with some shitty excuse and flake last minute, but whatever, I've been used to doing things all alone now like going to concerts and shows by myself.. . I only have a few months left here, so it feels kind of pointless to be putting in effort to making friends. I went to CAPS and it helped kinda, my parents were Super against it at first because I'm asian and being depressed is equated to having a physical defect or some lame belief like that but like you, I'm running out of visits.. . I cry myself to sleep most days (pathetic, I know) and question if I made the right decision coming here all the time (I sound like an ungrateful cunt but I really do enjoy what I'm studying here, I'm thankful for the opportunity to go to this school, just did not expect being the loneliest I've ever been in my life when everyone else looks like they found their friends and their scene and is having a swell time here). .

The buildings are fine, none are too crusty. I'd honestly say that UMich has a greater proportion of crusty buildings than UMD. Tuition is pretty cheap if you have merit scholarships - I paid I think $6k for my freshman year there. . . I will say that the types of students there are nothing like Ann Arbor. It's probably pretty likely that most students don't study/study less than 2 hours for any given exam. I aced two of the exams in my electrostatics course just by doing a couple practice exams for each exam, and did almost as well as my other exams. I'm not sure how well I actually know calc II content, either, because despite my shaky competence, I set the curve on literally every exam. So, if you're trying to flex on the other students and stand out to your profs, it's much easier than at a large university (like Ann Arbor). . . I can further comment on the types of students with my experience in engineering 100. Of my 4 teammates on our term-long engineering project, 3 were pretty useless. One made our 3d printed objects EXTREMELY poorly, one did \*actually\* nothing, and one actively hurt our project by ordering the wrong parts. The last was a pretty stand up guy and a pretty good student, but I think it's pretty clear that he was the exception, not the rule.. . As for the daily life, on-campus is pretty tame.

First and foremost: CAPS isn't the be-all end-all solution for getting mental help on campus. I've personally had a lot of success talking with the Dean of Students and would actively recommend their services to anyone I know that hasn't had a good experience at CAPS. In my experience, CAPS isn't great because I've been appointed to students or recent grads, and some of my friends have had experiences where their counselors have invalidated their concerns which is a terrible place to be. . Second: you're not alone, not everyone has their shit together and if you haven't already, I'd suggest checking out some of the other posts on this subreddit where other students have had concerns like yours. There you can hopefully find more advice that someone may have left out in these comments, but most importantly I hope you can see that this campus isn't just a social hub of friendship and smiles. Shit's hard, especially if you aren't enjoying your classes as you seem to be stating, and I know what it's like to have family refuse to accomodate mental healthtreatment plans. (As an aside: I've found a couple off-campus therapists that offer a sliding scale of payment options which has been really nice.). . . Third: I know what it's like to come from a big high school and then just not really recognize the people that came here with you, it is definitely jarring but I do hope that you're able to meet new people. Some of the closest friends I have today are people I used to work with (bc I didn't have the best experiences in some clubs and I wasn't taking classes where I could meet people). I'm in my fifth year of undergrad and my social life almost feels like freshman year all over again, but it's never too late to start meeting new people which might in turn help make classes more bearable. Honestly, it's awesome that you're reaching out to the subreddit and I do hope that things get better for you. . . as an aside: your mileage may vary but when I found my mental health deteriorating to the point where I just didn't want to do anything, I kept up a daily habit that was both helpful to me and also not too much work.

If I had to take an educated guess, they're probably doing very front-end, web-development work? Nevertheless, I think its a very narrow scope of the average softdev, and places like cscareerquestions filled with many up and coming softdevs from all backgrounds (tier 3 schools and literally self-taught individuals) would give you a better perspective on what is average rate (50k is probably closer to what most experienced interns are making in non-HCOL areas honestly). . . Additionally, there's a couple problems with the CS compensation (even though I ultimately think if someone is going to come here for OOS undergrad, the only time it makes sense IMO is if they're doing either do CS/CE or Ross). Oftentimes those high compensations are intrinsically tied to very HCOL areas. Places like SF, where you could be paying 3-4k a month for a studio apartment. These places also tend to be not very tax-friendly, especially as you're going to be in an upper bracket. Case in point, I had a friend who had an offer from Amazon (which admittedly is known for underpaying their employees), but he decided to aggressively recruit, because while he had a six-figure salary -- it would have only been roughly 65-70k equivalent in the Midwest when indexing for CoL. I won't comment on stock options, because there's just so much variance in that. There's also the aspect that a lot of people do get weeded out of CS, and it has been getting significantly more increasingly competitive/saturated (more so at UMich as a school) over the last couple years (it's not uncommon to hear of top students who would be feeders to many top tech companies if they graduated back in 2013-2015 not making it quite so far in recruitment).. . .

It is not an ""easy A"" and you only need to study less than 2 hours for the exam. Some classes, sure, but the bigger ones such as chemistry? Calculus? Physics? Biology? Me and my friends struggled through gen chem and put days of studying in advance for the exams. There were not many As in gen chem A and for those of who did get As, we put in a lot of time. I do not have time to enjoy myself from 3pm-1am every day. Maybe people who are taking easy classes; I know that if it weren't for my chemistry and my philosophy of religion class I might have that time, since my other two classes are pretty easy. But for people with hard majors or trying to get into something like pre health or pre engineering? No, it's not a piece of cake. . . I have two friends taking biology 2, which I haven't taken yet, one of them having scored a high 33 on her ACT - and they are both studying days in advance for exams and putting in hard work just to keep up their As.. . And don't get me started on anatomy and physiology, and organic chemistry. Some UMD students take them at schoolcraft or other places just because of how difficult they are here. The brightest students struggle and can't maintain an A.. . I'm not trying to scare you off, it's not as bad as I'm probably making it out to seem. I just wanted to make my point, that not everything is spoonfed to you and that you're actually learning from these classes, i.e. for people who are going into med school they can do well on their MCAT because the classes taught them enough content. The classes aren't hard to the point that you have no life, they usually just end up being time consuming the week before you have an exam. Yes, I've had days where I just binge watch Netflix from 3pm to 1am if there's not much going on, but the week before an exam that does not happen and more effort is put in than ""2 hours of studying"" as someone said. I've managed a high GPA, a part time job, and a decent enough social life attending UMD. . . People who have the time of day to play video games from 3pm-1am on a daily basis are either suffering in their GPAs, waiting to cram everything a few days before an exam, or are taking easy classes.. . Just my two cents as someone who actually goes there, unlike some of the other commenters.. . Edit: I saw someone's comment on a different post who went to both UM Flint and UM ann arbor. They said it's not necessarily true that classes at AA are harder. Depends on the prof and class. Also worth mentioning that some profs teach at multiple campuses, i.e. one of my profs last semester taught both at UMD and AA. So, it would be wrong to say that the AA class was harder.

Professors have so far in my experience been kind and helpful. As for students, I guess what I can say is making friends just depends on the class. In some classes the professor lectures the whole hour and you barely have time to talk, in others we do in class activities (or for lab classes) and you get to talk and work with other students. It's also really diverse here, which I enjoy, although there aren't as many asian or african american students as say whites, middle easterners, or indians.. .

Also, newsflash: unless you're a lawyer, nobody is hiring you based off of where you went to school so long as it is accredited and not some ITT Tech or University of Phoenix bullshit.

Having a degree certainly doesn't mean you can fulfill the requirements of the job, and it's a shame people still think that.

I left the BBA program because I didn't want to do 5 years. I ended up with a 3.3ish GPA and went to work for a local non- name-brand company and I'm headed to a Top 5 MBA program this fall (got accepted to 3 Top-10 schools, including Ross). . . . A big thing was that I had applied my engineering studies to business at my company and showed the relevance of it. One of the admissions officers I spoke to said that my technical experience in a business setting was one of the reasons they had accepted me. Not saying you should do what I did, and the Ross BBA is definitely awesome, but just wanted to let you know it's possible.. . . . ALSO, if you're doing an extra year, be aware that MBA programs generally value work experience over studies, so you'd be possibly putting off applying for another year. IMO if you're planning on doing an MBA, the dual degree may not be worth it, but if you'd like to join a fast-track business career right out of undergrad (and not get an MBA) it'd definitely be worth it.. . . .

Have hw and exams tmrw but I'm writing this now so I don't forget anything and get an accurate summary across to whoever's reading this :). . . . The event starts off with you checking into the hotel, getting free swag (scarf/shirt/event pamphlets) and getting paired up with a roommate. Day 1 activities consisted of touring the Big House (the football stadium) -- we got to see the private suites, locker room, and go out on the field, despite the freezing weather -- and dinner at a local restaurant (there's damn good stuff at Pizza House, take extras home), then we did some icebreakers on Central Campus. You'll have chances to talk with current students (usually kids who've been to Leadership Weekend in the past) which is cool. You arrive back at the hotel around 9 PM.. . . . Day 2: do NOT eat the ""continental"" hotel breakfast (bring/hoard and eat snacks instead), if you're still at the Regent Hotel; it's not very good. Aside from that, we spent most of the day at North Campus and did some weird ""leadership values"" activity where you had to consider your most important values and it involved a lot of self-exploration and contemplation but I thought it was kinda dumb. The workshops later on in the day (you get to choose which one to attend) were more interesting; you get to learn about study abroad opportunities, living-learning communities, community service opportunities, look at some student organizations working (strongly recommend this activity, it's a fun tour), etc. Then you get to explore campus and Ann Arbor in smaller groups; take pictures and bring your wallet! Campus is gorgeous and you'll get to buy souvenirs. Dinner was at a really swanky Italian place (Palio); it was a four-course meal! After that, there's a bunch of teambuilding challenges you have to do with random groups, involving strategizing and communicating with the others. As long as you're cooperative, trusting of others, and determined to find a strategy, most of the challenges can be accomplished; everyone's nice and smart so there's not much room for friction. We got back at the hotel at 10 PM, but a bunch of people stayed for fresh Insomnia Cookies afterwards; I was up until 12 chatting with people, so this is a nice time to get to know people.. . . . Day 3: You have to check out from the hotel early (8 AM) and you eat breakfast at the college this time. Your luggage is locked up in a room while you do closing day group activities and reflections, like anonymous compliments and building LEGOs blind; it's for more teambuilding and communication skill development blahblahblah. We listened to a professor for the closing keynote and afterwards they just herded us onto buses for the airport at different times. Depending on your departure time, you may or may not have time to exchange contact info with your friends, so consider doing so on Night 2!. . . . I think I liked the event overall! Still shook about how freezing Michigan is during the winter though. Aside from weather, the biggest thing that surprised me was everyone at the event was... female. Engineering is pretty male-dominated so I expected some guys but nope everyone's a girl; apparently one year everyone that signed up for the event on first-come-first-basis was female so now the event is female-only (but still first sign up first serve). Everyone's really accomplished, smart, but nice though! The CC post from 2014 I mentioned earlier is pretty accurate; it's 60% social mixer and 40% U-M tour. Wish they could've let us see dorms and dining halls (I guess you could request to stop by those on your small group tours) , let us have more time to ourselves, and lowkey cut down on the inspirational leadership stuff, but the event is still an amazing experience for me nonetheless and I'd recommend anyone do it! Your travel/housing/food expenses are paid in full and you get to meet a lot of awesome people, after all :) Hope someone found this helpful!. . . . EDIT: typos and added more details",1.0,error,0.0

But I am double majoring in two engineering majors, and I know a ton of people in Ross.. . For path 1, a Ross/Engineering double major would definitely not be worth it. I would recommend a CS major with a business minor if you feel so inclined. I don't think a BBA in addition to a CS degree would help at all in getting fast tracked into management (though an MBA will). It would be a much better use of your time to get involved in a consulting club, startup, engineering club. You'll get some hands-on project experience and, since employers like these activities, that'll help you land your first job/internship. Plus, you'll get to network with like-minded people which might help you down the road.. . For path 2, Ross would definitely be useful because, as far as I have seen, they do a better job of supporting entrepreneurs than Engineering. Now I am not saying that you can't launch a successful business as an engineering student, but you'll have to look harder for resources (funding, connections, incubators) rather than having them served up on a silver plate. You're right that it is inherently risky and that having an engineering backup would be a good idea. However, would you be able to balance Ross+Engineering+Startup+Friends+Whatever else? That seems like a lot to bite off.. . Since you're in both engineering and Ross, why don't you try taking some engineering classes and some Ross classes your first year?

This isn't a bad thing unless you either want to go to grad school for theory or you're someone like me who just enjoys theoretical stuff. A lot of CS programs in the country are incredibly theory-oriented and lack a lot of projects, and that's one aspect where UM really shines. Even in EECS 183, which is the intro CS class (if you're not doing it through Engineering), the final project gives you a lot of nontrivial, real-world programming experience.. . One practical area where UM does not have a strong program is front-end stuff or mobile development stuff. Pretty much everyone who comes out of UM CS is either a back-end person or a mix of back-end and front-end. I don't think I know anyone who would really consider themselves a front-end dev from here. The mobile dev class is more focused around entrepreneurship, and the UX class is widely considered to be a joke. The two areas where UM really knocks it out of the park are EECS 482 (operating systems) and EECS 381 (object oriented design). One Facebook engineer said during a talk that of all the schools he's toured during recruiting, there's only one class he's seen that actually does serious, industry-level code review and that's EECS 381.

Also, those notecards are very VERY helpful. Tilted ramp? Top of a roller coaster? Block on top of a block? Pulley with mass with a spring attached to it? Oscillations of a clock? Very specific equations for very specific integrals of moments of inertia? I think I had pretty much every single scenario and diagram I encountered on roulette, homework, and exam problems on my index card. If I had space, I included bullet points from theoretical questions from past exams. I only recommend doing that as a last resort, because let's be real, copying a diagram and shortcut equations isn't going to help you learn. On top of that, the professors like to ask questions that make sure you understand the concepts. Still, it will help get you a few extra points on the exams, which can make a big difference. Many of those same diagrams WILL show up and repeat themselves. . . .

They can discuss your concerns and show you what diagnosis paperwork you'll need to have filled out. If you need to be connected to a mental health provider for the diagnosis, they can recommend some options. . . https://ssd.umich.edu/article/register-mental-health-conditions. . https://ssd.umich.edu/article/ssd-verification-forms. . I personally was diagnosed with ADHD in college. To qualify with SSD, I had to undergo extensive neuropsych testing. (The diagnosis from my pediatrician based on history and short questionnaires didn't qualify, which is fair, since a lot of college students try to fake ADHD. UHS also required that testing to be on file in order to prescribe my medication - again, because people try to fake it to score stimulants.) My diagnosis entitled me to take exams in a separate quiet room and to have time and a half. I usually didn't use the extra time, but I found the quiet room really helpful. My ""VISA"" form that SSD signed to inform professors of my accommodations did not specify my specific disability (you have the option to keep that private) - it only said what accommodations I should be allowed.",6.0,neutral,0.6399809718132019

Unless you're doing something very technical (where what you know is much more important than who you know), the more time spent on things related to course material is actually a complete waste of time.

I know so many kids who have dog shit GPAs, but they invested all of their extra hours into recruiting and networking that they ended up with better jobs than people with decent GPAs (many of which are struggling to find jobs). It's also very rare that someone goes into something that is directly related to their major (unless, of course, they're doing something technical -- but even this doesn't necessarily hold true for non-CS or non-ME majors).. . . . Hell, even if you are doing something very technical (most practical pairing probably being EE and CS), you're still going to get a job that will be relevant mostly to one or the other and only tangentially related to the non-related degree at best.

But to start with a question you didn't ask, let me say this about preview weekends. Socially, preview can be a very overwhelming experience. If you love the social parts of preview, the good news is that you can continue to enjoy those experiences for the next three years, and will have plenty of classmates to enjoy those experience with. But if you hate the social parts, please don't let that turn you off to the school. I've spoken to many students who left preview with the impression that Michigan Law was a party school which attracted only the frat/sorority type. And I'm certainly not here to pass judgment on people who enjoy that. But Preview definitely (although hopefully not anymore) fails to show just how diverse the MLaw experience can be. The vast majority of my classmates loved their time at the law school, and they all have different reasons. . . 1. https://www.annarborstorage.com/info/student I bought a space here during my time at the Lawyers Club. It's not super convenient, but it is (or, at least, was) inexpensive compared to most of the options in town. It was also nice to know that I had a reserved, hassle-free parking spot both during football season and winter. An Ann Arbor bus line(free for students) takes you basically right to the lot too. There's also a few street parking options pretty close to the law school. These probably aren't viable long-term options, but it was nice to know that I could leave my assigned spot and park near the school if I knew I would need my car on multiple days in the same week or two. . 1. No clue about the dining hall options, but I don't think that any of my lawyers club neighbors did this. Especially during 1L, you'll probably want to be in the Lawyers Club dining hall a decent amount. It's super convenient, the food is mostly good, and it's a great way to meet your classmates. You'll get tired of it every so often, but there will also be 3+ lunch events every single day at the law school. Definitely no need to go to a different hall. . 1. The law school will allow you, for elective credit (so generally 2L and 3L) to take classes outside of the law school. But the dean of students must approve first. The Dean when I attended (who has since left) had a pretty relaxed attitude about this, but the courses had to be at the graduate level for everything other than foreign language. Anecdotally, I also don't think that you will want to take classes outside of the law school without very specific career goals in mind. There are enough electives within the law school that cover these topics. . 1. You will absolutely have the chance to interact with people outside of the law school, but not like in undergrad. If you're interested in certain hobbies or sports, you will find people to hang out with. But you're probably not going to want to join undergrad clubs. Remember too that law school student organizations are both a great way to meet the 2Ls and 3Ls you won't see in class, and much more relevant for your resume. . . If I can give you one piece of unsolicited advice, it's this: I loved law school. I met people at Michigan Law who are now the most important to me in the world. Throughout my 3 years, I had so many wonderful experiences that I couldn't begin to list them all here. But (and here's the advice part) never forget that law school is a *professional* school. You're not attending law school to expand your knowledge or to grow as a person; you're attending to enter a profession (or, in some cases, leverage your experiences in law school to enter a non-legal profession). There will be things you don't want to do but should, and things you want to do but shouldn't. My favorite part about Michigan, compared to other top 10 law schools, was that MLaw was the only school that didn't just feel like the final hurdle to the legal profession; it was a place that people wanted to be. That means it's a great environment to spend 3 years in, but it's also very easy to lose sight of the goal. You *can* (and should) expand your knowledge, meet new people, and grow as a person. But you *must* remember the goal.",31.0,error,0.0

We once spent an entire period talking about a novel he was going to write.

Caston: great lecturer. His ancient phil course is very good and a lot of fun. I went in not liking ancient phil and came out loving it. Pretty easy class if you stay on top of your reading. Big class, so I think the average grades are all over the place. . . Anderson: TAKE A CLASS WITH ANDERSON. I recommend her PPE class to everyone. She's famous and a great lecturer. I still consult her slides and readings for law school assignments because you read some very, very important stuff. B+/A- average iirc. .

Anyways, when I was a student my favorite places were these:. . No Thai! - I ate No Thai just about every week in college, granted that was mostly because the club I was with, WolverineSoft, would go up to the Plaza on Plymouth after meetings to grab food before going back and hanging out for the night, but I did love eating their food. My go-to was the Drunken Fried Rice with Beef and either Weak Sauce or Medium depending on how I felt and you get a lot of food for $8.50.. . Mr. Spots - They have a wide variety of ""American"" foods like Philly Cheese steaks, Burgers, and Wings. My favorite place for wings in college was Wings Over Ann Arbor, but unfortunately it's just Over now, so Mr. Spots it is for wings! Seriously though, Mr. Spots is good.. . BTB Burritos - I know lots of people prefer other Burrito places than BTB, but the other ones aren't Ann Arbor exclusives. BTB is mostly known for being a go to after a night of binge drinking, but I contend that they are also good sober. Plus $7.00 for a fairly large, pretty tasty burrito ain't half bad.. . Seoul Street - Korean Fried Chicken may take forever in a day to get, but it is absolutely delicious, and these guys do it well. Worth the wait on occasion.. . Hunter House Burgers - Your Dad's friend will tell you to go to Blimpy Burger while flashing his class of '84 ring at you, and the Upperclassman you went to High School with that is now at Michigan will tell you to go to Frita Batidos, but I'm telling you to go to Hunter House for Burgers, because I legitimately think that they are underrated in the Ann Arbor burger scene. You can get a triple cheese slider and a small fry for less than $7, which satisfies the ""cheaper than food"" promise better than Blimpy who broke it long ago, and it is much closer to campus than either Blimpy or Frita Batidos. By all means, go to all three, they are all good, but if made me choose one, I'm picking Hunter House. . Backdoor Pizza - Who doesn't like a cheap slice of pizza late at night? . .

In economics and finance, arbitrage (, UK also ) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices. When used by academics, an arbitrage is a (imagined, hypothetical, thought experiment) transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs. For example, an arbitrage opportunity is present when there is the opportunity to instantaneously buy something for a low price and sell it for a higher price.. . In principle and in academic use, an arbitrage is risk-free; in common use, as in statistical arbitrage, it may refer to expected profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always risks in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative).. . ***. . ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/uofm/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^]. ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",1.0,neutral,0.8654840588569641

I can't say I learned anything from that class, and most people watched movies or something while he lectured so you kinda have to teach yourself. The exam was a little tricky but I know at least half the class barely cared or learned the material and everyone passed, so I'm fairly certain it's effort based and not score based. There is homework from the text (which he gives you) that takes maybe an hour or two each week. So yeah, the total workload for everything is probably equivalent to a 2-4 credit semester, but it depends how much you want to learn physics. The compromise is that to fit in the physics class in 6 weeks, the class is 3 hours long 4 days a week from 2-5pm.

Movies are difficult to do, and assuming that this was produced with $10, an iphone, some undergrads and Adobe Premiere there's some slack to be given on the finer aspects of this. I guess I'll go through some bullet points anyway. Please don't take anything too harsh, as I understand you guys just did this for fun and all:. . * As others have said, the audio is.. not great. And I think the importance of audio quality something that amateur filmmakers (or even more specifically, budding 'youtubers') underestimate the value of. Good video is easy now. That ""Unsane"" movie was shot entirely on an iphone 7. Good, crisp audio is not as easy. Good audio will make even bad dialogue come off as *professional* if nothing else, bad audio will make great dialogue come off as amateur. I saw your comment saying that you wanted it to sound rough, but I think that when the ""screaming"" scene is our main exposure to the audio it doesn't really *come off* as an artistic choice. . . * I also understand that this was perhaps a choice to make it more 'uncomfortable', but the yelling/screaming feels too over the top. In this scene, we should feel sympathetic to the man outside the car- but as a viewer we feel too ""inside the car"". I think in general it would benefit from being more subtle. Take the viewer outside of the car more. Make the viewer think ""Would I try and intervene in that fight? Is the protagonist going to?"". This builds much more suspense and garners more ""mystery"" to the plot. As it is now, we know that the guy inside the car is batshit insane from the moment he opens his mouth- so the subsequent fight and climax is less surprising. . . * The ""fight"" is.. not great. There's a weird slowmo use, that cutting I think doesn't work in the way it should, there's no noise or even ""hitting motion"" when the girl swings the.. whatever that is at the boyfriend (presumably swings, since we just kind of see her holding it and the boyfriend falls down). . * There should be more time between the girl ""saving"" the protagonist and her eventually betraying him. It comes so immediately after she ""saves"" him that the whole ruse ends up feeling pointless- and there's not enough time for the audience to feel ""safe"" where the twist gives any impact. I know it's a short film, but even 10 seconds would have made a difference.. . * In general, not huge on the name ""Finger Chips"" but that might just be me. . .

I'm from a tech hub, so I knew I wanted to be a CS major, and was able to breeze through the first bit of the program. One of my best friends started it with me with no experience, and I tutored him in the first couple of classes, but by 281 he was lapping me. I saw you are concerned about GPA, but one of the nice things about CS is that GPA is not as heavy a focus when it comes tho recruiting (the occasional company will ask you if you have above a 3.0 and very few companies ask for transcripts). I finished with a 3 flat and have a few friends with even worse GPAs working at top companies. I think it's more important to be able to prove what you know in practice (i.e. contribute to open source, maintain a few personal projects on GitHub that you can show off to recruiters, etc.) than to point to your transcript. A good GPA might help you get an initial interview but practical skills are far more important for once you're writing on the whiteboard. CS is tough, but at the end of the day it's not really as bad as you'd assume from hearing everyone tell you it's really tough. I can't stress this enough, it's built up as an almost Herculean task to complete, but it's not appreciably more difficult than any other engineering major. Finally, the upper level classes Michigan offers for CS are among the best classes I took in college. 485 is the best practical class, 475 is the best theoretical class, and 482 is the best class period (although they have since broken it into a 6 credit and 4 credit class, so I don't know how the 4 credit class is). Stay on top of your work, learn how to Google and read error messages, learn all your tools such as Xcode for your first classes or Sublime and GDB later, meet your GSIs and form study groups and friends who you can work with and you should be fine.

If that's something you can manage without falling behind, then I'd recommend it. Also, I can not stress enough how useful the book is if you haven't tried it already. The structure is different than usual textbooks in that the practice problems are kind of spaced out in between the concepts, so that by the time you finish the concepts for a chapter, the book would have taken you through all relevant material/example problems, and the lecture problems/professor commentary would feel a lot more digestable. I would spend a long evening outlining the book, and then another day powerhousing the homework. However if you don't want to sink your time into the book, I think lecture recordings + discussion is also a viable strategy. The IAs/GSIs seemed like they genuinely wanted to help, especially with their exam review sessions. For exams, plan your sheets out with examples of every proof that could possibly be on the free response portions (as well as whatever else you might need).

Hopefully you can just apply when I learned from 203 to your semester right now and be able to make it to the end of the semester. I took 203 Fall 2018.. . When I took 203 I struggled the entire semester, seriously. So many weird symbols and stuff that just didn't really make any sense to me. Everything was flying by and I was barely holding on by doing the homeworks and ""watching"" the lecture recordings. I really sucked at this stuff and the only thing that got me through the exams were my cheatsheets which I super-loaded. I managed to pass with a sub-par grade so I was pretty happy (still below average on every exam). Now, when I look back at the stuff for some reason I can recognize all of it. Some of my friends who are in the class will ask me to clarify something on the lecture or homework for them and I can actually do it. This reallly baffled me since I did not think I learned anything in that class whatsoever.. . The key is **repetition**. I know every class probably says that but I learned it from this class more than anything. When I was making my cheatsheets and writing literally every single thing in the class down, I was writing and reading each topic over and over and over again. If I had actually tried on the homeworks and kept thinking about each topic repeatedly, listened to the lecture recordings and went to office hours, I would've been listening to the concepts multiple times over to make it really stick in my head. And so I tried this last semester when I took 376 which to me had a very similar lay out as 203 and guess what? I managed to strangely well and this is what really worked for me.. . A lot of people feel bad about going to OH and listening to lecture recordings repeatedly but you SHOULD NOT FEEL BAD. These are all things to help you learn the concepts and the material. A big problem is people treat 203 like a math class and not an EECS class. In your project based EECS classes, you would be looking at the lecture slides for project tips, going to OH for project questions, reading code stuff online to see how specific things work, etc... Well, to really do well in 203 you need to have that SAME mentality (imo). I believe in you OP, you got this!! Hopefully what worked for me will work for you. Don't lose hope :). . . .",7.0,error,0.0

I read the textbook chapters they list in the schedule before each lecture and take notes while I read.

But I'll go ahead and contribute to the dogpile because hey, you're stupid and ripping apart stupid people is fun.. . ""I'd like to remind everyone that by saying he has a right to free speech you are condoning his beliefs and actively defend a racist and homophobic. RACISM IS NOT FREE SPEECH. IT IS VIOLENT SPEECH"". . There are so many things wrong with this. By saying someone has free speech, you're condoning what they say? What kind of slippery slope bullshit is this? Saying someone has free speech means that you recognize that your perspective is just that - a perspective - and that you don't hold it to be inherently superior to anyone else's - certainly not to the point that conflicting perspectives should be silenced. You can call what he's said racist and homophobic, but at the end of the day, those are labels that you're subjectively applying to what he's said, and citing those labels as evidence means you're crowning yourself the arbiter of what is and isn't acceptable. Being right sure is easy if you get to move the goalposts, isn't it?. . ""As well as not being an academic, considering how much actual inaccurate information he spews, there is no reason he should be here"". . Given that ""academic"" is synonymous with ""scholar,"" I'm going to disagree. Shaprio went to Harvard. That makes him an academic. You go to Michigan. That makes you an academic as well. So if being an academic is important to you, how about you act like it? Instead of trying to prove you're right by silencing someone's argument, listen to them, engage them, and defeat them with a better argument. If you're so convinced Shapiro is wrong (he often is) then you should have nothing to worry about, right?. . And because I think it's important to say this, people on both sides of the issues you're railing about (gay rights and racism) are being brainwashed to fight each other so that poor liberals and conservatives fight each other instead of mowing over Wall Street with torches and pitchforks. If you care two shits about human rights, it's your responsibility to recognize that your enemy has brainwashed you and is making you do their work for them.",2.0,negative,0.8453894853591919

The class wasn't too large and it was a really solid introduction to C++. 101 is a good bit easier, but is a much larger class. As an LSA student, you'd be taking EECS 183, which has a difficulty between 101 and 151. 183 is also fairly large afaik. This semester, I'm in EECS 280 which is huge, we have over a thousand students this semester. It doesn't feel too impersonal though because it's split up into enough sections and lots of people don't attend, so the effective class size is smaller. . . You definitely won't be at a disadvantage going in to eecs 183 not knowing anything. They set up the course to be for people who don't have any experience. . . I'm also in EECS 203 which is quite difficult. It's basically a proof math class. It's probably the first actually difficult CS related class, and afaik it doesn't get too much easier.

t1_ehsvycb,2019-03-04 23:15:42,t3_axcppy,t3_axcppy,"To expand on what other people have said, if you've been admitted to LSA, but you'd like to major in something in the College of Engineering, then you'd have to apply to transfer to the college of engineering. There are a small number of requirements you need to have completed or have in progress - from what I remember when I switched into CoE, I think it was: 1) Having completed Physics 140 or some equivalent, including AP Credit 2) Completing a math class on campus 3) Completing an intro coding course (I took EECS 183, other people take ENGIN101 and 4) Completing the first year writing requirement. You should either have these completed or be in the process of completing them by the time you apply. For what it's worth, I know lots of people that transferred into the CoE while in LSA, and I don't know anyone that's been rejected yet. As long as you keep a moderately high GPA, you should be fine. By moderately high, if you have above a 3.5, I'd consider that pretty safe, but I'm not in the admissions office, so I don't know the specifics. . . . . Fair warning, however, double majoring in something in CoE and something in LSA is pretty difficult. CoE and LSA have complete different requirements to graduate. For example, in CoE, you need to have 16 credits of general electives, one 300-level humanities course, and complete both Physics 140 or Physics 240, or equivalents. Then, you'll have major specific requirements - I think for Mechanical Engineering, you'll have all of your mechanical engineering classes, some other engineering electives, and then some upper level math course. LSA has its own set of requirements - you have to 24 credits in ""distribution credits"" - 8 credits in Natural Science (which shouldn't be an issue if you're majoring in something in CoE, because you'll be taking a lot of science prerequisite courses like Physics and Chemistry), 8 credits in Social Sciences, and I think 8 credits in Humanities (? I might be wrong on this one, but it's something like that). For these 24 credits in distribution credits, you can't use AP credit. You'll also have to have 4th semester proficiency in a foreign language, but you can use AP credit for this. There are also other things, like a quantitative reasoning distribution (which, again, you should be fine for since you'll be taking lots of math classes as a CoE major), a Race and Ethnicity requirement, and an upper-level writing requirement. The point of all this is is each college has its own set of requirements to graduate, and you most likely won't see a lot of overlap between those requirements. That's just the general college's set of requirements - that doesn't include the major-specific requirements to graduate. The classes you take for Mechanical Engineering, such as Statics, Dynamics, Controls, Senior Design, etc. don't really overlap well with the classes you'll need to take for Economics. I would say that, before you plan on double majoring, take a good look at each of the required classes for both MechE and Economics, and see if it's even possible to do in 4 years.. . . . I have a friend that majored in both Chemical Engineering and Cell and Molecular Biology - majors in different colleges that have essentially no overlap besides intro chemistry and organic chemistry. He's on track to graduate in 4 years, but that's only after taking basically 18 credits every semester. He also had credit for a foreign language and lots of AP Credit coming in. If he didn't, I think the double major would have taken him about 5 years. . . . . Consider if the double major is something that you really want. Minoring in LSA is pretty simple and a lot easier than double majoring.. .",5.0,error,0.0

I think it's worth a trip and it's just over the river from the UM hospital. Owls of all sorts, vultures, a bald eagle, hawks, turtles, lizards and snakes. All being rehabbed or kept safely due to injury - they all have a story posted outside their enclosures. You can also check out the feeding times of the raptors and go then. The handlers are super nice and informative. Watching an owl down whole dead mouse that's been warmed in hot water is pretty fascinating. There are free bathrooms and drinking fountains (check the hours on this though as they are inside the buildings) as well as a pond and tons of hiking behind the science center.. . On the way home if you take Traver to the Broadway Bridge you'll pass some of the oldest houses in AA - near the RR tracks.

Also someone just lovingly rehabbed the old principals house right across the street from the schoolhouse - it's the newly painted grey and white house with two front doors. That house - I was told by a neighbor - has two front doors because one door was for the principal and the second door was added later as a rental for the teacher. . . You can also stop at the [Northside Grill](http://www.northsidegrill.com/) for a coffee or a bowl of soup (a few bucks) and right next door is the [St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store](http://svdpaa.org/store/) and [Sic Transit Cycles](http://sictransitcycles.com/). Those places aren't especially spectacular but the restaurant is warm and has free papers and a bathroom and I've occasionally found something of interest at the thrift store. The bike shop is cool if you're into biking. Plus all of the people are super friendly. And when you get back over the Broadway Bridge - Kerrytown is full of interesting shops.
