t1_gu9hh61,2021-04-12 15:24:08,t3_mpfifw,t3_mpfifw,"So I was a RC student for two years, as soon as I heard about the additional requirements they imposed, I decided to drop RC after two years ( after guaranteed dorm spot in East Quad was up). I did not take any RC language class (already came proficient in a second language), but I hung out with RC people to long enough to answer your questions.. . 1. Ask it to an RC advisor. One of the few benefits of RC is that their student-per-advisor ratio is very low so you can quickly find an appointment when needed (and in a normal year drop in).. 2. Apart from the intensive language requirement, RC coursework is basically non-existent (4 courses including 1 arts course); however, RC language courses are no joke with up to 10 credits per semester, meeting every day. I had a neighbor drop EECS 183 because they were overwhelmed with RC Spanish. My prognosis is once you are able to finish the intensive language requirement in your first year, RC should be just a breeze; however, given how difficult/ time consuming introductory CS classes are, I'd not suggest doing them with an intensive RC language course.. 3. Yes, RC requirements mostly satisfy LSA requirements but usually not the other way around. Always shoot a brief email to the advisor if you need additional clarification. 4. As I explained in 2, RC language classes are intensive, meaning they cover twice the material a regular language class does in a semester. Given that learning a language is always time consuming, you can imagine how time intensive the classes can get. They range from 8 to 10 credits per semester, which is equivalent to 2-3 classes. I personally would not suggest taking EECS 280 or 281 while taking a intensive RC language (and even EECS 183 can be overwhelming if you lack previous coding experience). As for RC courses satisfying LSA requirements, a RC course coded as Social Science/Humanities would satisfy the LSA requirement for Social Science/Humanities but an LSA course would not satisfy the RC requirement. If I recall correctly there is 1/2 RC requirements that do not overlap with LSA (Arts class being one) and so RC requirements are in general more burdensome than LSA. . . . Overall my suggestion would be to weigh in the pros and cons. You can always get into the RC, but opt to drop out later on if you don't like it. In fact more than half the students drop out after their second year. There are benefits to RC, such as more interesting and easier first year writing classes, but there are also disadvantages such as additional requirements that might not overlap with those you are already taking.. . TLDR: Accept, talk with an advisor, drop out of RC if you don't like it.",4.0,error,0.0

The RC is a smaller college within the college of LSA, which is within the University of Michigan. The RC isn't separate from LSA, it's just a smaller subset of it. . 4. There are no real disadvantages. I think it's one of the best choices I made. You inherit a community right when you walk onto campus, which makes the big school a lot less intimidating. You also meet all sorts of fun and interesting people, and the biggest plus is that you live in East Quad, which I think is the best dorm on campus by far.

I personally live on North Campus, which is really quiet. I love it--the first thing I noticed when I got there was how many trees there were, which was something I missed from where I live. People tend to prefer Central Campus since it's closer to downtown, and by extension, the parties, but North Campus might fit well for you if you're looking for a place that's a little less densely populated.

t1_gub474n,2021-04-12 22:45:38,t3_mpkjnf,t3_mpkjnf,"I'm getting the sense that you have some misconceptions about what work-study does, which is completely understandable because most people have no idea what it does. It is different than other financial aid in that **work study is** **not automatically applied to tuition/fees or room/board.** You earn the money, it comes directly to you, you decide what to do with it.. . For a lot of students, work study is functionally identical to a regular job. You'll get paid every two weeks (or every month, or every week, depending on the employer) like normal, and you'll get the same pay rate as non work study students if you're both working the same position. If you want to use this money to pay for tuition, go for it. If you want to use it to pay for groceries, that's great. If you want to use it to go on a cruise, you can do that too (your parents might judge you a bit, but the IRS isn't gonna come after you). . . So how is it different than not having work study? A few ways: for work study jobs, half of your wage is paid by the government. It's illegal to pay a work study student more than a non work study student for the same position, so this won't get you more money at the same job, but it could get you a job that's only available to work study students (it's legal and fine for someone to only hire work study students). There are some neat jobs that only hire work study students; you can take a look at the [student employment website](https://studentemployment.umich.edu/) to see what's up there right now. Additionally, when you report income on the FAFSA in the future, income earned through work-study is reported separately from other work income, and gets removed from the calculations. So it won't count against you in the future (you won't get less financial aid in a few years because you busted your ass at your work study job this year). . . The biggest downside is that work study is limited, in your case to $3,000. For the jobs that only hire work study students, that means you'll have to work it out with your employer so that you're only getting that much money over the course of the school year. So if you need more than $3,000 over the course of a year, you'd need a second job at some point. However, for on-campus jobs that hire both work study and non work study students this isn't a problem at all, they'll just switch things in payroll once your award runs out and you can keep working there. I know for sure that this is how things work in the Dining department, nothing really changes on your end even when you earn more than your award (source: worked in Dining as a work study student). The final downside is that at U of M, work study students are limited to 29 work hours per week. For most people this actually isn't a downside at all, because working that much and doing well in school at the same time is super super tough. . . TL;DR: work study is basically the same as a regular job, the only differences are that it may open up more positions, it doesn't count against you for financial aid in the future, and there are work hours/earnings limits. There's no real downside to accepting a work study award and then not using it. . Let me know if you have any follow up questions, other commenters have pointed out some solid benefits to certain jobs (research is great, etc.)",2.0,error,0.0

One warning that I wish I received before signing up for LAE: be prepared to write quite a bit for the required UART class. I'm not sure whether they changed UARTS 150, or the UART class requirement, but since it fulfills the first year writing requirement, there's around 3 essays involved. The essays prompts are thought provoking, but I found them pretty hard to write. Not many people liked UARTs 150 when they were taking it, but it became a bonding experience and we did have an opportunity to do some art in that class.

I am wary about the expensive tuition fee at UMich. As an international student, I would have to take out loans to cover my expense here. Whereas, UCSB is comparatively cheaper. I believe the tuition fee for UCSB is around $32k whereas it's around $52k for UMich. Does the prestige of UM offset the extra cost?. 2. How are the job opportunities for someone graduating from UMich vs a UCSB grad? Is there any major difference?. 3. I also believe UCSB has comparatively more TA and RA positions compared to UMich. This is also one reason I am leaning towards UCSB. I have heard that getting GSI/GSRA positions at UMich is slightly harder for MS students. Please correct me if I'm wrong.. .

So contrary to popular belief, your major actually DOESN'T determine your degree type (at least not in LSA at umich). The only difference between a BS and a BA is that to get a BS you need to complete a total of 60 or more BS credits. BS classes are basically any science/math classes, and on the LSA course guide, you'll see that the BS classes are labeled as ""BS"" along with any other distribution requirements they fulfill. If you pick a science/math related major, it's not too hard to complete the 60+ BS credits. It doesn't really matter what your major is tho or how many majors you have so you can get a BS in History if you want or a BS with a double major in American Culture and Spanish (basically whatever you want). If you don't complete the 60+ BS credits, usually your only choice is a BA which I guess is the ""default"" degree.. .

This sounds bad but at some point returning to normal is more important. For example, if we were guaranteed only one person would die of covid would the whole world be social distancing? Of course not. We would go back to normal because, as morbid as it is, it's not worth it. It's not just about money and the world economy, it's about people who have undoubtedly developed depression over the past year, people who are going to college later, graduating later, people who can't find jobs, problems with global shipping which affect not only our everyday Amazon bs but also vital support for communities around the world. At some point the benefits are not worth the cost. I feel like 95-98% of the population being vaccinated is way over that threshold",5.0,negative,0.5326222777366638

North and South Dakota are doing pretty well rn. They have almost no covid restrictions but they also have the highest number of covid cases per 100000. They're 9th and 13th in deaths per 100000. The 3rd state in cases per 100000 is Rhode Island. They have strict covid restrictions and enforce their rules pretty well. On the other end of the spectrum there's Texas with no covid restrictions (they're still ahead of the national number of cases per 100000 so they aren't some gold standard we should strive for) and they're doing well and there's Florida with very lax covid restrictions, same as Texas, and they're doing pretty bad. My point is, there's so many variables like vaccination rates, population density, testing capacity, hospital beds, median age etc. that you can't compare 2 states like that.

Cons:. . - You might like your job/ get used to making money and decide to not return to school (this is a totally fine btw. you still rock!). . - You might not finish grad school until you are almost 30 (also totally fine) . . - you might not want to disrupt whatever life you build for yourself after graduation (the pandemic killed my social life, so it was not a huge factor for me). . .

I emailed the transfer team at LSA shortly after I read your initial reply and they told me pretty much exactly what you just said. . . I plan on submitting that request once my final transcript goes through after graduation this year, so hopefully some good comes of it, but if not, I can always reapply for the Fall 2022 term. I'm guessing that them pooling me in with other winter term applicants would likely boost my chances due to the simple fact that not as many people apply for the winter semester as they do for the fall semester. . . The office told me my chances would be greater if I attended another institution for at least three terms (so 1.5 years), which would put me in the best position around the Winter 2023 term which seems like such a long ways away, but there's still a chance I can get in earlier hopefully!

I think lot of your points are very good so I'll only address the few that I think I can add to. . * If you're considering applying to business school, I think Ross has an overall better BBA program, and allows for much more flexibility in your curriculum. Stern has the advantage of being in NYC, but recruiters come to Ross anyways. Ross sends enough people to NYC that I'm not sure if the location is really any disadvantage. . * The point above applies to your concern on recruiting as well. Recruiting in NYC is great but companies fly their recruiters to Ann Arbor and fly UMich students to offices for interviews. I don't think you should be worried about this. * Sure, 50% of students are in state, but because Michigan is so much larger, you have much more people from any background than NYU in absolute numbers. I'm international myself and I'm happy with how diverse the Michigan community is. I surely learned a lot from people of many different backgrounds. . * You are definitely gonna make a new group of friends here, and so what if you see your ex on the street once in a while?. * IDK how NYU is with getting classes. Michigan's system isn't perfect but I've gotten to take all the classes that I wanted and needed to take without any issues. Intro-level course have spots reserved for new students, other than that, people with more credits gets to register earlier, so if you're really worried about this take more classes per semester or transfer more in.

I think the bonus of going to such a large place is the sheer amount of opportunities you are afforded, with the various student orgs, athletics, and people you meet. . . A big part of education is applying the knowledge you gain outside of the classroom. Look at the clubs that you can join at each place and compare what you like about each one you find. Maize Pages is the name of the online database of all the clubs, and you can search by keywords, subjects, and other criteria.. . Also, while your earlier classes will be with hundreds of other people, the farther you get in your program, your classes will likely get smaller. Obviously, I can compare the quality of education between places based on personal experiences, but I would imagine that professors anywhere can be hit or miss, depending both on how they teach and how you learn. In my first year of mostly intro classes, I would say that I've had one truly awful professor, with the rest ranging from great to ok (again, this is my personal experience).. . Finally, fwiw, there is club swimming at UMich, so you may want to look into that.

You can choose how much time you want to spend with the minimum being 6 hours, and I was lucky to get a really understanding lab where it was ok if we couldn't get anything done that week, and they weren't at all strict on approving hours.

It's nice to have the separation from school and home, since North Campus is quieter. . . Speaking about social life, I know a lot of organizations and CoE as a whole are planning to help with that transition to in person, since this years freshman class also has never been in person. I'm a part of Engineering Student Gov and we're planning a back to school event! Welcome week will happen for sure, it's just depending on how comfortable you are with covid and all that. people were pretty good about not having parties this year but with more people being vaccinated, who knows. I recommend buying football tickets!!. . You have a ton of options that you don't even know of. I'm interning with Stryker this summer, I know people who go to boston scientific, medtronic, medline, J&J, GE healthcare! And we have smaller companies nearby as well! As long as you take advantage of opportunities, you'll be fine. Get involved in clubs, not sure of your identities but Society of Women Engineers is one of the largest engineering organizations and hosts a ton of professional development and company info sessions to the entire CoE, or your sophomore year, Tau Beta Pi, an honor society, NSBE, all of those are great. . . I don't think $150k is really an ideal goal, but I know median starting salary is right around $75k and you go up from there. With a Masters and all that, you're just adding money. You have room to grow and if you go back for an MBA, you'll be closer to that $150k!. . To get into SUGS, you need a 3.2, which is super duper attainable. Most of our upper level classes have a median around an A-. As long as you do relatively decent your freshman year in pre-reqs, you'll be fine. I just recently got mine above a 3.5, but I haven't heard of any problems if you have more than a 3.0 when it comes to job offers. . . With the transition back to in person, you'll have a ton of opportunities to do hands on stuff! I recommend looking into Engr 100 section 100 or section 500, as those are BME focused. 500 does more clinical need whereas 100 is more a material design, but no actual building. You'll also have labs associated with the 200 levels, you'll take junior design, 458 is bio instruments, we've made an ECG, pulse ox, and an EMG set up this semester, all starting out with a blank breadboard. Then, you can take senior design, either 451-452 cor a full year or 450, there's a medical device section and a biochem section. I'm taking the year long course so I can double count with SUGS :). . Research and project teams are a huge plus in internship finding. It's uncommon to get anything after your freshman year, and it's difficult but definitely possible after sophomore year. Most people study abroad or take classes after freshman year, then either do research or and internship after sophomore year! I wouldn't say internships are super hard to find, they are competitive tho, so you definitely need to have great networking skills. Joining a student org or attending workshops can help with that. And apply to every thing, go to every bme company at the career fair, attend the small events, introduce yourself even as a freshman. I promise, if you keep coming back, they will remember you. That's how I got my stryker interviews, the recruiter remembered me from my freshman career fair. . . i'm super happy to answer questions, navigating the beginning of college is super confusing and i'm definitely here to help!

The experience of a double major definitely would vary depending on what your two majors are, but there are some things that remain the same. . . You need 120 credits to graduate, regardless of your major(s). There's something called distribution requirements -- you need 7 credits each of humanities, social science, and natural science, and there's a bunch of other distro requirements too.

After I realized I liked some ""pure math areas"" more (analysis, topology, etc.) I promptly changed my concentration (but not on paper yet, for reasons related to waitlist priority). But I can tell you a decent amount, based on my experiences and those of the other financial math majors I know.. . Classes are okay. They got harder recently as the requirements just changed. You'll have to complete classes in differential equations, analysis, probability, stochastic processes, theoretical statistics, and three ""financial math"" classes, of which I'm told two are okay and the third (in stochastic calculus) may get hard. It's not a cakewalk by any means, especially since it got harder, but as far as math majors go here it's not that bad. . . The 217-451-525-526 (and now tack 474 at the back of it) sequence in particular is fairly demanding, abstract and proof-based.. . Some of these classes have numbers in the 500s. That's okay. They're accessible to undergrads, and with the math department (many exceptions exist, be warned) an accurate way to gauge how hard some upper levels are, I'm told, is to subtract 200 from the class level. 525 and 526 (probability and stochastic processes) are very doable. . . A frequent complaint I hear is that there isn't enough finance in the major and it's too mathy. I also hear complaints from the other side, that there's not enough (pure) math. I don't know enough to make an educated guess on where you'll lie, but just know it can be polarizing. . . With regard to internships, counseling and recruitment, the financial math majors I know are doing well. They often complain that the math department doesn't help very much with it though. I wouldn't rely on the program for it, and don't count on receiving support on top of what the LSA gives you. . . Lastly, I don't know if this applies to you, but I've seen this happen enough that I think it has to be said. You probably shouldn't major in this if they were looking for a Ross/business/finance alternative, but if they enjoyed proofs and like math, then they should go ahead and do it. This is not a typical degree in finance, and shouldn't be thought of as a Ross replacement. If you do it, you will be a math major, and that should say enough about it. . .

I am a CS major going through LSA and I can say that I generally think I have learned much more here than I would have at MSU. I am currently about to finish EECS 280 so I can't say much about EECS 281, but if you are worried about getting help via office hours anything related to the course (projects, labs, etc) it's not too bad if you try to solve your issues earlier than later. Based on my own experience with office hours queue wait times is that the closer it is to an exam or project due date, the harder it is to actually get in with someone to help. So as long as you start projects on time and not push anything off, then you won't have any issues there. The classes at UofM compared to MSU definitely expect more from their students in my opinion. During my time at MSU I could push off studying the course material and then cram last minute for an exam and pull an A. They test you more on material that you learn throughout the class and do not give any real study material, other than just saying to study the chapters that the exam covers. Labs are not hard at all again if you have done everything that was expected of you and that you are not behind on the material. I would agree with other people who commented before that most of the negative aspects you heard about being a CS major at UofM are mainly hate comments of students expressing their frustration in not doing well in a course because they probably did not put in the required amount of time to succeed. I am group partners with another MSU transfer student for EECS 280 projects and even he agrees that it has been more beneficial taking courses here at UofM, rather than cs courses at MSU.

t1_gvdes5p,2021-04-21 21:26:51,t3_mvopcs,t3_mvopcs,"I would say that the other answer which explains all three majors separately does a fair job of assessing each one.. . I cannot speak for chemistry and biochemistry, though from what I understand most of that is more on the theoretical side compared to ChE.. . Now chemical engineering I can fully explain. Chemical engineering is learning all about applying some of the concepts of chemistry and other fields like physics to more industrial processes. The goal is to map out a full process of taking in raw products and converting them into something useful. The first class is learning about material and energy balances, which is a way of accounting for the principle of energy and matter is not created or destroyed, only transferred. Then, you take a course in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Fluid mechanics is more oriented towards macroscopic processes (think of flow through a large pipe), though there are also parts which describe microscopic fluid flow in more detail. Thermodynamics describes how to mathematically model certain properties that are difficult to physically calculate (properties like Gibbs Free Energy, Entropy, Enthalpy, etc.), and it builds upon the concepts of the first course of material and energy balances, getting more into practical examples of thermodynamic models, like heat engines and refrigeration/liquefaction cycles. From this foundational knowledge, you move onto separations, which details how to separate mixtures of the same phase or of different phases, and mass and heat transfer, which is relatively straightforward based on the name. From there you take a couple more courses like reaction kinetics (since who cares if you can find out how to make a bunch of a product if it takes 100 years to reach completion?).. . Overall, chemical engineering is definitely more process oriented and has a focus on problem solving. I came in thinking I like chemistry and math and so I went ahead and applied for it. I enjoy it immensely, but it's not for everybody. Be very careful when deciding chemistry or chemical engineering.

Is the program 70% better here than at the place you're looking at, both in terms of the in-class experience and the opportunities you get to demonstrate that experience through internships, extracurriculars, and connecting with others in your program. UMich has an abundance of people in most majors at CoE, several top notch project teams (I can vouch for solar car, but most of the teams are very competitive and all are very fun), and an extensive alumni network that can connect with internships all over, as well as several career fairs and networking events through the CoE.. 2. What's the outcome gap? This is more on the pragmatic side, but what do the outcomes for people in your program look like at each place? If you have to take loans, how long would it take you to pay them back. From this aspect, if you are able to afford the extra 10k/year, I would say the benefits of a better outcome likely outweigh the cost, but that is certainly going to depend on your financial situation.",7.0,positive,0.5311311483383179

He cited six offline books for that single sentence, so tracking down all six books to show that the cited references do not support what he wrote would be grueling.. .

Currently, online exams are horrible in the eecs department with regards to cheating. If you look at exam statistics for EECS 370 and 376 they are much more skewed to the right than usual, and statistics across the board are higher than ever, despite the exams being harder than previous semesters. This makes the curves very weird and unfair to students who worked hard. For instance, last semester in EECS 376, I know someone who had a high 50% in the class and got a B- and someone who had a high 80% and got a B+, ridiculous. I'm pretty sure the professors are aware of this skew since they were reluctant to give grading ranges for 376, 370, and 281. This is a huge issue that I think needs to be brought up if online courses in EECS are to continue, because it's gotten so bad at this point it makes students who actually work hard and understand the material be punished for not cheating. These issues are especially prevalent in the eecs department, I am a dual major in math and we don't experience these issues, the exam statistics are not overly skewed despite being online. This might be due to the fact that the EECS department is very competitive and it is hard to proctor such a large amount of students.. .

t1_gvtmqy7,2021-04-25 14:54:24,t3_my8anf,t3_my8anf,"I'm in the unique position of having done both! Specifically, I did my first two years of a CS Specialist and Math Major at UofT, then finished my degree at UMich as a CS-LSA + Honors Math major. Which probably makes me like the most qualified person in the world to answer this question.. . . . There are a lot of differences and advantages they have over each other. One of the most major/general differences is that CS at Michigan is under the Engineering school (though you have the option to take it through LSA), while at UofT it's under Arts & Sciences.. . . This might seem like a superficial difference, but it's not. It's a microcosm of the ""flavor"" of CS at the universities: in particular, UofT CS has more of a theory flavor than UM CS. UM CS has more of an engineering flavor. The theory courses are stronger and *much* more plentiful at Toronto, while I found the theory-course quantity at UM lacking. On the other hand, UM Programming-based courses are stronger than their Toronto counterparts.. . . This is reflected culturally among the students: UofT CS students liked math. All of my CS friends there were math majors. UM CS students hate math. One of my biggest culture shocks here is how much people *hated* math and theory courses here, even though similarly difficult or harder courses at UofT didn't incite such complaints. . . . . Probably *the* **most major difference** is POSt, which I'm sure you already know about. The average you need between the intro CS courses in order to declare the CS major is very high at UofT - last I checked it was like, 85% (A average) for instream. When I declared, it was 83%. The Michigan declaration threshold on the other hand is practically non existent in comparison, you pretty much just have to do better than pass. I know people who transferred from other great unis (like Washington) to Michigan, because of the low declaration threshold.. . . Some other more specific differences:. . * At UMich you have the option to do either CS-LSA or CS-Eng; these relate to what breadth requirements you have to do. I did CS-LSA so I can only speak for that.. . * UMich (CS-LSA) has **much** more distribution requirements than UofT - stuff you have to do that's outside your major. Can't speak for CS-Eng.. . *The above can be alleviated if you have a lot of proficiency in a foreign language - one of the distribution requirements is you take courses in a foreign language, which you can get waived if you test-out of the language.. . * Campus-wise, UMich is sprawling, and going between North and Central campus on bus is a pain. OTOH, all my UofT classes were within a couple of city blocks.. . * I've found the students to be generally brighter at Toronto. . . Which do I prefer? Well I'm a theory guy, so you should be able to guess that. Overall if you're also more interested in the theory/math side of things, I recommend Toronto. If you're more looking for software-engineering, Michigan has better courses in that regard. But I'd like to emphasize you can't go wrong either way - both unis are still great generally speaking at theory and applied, I'm just comparing the marginal differences.

Umich pros:. - Love the RC. - Has my major, comparative lit. - Good fin aid (only pay $2k and a $5500 fed loan) . - Not in my second major but was told by the teacher that I have a shot of getting it the second year. - Am interested in taking a few CS classes and I can at umich. - Love how big the campus is, lots of spaces to breathe it seems . - not so sure on law school atm. - amazing grad school placements for my second major. . UMich cons:. - Super cold and far away from any city I want to live in. - I have to submit a few transfer applications just in case I don't get my second major. - Not *as* prestigious, but still #24 and seen really well so this isn't a con, most people I've met have never heard of JHU so I guess it differs on location. . JHU Pros:. - Really good humanities programs for my majors of interest. - A tiny bit better prestige. - Pretty cool research opportunities. - Closer to cities and has good humanities grad school placements. - Has *okay* grad school placements for second major. - Have heard language programs are great. . JHU cons:. - am not sure on law school so if I wanted classes where I could learn hard skills like CS I can't because that's in the school of engineering. - I will have to submit a transfer app here even though I can get a major (not technically in JHU yet, not explaining why) which should be fine as long as I do well, just risky. - Most expensive school on my affordable list for my family . - Hated the area of Baltimore the school is in. - Expected to move off campus in the area I hated . - Didn't really see much of JHU's campus in particular so I don't really have a comment, but it looked like the humanities building was small. . I'm just not sure if I should do JHU because of the quality of their humanities programs, but I love the RC and think Michigan has amazing programs too.

t1_gvw5919,2021-04-26 03:44:16,t3_myome4,t3_myome4,">Several years ago, while I was a grad student at UM, I was working on a web-based program visualization tool that we wanted to try out for some of the EECS 280 lab exercises. My advisor and I set up a meeting with someone from DCO to request a server to host the tool, but I was running about 10 minutes late, and the meeting was over by the time I got there. My advisor decided to just pick a name, ""EECS 280 Labster"", because we were going to use it for the labs. I wasn't crazy about the name, but it was sort of funny because it sounded like ""lobster"".. . >My brother, Jon, also happened to also be a GSI for 280 at the time. He drew the Lobster in MS Paint during the downtime between answering questions in one of his lab sections and sent it to me in an email with nothing but the subject line ""EECS 280 Lobster"". So the lobster became kind of an inside joke among the 280 IAs and GSIs. Over the course of the next several years, he drew several variants of the lobster and a few other sea creatures, and they sort of evolved into ""mascots"" for 280. There are over 100 different ""lobster"" pictures, some of which you can find on our course website or occasionally posted on Piazza, but most are considered quite rare and few people have seen them.. . >The program visualization tool I was working on eventually evolved into what's now at lobster.eecs.umich.edu, and I just decided to rename it to ""Lobster"".. . --James Juett's answer from Winter 2019 Piazza",327.0,neutral,0.8658401966094971

I was exactly in the same spot as you, so here's a little bit about my thought process and experience so far:. . When I was deciding which to go to, one of the things I considered was the alumni relations. Everything I was able to find several years ago mentioned how Toronto's alumni base wasn't very large, nor were they very friendly resources (maybe this is inaccurate). On the other hand, everything I read about UMich showed a strong alumni base that were willing to help students out. I didn't really notice how much this matters until this past year while I was on the e-board of a student org, and we got emails every week from alumni asking if we had any members that would be interested in various workshops/internships/part-time positions. This provides not only a great networking/professional opportunity, but also a chance to get some advice.. . Additionally, while Waterloo has an amazing Co-op program, I haven't heard as much about UofT's, so I can't really speak on how it would help you. I can speak on how UMich's program has helped me get internships though. The summer after my freshman year I interned at a small insurance company writing automation scripts, the summer after my sophomore year I interned at Quicken Loans as a software engineer, and this upcoming summer I'll be interning at Amazon as a SDE. I don't have the best grades nor the worst, I'm sitting at a 3.3 GPA, while most of my friends are at 3.6-3.8. This goes to show that you'll be surrounded by smart people, but if you work hard, then you can definitely get into really competitive internships. I've had friends that interned at Google, Facebook, SpaceX, Tesla, AI startups, Citadel, Robinhood, etc. . . All in all, coming to UMich over UofT has been the best decision that I have ever made. I haven't regretted it once over the past 3 years, and I'm a little sad that I'll be graduating in a semester.",6.0,neutral,0.764778733253479

The people running the program genuinely care about you and your success and they become a great resource for internships, academics, scholarships, etc. For me, the program was also sort of a free trial run of real classes, and helped me see what works and what doesn't when it comes to learning/studying without risking actual grades/GPA. I flat out bombed their version of MATH 115 during the summer, but learned from it and got a A- in the real class.

Cons:. . * expensive (68k a year), especially since I might want to save money for grad school.

I'm not sure how else I would be able to get to clinicals. * party school- I guess this is sort of positive and negative. I'm definitely not a huge partier/drinker, but I know there's a lot of students at UMich who aren't into that either. * Far from home (9 hour drive) and would probably have to fly. . Pitt Pros:. . * Close(r) to home (5 hour drive). * good nursing program, but not the best. * in the city, there's lots to do (I've always envisioned myself going to a city school). * VERY cheap compared to my other offers (only pay 16k a year as I got a scholarship), so I wouldn't have to take loans for grad if I wanted to go. * Clinicals are all close by, so easier to get around. * Lively campus. . Cons:. . * not as ""prestigious"". * other STEM majors aren't as strong as UMich. * less academically rigorous/won't challenge me as much. * Not in love with the off campus housing options, which I heard is what most students opt to go for after freshman year. * Not in love with the campus like UMich. . I guess it really comes down to what I prioritize, but I don't want to just go with what seems like an obvious answer without really considering the whole picture.

The more pertinent issue there is that the regions in the world most afflicted have weak institutions and . rampant corruption, which aren't entirely solved by economic systems. . . I think the bigger issue here is that, while a communistic society sounds good on paper, it's highly unlikely to be implemented in reality without some pretty serious violations of individual liberty, or an expansion of a central state several orders of magnitudes beyond the scope of our current system of governance. Again, nations like the Soviet Union and Maoist China were founded on variations of Marxist principals in theory (to implement a dictatorship of the proletariat to eventually transition to a classless, stateless society) but were all afflicted by illiberal issues like media censorship, ""vanguard"" one-party governance, and flawed democracies where candidates were chosen in advance by the party. All these mechanisms were intended for those on top to hold on to power, directly opposite to the founding ideals of their countries!. . Simply put, it's too easy for cutthroat strongmen to manipulate communist systems of government to their whim. Furthermore, with power centralized in this way, corruption runs rampant, causing inefficiencies and shortages in the general dispersal of goods and services. And as a final cherry on top, scientific and engineering innovations are often stifled in these countries except in the fields the central government deems relevant, most likely for the military.

There is no such thing as an under developed country. Instilling far-right dictators (which more often than not leads to corruption) is something capitalist imperialist powers (i.e, united states) does literally ALL THE TIME. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_involvement\_in\_regime\_change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change) They look to privatize national goods, open markets, cut labor laws, allow high exploitation of their people, etc.. . Also, You really feel like the characteristics of democracy that exists in the United States are any different than what you listed? Media censorship, check. One party governance, check. Candidates chosen by party leaders beforehand, check. All of ""these mechanisms that were intended for those on top to hold on to power, that directly oppose the founding ideals of their countries"" EXIST TODAY, IN THE UNITED STATES. If you think otherwise, do some research on the founding fathers, who they were, what they stood for, and (most importantly!) their economic positions. Spoiler alert, they were all of the bourgeoisie. Representative democracy is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.. .

I wasn't exactly hyped to take additional humanities/social sciences/natural sciences, nor did I like the one Honors course I did take (Stats 280), nor did I like my Honors advisor. I also didn't really want to spend extra time getting Honors Points and all that. The ultimate outcome of successfully completing the Honors program is the ""graduated with Honors"" (or something like that) text on the degree, and there are other perks along the way as people mention, but I decided all the strain I would put on myself was not worth it. Being at U of M as a ""normal"" student is an honor enough as it is (and difficult enough as it is), I feel. That being said, if you think you would enjoy doing all of the stuff that Honors entails, then go for it. If you don't think you'd enjoy all that stuff, then don't go for it. Or, you could do what I did and just try it out for a semester and see how it goes and decide if you like it or not after that. There's plenty of people who enjoyed the program and at least 1 person who didn't (me), so it's hard to give a definitive answer beyond it really depends on the person.",2.0,neutral,0.5942541360855103

I did not feel like the SI program had enough practical application where I felt prepared for either of my internships. I think there's a bit too much emphasis on the academics and literature than practical application (for example, UW's HCDE program seems to be the best it gets for career prep). Don't get me wrong, a lot of people get amazing jobs after graduating from UMSI -- but from my experience all of the people I know who got great, high-paying jobs post-grad had to do a LOT of extracurricular work in order to do so. There are other programs who weave that as part of their curricular design if that makes sense. So while there are many people who leave the SI program to becoming pretty successful, there are just as many, if not more, who really struggle with landing a good job offer after the case.

Your textbook is Otto Bretscher 5th edition, and other than a few assorted sections, you basically read that cover to cover in order for the class. I would recommend at a minimum reading the key theorems, but it is advisable to still read all the sections.. . . Tips: . -It is extremely important that you read and understand every theorem you cover. Do not memorize the theorems, you have to fully understand them. When you are reviewing, you should be able to prove how these theorems were derived. This is the best way to prepare for the exams and Homework.. . . -The homework part B's are absurdly hard. Go to office hours and they will give you the answer though. Once again it is vital you fully understand the answer, the exams are almost exactly like the homework part B. . . . -The exams are about 70/30 proof vs computation based. Practice the computation when you are studying, you want to make sure you get that 30% on the exam because the rest of the exam (about 5-6 of the 8 questions) will be extremely hard proofs like your homework B.. . . -In class quiz grades pretty much don't matter at all, don't worry about them but obviously try your best. . . . -On your webwork homework you can use symbolab if you need to. Just make sure you understand how to do the computation. . . . -I felt like complete ass after leaving every exam, DO NOT WORRY, you probably did ok. The standard deviation on the exams is really high, so you will not fail the class. I thought I got 20's on exams where I ended in the 70's with a B+.. . . -You can't study for these exams at all other than the computation. It kinda sucks. I would just make sure you spend all your brain power on homework part B. Spend at least 12 hours on the homework and you shouldn't need to study at all for the exams. . . . -Go to office hours a lot to clarify key concepts, not just for homework. There are a lot of people with a ton of office hours, you should be able to find one.. . . -Lastly, I will warn you that this class is a time dump. It has super long paper homework, online homework, long lectures, and long readings that are hard to parse through. It was basically a full time job.

Anything more it'll get to the point where I will burn through my grant money. At that point I won't be able to afford coming here anymore and all the effort would've gone to waste.

UROP is supposed to make that whole process so much easier and it sounds like you might not have had the help and advice from the program that you should have had. . . The big piece of advice I have is to expand your expectations at least a little. Don't give up on those projects that really fascinate you but also look into ones that might not be subject relevant to your major, but still help you practice helpful skills you can apply elsewhere. Those are still things (and often the most important things) that you can put on a resume. . . When it comes to emailing professors, that is always daunting so you aren't alone in feeling anxious about reaching out. Something that might help (and something that is just good to get in the habit of doing) is reaching out for more of an informational interview. This is easier to do when you're taking their class, but professors love to talk about what their doing and researching. By starting the conversation like that, you can build a little bit of a relationship before you ask about any open positions. Then you'll have a leg up on other applicants because your name will be familiar. . . Try looking though the the CV's and websites of your department's faculty and see if any of their research stands out to you. Then shoot them an email introducing yourself and asking if they'd be willing to speak with you a little more about that project(s).

There has always been room, but after 10:00 it does fill in quite a bit, so you will probably have to park in the back of the lot. The bus that picks up most frequently from there is Commuter North (idk if they have changed routes with covid, but assuming things will be more normal in fall this is the bus you should plan on taking). It comes every 10 minutes and takes about 10-15 minutes to get to the CCTC. . . Around 10:00am the bus gets super crowded (again, in a normal year, idk exactly what fall will be like) and it takes longer to get to your destination with all the students going to class. That said, the orange lots are the first stop, so it's impossible to know how crowded it will become when you get on. This stop is the turnaround point for commuter north and south, so that means when you want to get back to the lot you take Commuter South. Commuter South get pretty busy from 4:30-5:00 and takes about 20-25 minutes to get back to the orange lots during those times. . . All that said, if the covid situation is still bad come fall, expect less frequent busses down there with fewer people. It is kind of hard to say anything for sure.. .

If you can't/don't want to buy a parking pass you can just park at Pioneer high school. There are a couple city buses that go to that stop, or you can just walk over to the stadium bus stop (5-10 minute walk).. . Two things to consider: the buses on the stadium route only run on weekdays, so if you want to get somewhere on a weekend you'll need to figure out other transportation. This is not a big deal at all, because a lot of the blue parking lots are free on weekends so odds are you can just drive wherever you need to be on campus. More importantly, you can't park by the stadium on days when there are home football or basketball games. Football games are on Saturdays so this mostly means you have to be out of the lot by 10pm on Friday night. Basketball games are more annoying because they happen on weekday evenings, and you normally have to be out of the lot by 5pm(?) or you'll get ticketed.

At least for this past year and as far as I'm aware it'll be there next year too, you can choose to join Theatre Club as part of your commitments in the MLC. (Everyone has to join a club, there's also Film and Creative Writing, both sound up your alley too.) There's also plenty of people in the community with the same interests you've listed and if you don't make joining a club about those things work out, you'll still have opportunities to express yourself creatively that way. . 2. It's not too large a commitment at all, at least not in my opinion. You have to join a low-intensity club that meets once a week, attend once monthly-ish All-Community Meetings, and you're free to participate in other different community events at your discretion. You also have to take a LSWA class each semester, that might be the biggest real commitment with LSWA, but one of them is your First Year Writing Requirement that you'd have to take anyways so it balances out. . 3.

Go through your Major (AND A BACKUP MAJOR.) immediately. **Immediately.** Figure out exactly what classes you need to pass in order to get your degree. The easiest way to do this is to use the Audit tool (if you're in LSA I think). I have been screwed over (by myself I guess) for not going through this with a fine enough level of detail to the point that I was once 2 semesters early to graduate, and now I'm 2 behind.. 2. After you know \*exactly\* what classes you \_need\_ to graduate/progress through your major, try to take every single one of them that you can at WCC or other community colleges. Especially Math. Math here sucks (unless you're majoring in Math). If you're a CS/DS student, take every single Math/Stats/203 class you can get to transfer if you can. The upper levels (400+) are wayyyy better classes, actually teach you better, and feel like they're worth it in regards to the material and are way less weeder-y classes. Take the upper levels or important classes (EECS kids: 280, 281) here. Take anything else that will be a waste of time if you can afford to at community college.. 3. Start early on \*everything\* and pre-plan everything. One important tip is if you have classes that give you grades at a reasonable time and lay out their grading policy in the rubric, spreadsheet out your grades ahead of time if they haven't done it for you already in Canvas, so come finals time you know where you can flunk it and where you need to focus if you want to pass.. 4. Talk to your classmates, GroupMe, Discord, whatever. If you're transferring in, AA has it's quirks, you'll only really learn em if you talk to people. . . .

In addition, me benefitting from military protection doesn't stop another person from receiving the same protection. . . Public goods would not exist without the government providing them because there is no incentive to pay for a good that you can't be stopped from using.

Now, I have no idea why you're wondering about drug testing. It could be purely administrative, relate to the use of legal things such as marijuana, or perhaps more serious substances (although I'd certainly hope not).

They are very helpful for the course. Since they have taken the course in the past 1-2 years, they have an idea of how the class progresses and what helped them get a good grade in the class (usually in the A range); in addition, most of the IAs have previous tutoring/teaching experience so they have an idea of how to help people learn already. Most importantly though, IAs are in charge of Sunday Reviews, which are one and a half hour sessions which review the previous week's content while also showing problems done in real time. Attending those helps to reinforce the concepts while also aiding in the upcoming week's homework.. . Overall, I would say that the ChE department's teaching staff for courses is very well done.

The big difference between umich and MSU with getting into the BSN program is that there aren't 100s-1000s of prenursing students at umich like there are at MSU. Most of the students at u of m who decide to transfer into the nursing school do so because they changed their mind about their major, which inherently makes it less competitive than the small number of 50 students sounds like. There are also plenty of transfer students from other universities who apply (and probably 50+% of my transfer cohort were from different universities), so it tends to be a little bit different than thousands of prenursing students already in the university competing for limited spots. . . I do have friends who changed their majors or didn't get into the nursing program on their first application cycle and will be in college for longer than 4 years, but in the grand scheme of things an extra year or two means almost nothing.

It is **mandatory** that you finish the pre-requisites before starting classes at U of M, BUT you do not need to have the classes completed when you apply, you just need to demonstrate that **you have a plan to complete all the pre-requisite classes.** Most people submit their applications in the fall/winter for the next fall term - if you do this and want to take some of the pre-requisite classes over the summer (after you've already submitted your application) that's fine, just make it clear on the application that you plan on doing that.. . The transfer advising office can answer specific questions about course equivalencies and help you navigate submitting courses for equivalency. Their phone number is (734) 647-7101 and their hours are 2:30 - 4:30 pm EDT Monday - Friday. They were super helpful when I transferred a couple years ago.. . Don't worry about anything else.

I was interested in the wider breadth of computational biology coursework offered at Stanford, as well as exploring potential opportunities in the private sector/entrepreneurship.. 2. I did apply to Stanford partly because I had done some things in the year prior that gave me a shot at getting there. I took your basic CS freshman courseload (even though I was planning to major in BME haha) which included EECS 203, 280, 281, as well as Chem 210/11, Chem 215/16 HH. Be advised, imo the classes you take don't really matter as much as why you want to transfer and things you do outside of courses if you are considering transferring.. 3. I admit I am biased here since I transferred out, but in my view Stanford is quite a step above UMich in terms of prestige, especially in CS. Many people in this thread I would say are right in that most of the schools ranked higher than UMich are very similar, but I would argue that a very small handful are a step above. UMich is a fine school, but they have 1 Nobel laureate and Stanford has 20. I did not know about these until I came to Stanford, but there are many opportunities, fellowships, internships, and competitions only made available to Stanford-tier schools, especially in tech and finance. Won't lie, the core classes are practically the same as UMich in terms of difficulty and curricula, so this shouldn't be a driving factor in a decision to transfer. The key differences are the network of crazy people (awesome cofounders if you are interested in startups) and the advantages of being in the bay area. For me personally, Stanford was less w/ fin aid (I was on in-state tuition at UMich too). For me, the expanded opportunities was what made it most worth the switch.. . Overall, the things that surprised me the most about the transition was 1) just how big entrepreneurial/startup culture at Stanford was, and 2) how much of an impact nice-weather year-round can have on mental well-being and happiness. Be warned, Stanford gives off a very different vibe than UMich and a lot of other large, public schools.. . One last bit of advice, please don't value yourself based on whichever school you are at. I heavily encourage making the most of wherever you are. I had an awesome time my first year at UMich, and still have very fond memories.

They're lots of fun, and it's great to make new friends with people you live next to.. . But it's not that crazy to commute 20 minutes, and you might be better off putting that money elsewhere. Here's what should be understood if they're going to do that.. . 1. Make friends in classes, and try to join a club asap. Greek life is a great way to make friends and it gives a good place for housing if they want to move out in later years. Greek life gets and understandably bad rep, but there are still some frats and sororities filled with good people if you find the right one. If you or they're not into that, there a ton of clubs and professional fraternities that are great resource as well. If they join marching band for example a lot of them live in houses with fellow members as upper classmen.. . 2. If they make friends, I'm sure someone will have a couch they can crash on if they want to stay. I knew a few people that commuted and never felt left out if they wanted to do things.. . 3. I'd say that as a parent you should probably be prepared to be flexible with they're schedule. Lots of late nights either studying or hanging out with people. My time at UMich was pretty hectic and I know a lot of people that felt the same way.. . 4. Parking is tough, but there's a couple options. If they can get an orange pass, that'll put them within about 10-15 walking distance from anywhere on campus. Central campus is hard to find parking without a pass, but I'd recommend going south of campus and trying to find parking down there. Usually about a 20 min walk to campus from spots down there. For North campus, theres a parking lot attached to Northwood apartments about a 5 north of GG brown, which is right on North Campus. I parked there for about 2 years without a pass and got ticketed only about 5 times, and the tickets are $20 a piece. Considering a parking pass is about $180 a year or so, I consider that a damn good deal. Just tell them not to park there on career fair days.. . 5. There's a good chance that if they are in freshman dorms they'd be on a North campus dorm anyways, which for freshman isnt great. Most early classes for engineering will be on Central Campus, and so will most club meetings and social activities. North campus dorms are about a 10-15 min bus ride from central.. .

I'll be back to commuting this coming fall though. . . It's definitely doable, and I'd hardly say it's setting them up for failure. The biggest issue is just finding parking and the extra time it takes to drive in and get there on time. City lots are expensive and it can be difficult to get a UM parking pass for university lots. Generally I'll park in one of the neighborhoods around North Campus, or one of the Park and Ride lots and bus into campus. School IDs work as a city bus pass so it's ""free"" to bus in. I live about 30 mins south of AA, but I generally leave about an hour and a half to two hours before my first class to make sure I have time to get there (which is maybe a little excessive, but it allows for bad traffic, missed busses, etc.). This is especially annoying if there are any really early classes.. . The student life aspect definitely suffers, but I still made plenty of friends and found time to go out. However, I don't think my grades particularly suffered. I couldn't really afford to live in the dorms and was unwilling to take out more loans, and ultimately I think commuting is the best option for me. . . That said, the short time I lived in AA was definitely nice, not commuting easily meant an extra hour+ of sleep and much easier access to friends and activities.

It is silly to waste all that money just to live 20 minutes from home. For many students it is also better from a mental health perspective. My freshmen year was a struggle, but getting to come home every night to a supportive family was what kept me going.. . It is admittedly harder in some aspects to commute. Busses and parking can be a challenge until the student gains enough credits to get a parking pass from the University. Additionally, it is harder to participate is a large amount of extra curriculars, but even with those added challenges, I was able to hold two jobs and a research position my freshman year while commuting 30 minutes of driving+15 minutes of a bus ride to Ann Arbor everyday. . .

I see the benefits in making friends and joining clubs on campus, but ultimately I'm there to get my degree and get out of there. That is why commuting works so well for me, but a more social person with less concern for the cost of their college can certainly get their preferred experience living on campus. No shade to that person, everyone has their own plans. That's why there's so many different options people can take at college.

I would say that doing it without an extra year is doable, but you'll absolutely need to use spring/summer semesters to some extent. First off, I'm going to make an assumption that you don't have any prior internship experience in CS.. . Here's a tentative breakdown of how your schedule might look w/o the spring/summer semester.. . . . Essentially, your junior year will be bottle necked by EECS 183, EECS 203, and EECS 280, which you absolutely have to take this year.. . . . Then your senior fall semester will be bottle necked by EECS 281, which you can take in tandem with EECS 370 and EECS 376, but I do not recommend this at all if you want any semblance of social life/want a somewhat decent time trying to get an internship. . . The senior winter semester, you'll need to take at least 2 upper level EECS, and the following semester (super senior fall semester) you'll need to take 2 upper level EECS and the capstone.. . So with this schedule, you can theoretically complete it with just one extra semester.. . If there's any room to take a class over the spring/summer semester, I'd say it'd have to be during your junior year. You can take EECS 281 over the spring semester and some other EECS class over the summer semester (maybe an upper level EECS, maybe 370).. . That way, you can take 2 upper level EECS + EECS 376 in your fall senior semester and 2 upper level EECS + your capstone in your winter senior semester.. . . . However, there're several huge issues with this schedule. The first is that in trying to finish in an accelerated time frame, you're pretty much screwed on internships. Without completing EECS 281, you'll find it pretty difficult to either get an interview or succeed in an interview (which pretty much locks you out of getting an internship your junior year). Even assuming you get an internship, you might find it really difficult to take classes while doing your internship. You also might have to operate on the constraint that your internship will need to be in Ann Arbor to allow you to take classes at the same time (assuming they require in person).. . Then going into your senior year, you'll need to spend time trying to find a job while only having a single internship that, reasonably speaking, isn't going to be all that impressive (this also assumes you managed to get one in the first place).. . . . The second issue is that your senior year is going to be incredibly packed, and this creates two issues in itself. The first issue is that you're pretty much blocked from taking incredibly difficult but rewarding classes like EECS 482 (good luck taking that with another upper level EECS and EECS 376/a different upper level EECS). And the second issue is that you're going to be so busy in your senior year that finding a job will be realllllllllly difficult. You'll need to invest a lot of time into your search given that you likely won't have an internship under your belt from junior year, and balancing all that is... really difficult if not nigh impossible.. . So to summarize, *is it possible to finish your CS degree in just 2 more years*? Definitely, it's possible, but I would heavily advise you seek at least one extra semester in your journey. Having the possibility of getting an internship in your senior year summer is incredibly valuable towards obtaining a job, since I imagine whatever internship you manage to obtain in your junior summer won't be too amazing. Additionally, having that extra semester allows you to spend more time on searching for both internships and a job, which is far more important than graduating quickly imo. The degree's great and all, but it'd be far more advantageous to have a job lined up after graduation than to graduate without one.",7.0,error,0.0

UMich is the largest public university for research, so this means two things. The first thing is that it should be fairly straightforward to get a research position. The second is that if you apply to a grad school, it's probable they'll want to see that you have research experience of some kind. . . For grad school you'll need some recc letters and a statement of purpose, so it really is in your best interest to get a research position, since a recc letter can easily come from the professor you work with, and having a research position related to your field of interest will do wonders for your statement of purpose.. . The advantages of pursuing research over an internship means that you could attempt to snag a research position either over the summer while you're doing classes, or just in the regular semester, which should be a lot more manageable than trying to get an internship. . . Regarding grad school options, if you talk to an advisor, they'll likely recommend [SUGS](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate-programs/prospective-grad-students/graduate-school-for-u-m-ug-students/sugs/), so keep this in your back pocket. If you want to go for SUGS though, it's imperative you remain in decently good academic standing (whatever minimums they specify). . . This is particularly important because if you do a schedule of what I stated before of EECS 281, EECS 370, and EECS 376 in a single semester, there's a decent chance you won't be able to make that minimum (I did that schedule personally, and unless you're incredibly studious with your time and use every resource available to you, there's a decent chance you'll fail at least one class let alone getting the bare minimum to remain in standing for SUGS).. . So in summary, if your goal is grad school, internships certainly aren't a *priority*.

That doesn't mean that everyone is a Jordan Belfort studying-calc-while-snorting-cocaine-and-listening-to-EDM type, but it does mean that there's a super strong sense of school pride and a super vibrant extracurricular presence at the school. The student body (on balance) is not super egghead-y nor is super over the top with activism on either end of the political spectrum, but most people are involved in a variety of clubs and organizations. What you basically get is a lot of really intelligent, social, and down to earth people. Everyone is just cool, smart, and chill. . . In terms of sports, while there are obviously some people who aren't huge fans, you won't find very many and those who do still seem to enjoy the game day experience regardless. A large of part of that comes from the school's Greek Life presence which, while large, is not overwhelming. I believe 18-20% of the student body is affiliated with either a frat or sorority. I'm not sure if that number includes off-campus frats, which are a significant portion now. Either way, game days are accompanied by all-morning tail gates thrown by said frats and with upwards of 100,000 people descending on Ann Arbor to watch, it becomes quite the scene. Think of your classic all-american college movie banger. It's like that.. . On that note, parties in general are not hard to find, and once again, frats run a lot of those. If you're a girl, you can just show up anywhere and get in. If you're a guy, you probably need to pledge a frat to experience it. Kind of a tough situation ngl. Most clubs also have a big social element too though, especially teams. The sailing team, rugby team, and club tennis (to name a few) will **all** be throwing awesome parties throughout the semester.. . If any of this doesn't appeal to you-- don't worry. The school has 45,000 students and you *will* find your niche. That's the beauty of it. There are hundreds of people just like you and it's not hard to know where to look to find them. On balance, though, this is the vibe of the school. Hopefully this all helps you a little bit, and if you have any more questions, feel free to message me!",3.0,error,0.0

So I'm currently doing SUGS in 4 like you are looking at and entering my junior year (so last year of undergrad), so I can try and help.. . **TLDR: Yes it is possible. It's 16 credits per semester which is average for the CoE. Just make sure to think about what you want out of college. Also talk to an advisor. They are paid for things like this and are much more reliable than reddit.**. . **Long Answer (My disjointed ramble):**. . So the first question is what credits are you coming in with? Is it random humanities or calc I + II, Physics I + II and say intro CS course. Because then you can start with your major classes: Circuits, thermodynamics, etc. That comes with the downside of doing classes meant for people who have the hang of Michigan as a freshman... and freshman year is chaos.. . If not though, then you have to take classes over the summer at community college. It's a fantastic option and its what I did (Calc III, Physics II and Econ 101) at cc after my freshman year. But know that you're going to have to do it.. . But besides the numbers ask if you're ok doing some heavy semesters (16-18 credits). With the credits you have you could do 12-14 credit semesters all the way through and graduate on time. This gives times to get really involved in a design team, join greek life, do a co-op (which a lot of people due since they graduate in 7 semesters. There will be a lot of moments where you are stuck in the library doing hw when your friends are drinking in the dorm room. Luckily for you, BME it is 3.2 GPA (rip MechE at 3.6) but for all the reasons above it can be hard to have a reasonable ~~consumption of alcohol~~ healthy social life and also graduate in 3.. . With that all said I love that I will get a masters, I love that I get to take really cool electives quickly and as an out of state kid I'm saving a lot of money by doing my degree in 4 instead of 5. Plus I am happy with my social sphere. Cheers hope this is some use",21.0,positive,0.9451606273651123

I've also taken many of the courses you asked about recently. Others have answered extensively about honors math and P/F so I will deal with the other things. . . 1, Assuming that you are not trying to graduate early, your schedule should have no issue handling a minor. I am getting a linguistics minor so almost no credits that will double count, yet it doesn't put much pressure on my freedom with other selections. French minor is a bit more work but you shouldn't let that concern you. . . 2, Personally I took linalg befire Calc III. This is uncommon but I feel my linalg knowledge is somewhat useful in Calc III. People take those three math in all kinds or orders so getting a good prof is probably more important. Cannot really speak to diffeq. . 3, I say definitely skip 140 because I had a terrible time in that class and it being online didn't help. It didn't teach me much physics at all and was unreasonably difficult. That course is a big part of me abandoning ME. 240 with Winn, on the other hand, is the best physics I've ever taken. (YMMV) . . 4, I took section ENGR 100-320: practical data science for engineers and I loved it. This is the class that convinced me to switch to data science. A bit of coding experience goes a long way in this class; it's offered in winter so taking 101 in fall works nicely. Three friends took section 960 and it is about weather / meteorology. They rated it only alright. I've heard generally positive things about the aerospace sections. . . Hope this helps. Feel free to PM me for more details.",2.0,positive,0.6628642082214355

I took diff eq before calc 3, and personally, I don't recommend it. This is more in regards to how the classes are structured rather than the subject material. Labs in calc 3 assume that students don't have any experience using Matlab, and are much more straightforward (there's a lot of copying and pasting rather than actually writing code). While it's not required to take calc 3 before diff eq, I think from how the labs in diff eq are set up implies that you were supposed to take calc 3 first. The labs in diff eq assume that you already have experience using Matlab and are extremely confusing (though this could vary depending on your GSI). I also thought that the exams in diff eq were much harder than in calc 3. If you already have experience with Matlab or are a quick learner, then I think you'll be fine with taking diff eq before calc 3 if you really wanted to. However, I highly recommend taking calc 3 before diff eq.. . For ENGR 100, I took the solar energy section, which I think is only offered in the winter.

But I think there's more to that question than just what classes you take--because these classes, and combinations of classes, are meant to add up to something like a world view. . . Both COE and LSA are great, and both degrees will get you jobs. COE's curriculum is meant to get you to think about and see the world as an engineer sees it. LSA's curriculum is built to get you to see and think from a liberal arts and sciences perspective. Either is valid, but I'd argue that at the undergraduate level, the liberal arts approach gives you more breadth and flexibility in how you engage with the world, and how you solve problems. . . A liberal arts approach helps you bring history, psychology, philosophy, politics, etc. into your purview, as well as habits of mind that ask you to see problems from other people's perspectives and to look for complicating factors that you might miss the first time around. Certainly that can happen through an engineering curriculum too, but it's the \*point\* of the liberal arts--to get a deeper, richer understanding of the human factors involved in the world and your work. Having that broad perspective will prepare you not just for a world that is changing super fast, and help you get not only your first job out of school but your fourth, or fourteenth. That's why a lot of tech firms are specifically looking for liberal arts grads.. .

Note that the IRS allows you to exempt up to $250,000 ($500,000 for married filing jointly) in capital gains income (difference between cost basis and sale price) on the sale of a primary residence. This income won't show up on your Form 1040, and therefore won't be imported with the IRS Data Retrieval tool (or isn't in the box you copy over, if you manually fill it in). So unless you're selling a house you've either had for a very long time or you have a very expensive house, you should be fine.. .

Adding on: you asked about how it'll change the assets portion. Really the income change would be the bigger factor here. The assets part shouldn't make a negligible change. I imagine your parents don't plan on simply keeping the money in a checking account (although I suppose I don't know your parents' lives) so different types of assets count differently. For example, if they saved for retirement, FAFSA would then not count any of that. Additionally, they may not be (in fact, are likely not) planning to keep the equity. Often folks just put all the money in their new mortgage as a down payment plus, so your liquid assets would change in exactly no material way. Maybe they might take some money but I doubt they'd take out all the equity without some plan on what they're going to do with it, even when they do downsize. . .
