I also did the minor in business and while your 17 credit workload isn't awful considering you're not going to have many extracurricular/social commitments, it's not crucial to take Econ 101 first semester as it is a co-requisite for the minor in business, not a prerequisite... meaning you have to take it at some point before you graduate with the minor not necessarily before. Go ahead and knock out an easier intellectual breadth/general elective and take Econ when you have a lighter semester down the road.

Don't let a dickhead like me ruin your new experience with reddit (even tho reddit can be very hostile at times, hence my hostile reactions. Fake accts run rampant in reddit, mostly to spread misinformation and to antagonize left-wing users, since apparently right-wing people want to see others suffer ('make liberals cry again' being one of many terms.) hence my distain and utter lack of room for debate, because with most of those I've met from that side of out political space, you cannot reason with them or debate with them. Science, history and facts are matters of opinion to them, and it's a waste of time to try...and god knows i have tried.). . But honestly, i hope your patriotic sentiment does stand firm. Because it will be tested, many many times. . . Our nation needs some socialism in it, otherwise we will fall to corrupt entities, and the people will be cheering on as it does. Many of the nations that you talked about fell due to human greed. Communism is impossible to implement unless the people running are basically robotic in their sentimentality. Marxism is what i explained. . . All forms of government bear corruption, it isn't that uncommon. And it certainly isn't just The Iron Curtain or the Nazis that have committed atrocities. The Americans slaughtered the indigenous people and stole their land. Hitler was inspired by manifest destiny, a belief that it was gods will for the Americans to massacre and conquer lands to expand westward. The British were imperialists that ruled half of the world with an iron fist, especially in Apartheid South Africa and the British Raj in India. Yes, those countries in the Iron Curtain have faced atrocities by people claiming to follow the ideology of Marx (Stalin (who was a total fucking nutcase) Lenin, Mao, Pol Pot (also a nutcase), the hot mess Venezuela is in currently and idk what Castro did though..), but lets not forget what atrocities made the First World into what we see today.. . Capitalism has been seen, time and time again, to usurp democracy, if given the opportunity to do so. You see lobbyists everywhere for various organizations. Hell Trump put various shady corporate officials into various political offices. Betsy DeVos is married to the CEO of Amway, her brother founded Blackwater, a private paramilitary organization. Trump himself founded various businesses and they all went under, and he was known to screw over most who did business with him. . . The point of my post and this subsequent post is that me attacking the US is both because it isn't the greatest in the nation, that its hypocritical to say anything other than capitalism is unAmerican thus not giving room for other ideologies to flourish, and that the current administration and its officials are products of capitalism, and has proved themselves time and time again to not be for the people, but rather for themselves. . . We shouldn't hold capitalism to such a high regard, as its been shown time and time again that, without regulation and restriction, it will fuck us over. . . And it may not have worked out for your home country the way it has here. But the reason why it worked out here and why we made so many great things and did so many great things is because of the people striding to benefit mankind.

Each day we go to lab we have to go to a screening station to answer a symptom/travel questionnaire (can be done verbally or online), we get a temperature check, and we get a sticker with the screening location and date on it confirming that we are good to go. Masks are required, but you can take them off if you are in a room where you can reasonably expect someone won't come in. There are signs outside of bathrooms and every lab showing the maximum number of people allowed in there at once, and in big open labs, people are supposed to put painter's tape on the floor to designate someone's bench space so that other lab members stay at least 6ft away at all times. Every room also has a log posted on the door where lab members are supposed to record when they sanitized door handles, light switches, commonly used equipment, etc. Apparently these logs may be collected by occupational health to confirm that people are sanitizing frequently enough. Labs have also been required to start working in shifts (6am-2pm, 3pm-11pm) in order to reduce capacity, and have had to submit these shiftwork plans to the university.. . There are some issues, though. I have never seen occupational health checking that the rules are being followed, though I have heard that they are occasionally coming through. The other issue is that no one has access to regular testing, so people with covid but are asymptomatic may be coming to lab. If we report symptoms on the daily screening questionnaire, I believe the lab head receives an email letting them know that the employee is not allowed in the lab until they have been confirmed not to have covid. The employee can then go to occupational health to get tested. Because many of us weren't able to do research for several months, we're anxious to collect data and we're often being pressured.

The first thing we should do is look at the data...with all the new housing being built in the last decade, what's been the impact? Housing costs are still going up. New housing costs more than old housing in the same area. Building another tall building on that lot brings in more rich people than the city can currently hold. More rich people means more demand for goods and services, increasing the price of all those goods and services. . . Most importantly, the crisis we both care about was NOT caused by lack of housing. It was caused by discriminatory policies targeting minorities. The solution should address this specific issue. We should be giving better loans and incentives (tax breaks) to the very same groups of people being targeted. This allows them to afford the housing that they currently can not afford. This results in a more diverse and inclusive city. If the new downtown development goes as you were hoping, the percentage of privileged people might actually go up. Also, giving someone a discount on housing is countered by the increased cost of living they will see by living downtown. I don't pump gas, but clothes, or rely on service providers downtown because they charge more. . . No, blindly building more housing is not working, it won't work if we do it again, it doesn't address the major injustices of the past, and is actually just making the rich richer. You need to expand the way you think about this problem and get more creative with the solution. . . I'm actually in favor of African Americans not paying any property tax or income tax for 450 years to make up for the years of slavery and continued injustice. THAT is a way to help them afford housing, build generational wealth, and increase their representation. Letting XX black families live downtown in a building with XXX units for rich families is certainly going to make things worse.

Low-income people that are low-income because of systematic racism should be helped. If you're just poor and not poor because of racist policies then you should find other ways around your situation. For example, I grew up in a single mom household. She was 20, in college, cleaning houses, working at Dillard's (store similar to Macy's) and raising me (one year old at the time). After college she got a physical therapy degree, commuted to the other side of town for work, saved up, opened her own clinic, saved money, bought a house in a better neighborhood, bought more properties and rented them out, and became a self made millionaire. She is an Iranian-American. She was not at a disadvantage due to her race being systematically targeted by lenders and policy makers. Therefore, I would never support some sort of policy to help her out because she already was in a position to help herself and started froM a clean slate.

This would be a solution addressing the source of the issue...more houses seems to be what fake ""woke"" white people want but are scared to admit is not really the solution society needs and is meant to benefit white people that are low income instead of focusing all the help on the African Americans who's ancestors were slaves, grandparents couldn't get loans, and experience racism with every interaction with the American economy and housing market.

That would mean that if you keep checking the LSA course guide, you could catch the day when the next 6 seats are opened for the seminar you are interested in and beat out students with later academic advising dates. That being said, if you're gunning for a more popular class, there are probably several other students also trying to snatch up those seats as soon as they are available, so it might be tough. (I'm trying to find my way into one myself... The last time that seats were freed from enrollment management for the seminar I want to get into, I noticed less than 24 hours after the seats were opened but all 6 had already been claimed by other students.). . For reference, the last time most/all of the seminars had new seats opened was two or three weeks ago, so I'm going to guess that means that the last 6 seats for these classes will be opened this upcoming week or the week after (presumably on Monday, but I don't know that for sure... who knows how regular the seat opening schedule is).",2.0,neutral,0.8427010774612427

Also, if this is your first time with what I'll phrase as ""mental health medication,"" just be aware that sometimes it can take a few tries to find the right solution for you, because brain/body chemistry can be weird and there isn't always a perfect immediate solution for everyone.

That part can get disheartening or discouraging and I gave up for a while. . .

But combined with fatigue and me not being able to concentrate, I was even unable to put in those 15 hours, which made me go to UHS. They initially started me on depression medications, which helped with my fatigue. When my focus did not improve, they asked me to up the dosage, which still didn't help. I was referred to an internal psychiatrist, that was very very insistent that I have anxiety. When I did go on SSRI for 4 weeks, I started having physical anxiety symptoms that I never did before, which is how I knew it wasn't that. I was asked questions and also referred to as desperate (which I was, I was frustrated), because I cannot have ADHD -- because I didn't show physical hyperactivity signs, I was a female, I did well academically (you are in a CS PhD program in UMich, you can't have learning issues). . . . I was finally fed up, and just went and found a provider that takes new patients, and accepts BCN and provides ADHD testing -- and they did a 2 hour call, and prescribed small dosage of stimulant.

First off, let me back up: I disagree with those who claim that UM could easily be 100% online. I think there are strong arguments that certain classes should be taught in person if it all possible. Some studio, lab, fabrication, performance, design, and clinical courses are challenging to do online. Even Cal State, who famously was one of the first major university systems to say they were going ""all remote,"" are planning to teach courses like this in person.. . Teaching these classes is not some kind of money grab. There are legitimate reasons to try to teach these face-to-face is possible and for as long as conditions allow.. . The problem, however, could be that this may not be where U Of M is drawing the line. I think that in addition to courses which MUST be done in person, it may also offer others that way, too. . . Why? Maybe to appease a certain segment of faculty, and a certain segment of students, who are digging their heels in about hating online. Maybe to help new students have some chance at enjoying an experience more like the one they were expecting when they applied. Maybe to increase the chances that students who really want at least one face-to-face course experience can have one, even if they're not in a major with lab or design or clinical courses. And yes, to make the UM experience distinctive from the one you would have if you just sit out a year and take online classes at your local community college (this is where the revenue preservation cynicism seems strongest). And of course, up until last week, to keep international students from being unceremoniously deported. Don't forget that was a legit risk until DHS backed down.. .

Definition: The **scientific method** is an [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical) method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, applying rigorous [skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism) about what is observed, given that [cognitive assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science#Observation_inseparable_from_theory) can distort how one interprets the [observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception#Process_and_terminology). It involves formulating [hypotheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis), via [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning), based on such observations; [experimental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) and measurement-based testing of [deductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are *principles* of the scientific method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#cite_note-3). . There are experiments in Economics. To answer your question, both Economics and Physics utilize the scientific model, which relies on observations, model building, and applying the model to reality. The reason why you think Physics are more rigorous is that in physics you are much more able to create controlled environment, while in human sciences in general it's much more difficult and a lot of assumptions needs to be made(perhaps the reason is considered less rigorous).. . However, keep in mind that, markets, economies and societies are often much more complex than physical system(when it comes to analysis), do you know hod difficult is to create a model that predicts things like the COVID-19 and its implications in the economy? Also economics is a field that is much newer than physics, so considable advancements in the field are expected in the near future. Maths used in physics and economics are actually almost identical. Modern economics is founded on neo-Keynesianism, and its father was Keynes, a mathematician.. . At my university, every week there were many experiments with individuals and their way of making decisions in more or less controlled environments. Even I participated in a few to check theories of the research department.. . The only difference between economics and the natural sciences is that in economics the variables are human beings and in the natural sciences they are natural elements, beyond that, both use the scientific method and mathematics / statistics as a fundamental tool and basis to expose many theories and then corroborate their effectiveness based on experiments. . .

So they bought out some sophomores (and maybe upperclassmen too) who were planning to live on campus.

Take this year for example. If the university was prioritizing the health of the university, it would dip into its endowment to invest in contact tracing and testing, even if it hurts the health of the endowment. I don't think that the managers are getting most of the endowment money, my issue is with the culture that surrounds this endowment. Even though I'm pretty capitalist, I dislike the fact that we have $12B just sitting there being treated as a mutual fund. Sure, the managers are helping us increase this money, but at some point you have to take a step back from looking at the ROI and actually invest these profits back into the school. If that means our endowment shrinks to 11B, while or even 10B, while bad for the endowment, would help the school overall, which is my point.

It also wasn't so much a bold new plan as making some new operational decisions.

The blind corner is a problem. Too easy to sneak a candy bar in your pocket when nobody's watching.. . * Keeping lower inventory stock levels. Less stuff can disappear (and it's more noticeable) when there's less stuff in total. Makes ordering harder but tracking is much easier.. . * Locking the door at night. Makes the store ""business hours only"" for anyone without a BBB key. Personally I don't like the idea of restricting who can go in like this, but we were planning to try it for a while to see how it goes. Another discussed option was to install an MCard reader on the door, but this turns out to be prohibitively expensive (among other issues).. . * Ask people directly to pay their debt while in the store. A huge amount of loss is simply people going into debt and never paying Betty back.. . * We incurred significant loss whenever our POS terminal went down, because people would simply take merchandise with the intention of paying back next time but forget. Our internal tracking and other metrics suggest this happened *a lot*. We made some improvements to the software to reduce the frequency this happened.. . * High-theft items disproportionately included expensive non-candy, non-beverages such as protein bars and soup.

Professors change frequently and its not easy to guarantee which classes will be available in a given semester, and not too many of the classes are split for majors vs non-majors, so it's likely you'll be put on a waitlist as art majors get first dibs.

But I don't want to dismiss the value of in-person art classes, and if you have the ability to take cheaper weekly evening/weekend classes at an art college or something nearby, I'd recommend those. I just dont think that pursuing an art minor will be particularly worthwhile if you don't need the university credits for it too. (Also the studios are quite long and can be difficult to schedule with other classes, especially as you progress into CS classes that also only have limited sections or offerings, a number of Stamps classes have only a couple sections, if that. . edit: also from what I'm aware of, there arent really dedicated tracks within the art school. Even for art majors, you just pop out with a broad, open-ended BFA/BA by the end of it, without a specific concentration. This can be good if you want to experiment with different media, but not as great if you want to take a deep dive in a specific direction.

The GBG guarantees tuition, but many GBG students qualify for more and get it. And for lowest-income students, no loans in their packages either.. . The reason the GBG only GUARANTEES a certain amount (i.e. tuition) is there is a group of families who qualify at first glance but upon deeper analysis don't need the same kind of help that more families at that lower income do. Guaranteeing them a ""full ride"" would be overcommitting aid to them.. . ETA: Here's some more info. From the federal ""college scorecard"" site, the average cost for a family at the lowest income band (up to $30K): $3,962 That number is a lot less than room, board, books and incidentals. How? because UM gives MORE aid than just ""free tuition."". . If you want to dive deeper, look at Bridge Magazine's article: https://www.bridgemi.com/talent-education/ignore-sticker-price-michigan-universities-heres-real-cost. Here is a quote:. . *The state university with the highest sticker price is also the cheapest for the majority of Michigan families. The net cost on the Ann Arbor campus is the lowest among the state's public universities for families earning less than $30,000 per year, families earning between $30,000 and $48,000, and middle-class families earning between $48,000 and $75,000.*. .

I even made a reddit post a week ago talking about the EXACT same point you're bringing up.. . As others have said, and what I have been trying to tell myself, you will *not* miss out on much. I mean, just think about it, try to thing of the most stereotypical ""college experience"" things. Want to work out? The gyms are closed and/or at half capacity. Want to get a job? All on-campus opportunities are almost completely slashed, and if you think *you're* going to be the one to get that job at the restaurant over a non-student out of work for months, it's a fat chance. Want to go to a football game, and party after? Nope. Want to socialize at the dining hall and eat as much as you want? Nuh-uh. Studying at the library? Good luck getting in at half-capacity, as I'm sure all the depressed, dorm-ridden students are going to be flocking to the building to feel like they're in a different environment. Clubs, extracurriculars, dorm parties, frat parties, even letting someone in your *room*, it's all going to be either completely underground or not at all.. . And that's the thing. It's truly a lose-lose situation being on campus if you are going to actively try to get that ""college experience"". You can either A) drop all that money on a dorm, obey social-distancing protocols, and likely be semi-miserable as disappointment grows exponentially, or B) disobey protocols in an effort to chase that feeling, ultimately contributing to the cause that ends up sending everyone home. In essence, you either pay to be sad in a dorm or you try to have fun and end up sending everyone home anyways.. . That's no bueno. As for my situation, I'll be saving $10k in loans, I have a job lined up back home, I just bought a car, I got good friends there, and I'll have the ability to chase my hobbies and travel with my bros, as you can do online classes anywhere.. .

If you look at some of the upper level CS courses, some of them require math 214/215/216. Plus, CS is largely based on math and the better you are at it the better you will be at developing algorithms. . . \-I think this is definitely doable. 203 is a pain though. Nobody has anything good to say about it ever and it's not an easy course in the slightest. 183 was my first exposure ever to CS and after I got the hang of it, it was mostly just busy work. Lots of opportunity for extra credit, just start projects early and don't underestimate the exams. Incredibly common to get 100=< + on exams/homework, and then 40%> on exams. . . \-As for AP credits, I ended up dropping all of mine. They counted towards nothing and ended up just getting me closer to the tuition increase once you hit 55 credits faster. As far as a semester or year early, its really up to you. A semester can be annoying because it's hard to find 4-6 month leases. Also, don't rush through college; its more than just the classes. Make sure you give yourself time to do research/clubs/sports and everything else that makes Michigan worth going to. . . \-CS alone is a great major, so adding on Econ really only matters if you want to go the more fintech route or leave the door open for something in Econ. Ross is pretty hard to get into for cross-campus transfer for minors in lsa (<20% if I had to guess but I could be totally off, obviously don't let that discourage you though). Whatever you do though, whether it be one two or three majors, just make sure you enjoy them first before pursuing them.. . \-This just depends if you want your degree to say college of engineering on it or lsa. The degrees in terms of CS are identical, just the prerequisites are different. Your gpa may be slightly higher if you stay in lsa since the gen Eds are a bit easier to get better grades in, but if you want a more physics/chem based background in coe, go ahead and apply. . . \-I'd just go for the FYRW since I've heard they're not terrible but if you really feel like you need extra work on your writing and it'd help you in your future, then just go with 100. . . &#x200B;. .

I also think that enthusiasm for online classes had to have been dampened by who the early adopters and major players in online education have been--which have included for-profits, institutions with a mission of access, and institutions who saw online as a survival strategy. I know it's since broadened and we have many institutions, including peers, who offer more online stuff, but for a long time the major players weren't like UM and they were selling a kind of education that I don't think UM wanted to deliver.. . Finally, I think UM recognizes that doing online stuff *well* isn't necessarily cheaper. UM had to decide to make a pretty big institutional investment to start doing online course delivery well. That doesn't make sense for a one-off course here or there. But UM did take the plunge eventually; it started with MOOCs and certificates and then branched out.

t1_fz18uq8,2020-07-23 23:26:55,t1_fz0ncml,t3_hb5n0f,"Of course! Disclaimer -- these are all my personal opinions lol. . . Preface: I came from an in-state public high school where a ton of kids went to Umich each year (like 50+). Going into freshman year, I severely underestimated umich's difficulty and also didn't really think of college as something I could use to my personal benefit, more as another hoop I was expected to jump through. In high school I took a lot of classes because everyone around me was taking them (ie. AP Physics, AP calc, etc). I'm including this because I think it's important to frame what mindset I had going into undergrad. . . So specific courses I took that I hated / disliked / could have considered to be a waste of time if I had had a different mindset:. . * **math 116:** Holy crap. I took this my first semester and through a mix of not being used to college teaching styles, arrogance, and overall distaste for math, I fell on my ass. I'd done pretty well on AP Calc in high school (got a 5 on AB and 4 on BC) but when it came to this course I really realized that I never wanted to do anything even remotely related to math. If I have to see another Taylor series problem ever again I will barf. . * This was valuable because up until this point I thought I wanted to transfer to engineering / do mathy stuff. It was a huge awakening to realize that I couldn't coast through class the way I did in high school and also helped me realize that in the past I had only tolerated math, not enjoyed it. This realization also meant I needed to look for a new major / path because I did not want to do purely quantitative things in a career. I was still interested in STEM, however. . * **Econ 101:** For some reason I was considering an econ major before I had ever taken a college level econ class. That was stupid. I also took this because my parents demanded I apply to Ross. That was also stupid. . * This was a burning fire pit for me. I had a friend in the same section who whizzed through all the assignments and I felt like I was peeling my fingernails off one by one. I hated the charts and was really bad at memorizing things. . * **Psych 240 (spring)**: This was the first and only spring class that I took during undergrad. I found the concepts very interesting, but it was very memorization based, which I did not at all find interesting. . * This course helped me realize I also did not like psychology. Lol. Again, AP Psych was a course I'd done well in during high school. But it was just another instance of ""JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE OKAY AT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD FOLLOW IT AS A CAREER PATH."". * **English 298:** SO I didn't hate this one. After the burning shit storm that was my first semester of college I started frantically going through every potential major in the book, including English, and 298 is required to declare an English major. I've always liked to read and write and wasn't really thinking about job security, just a major I was passionate about. This course was interesting but I didn't super enjoy writing analytical essays, and taking this helped me realize I am more of a creative writing person and not a ""read this old book and give me a rhetorical analysis of the author's usage of this literary device."". * It was because of this course that I began taking more creative writing classes and eventually led to me doing that as a minor. :). . And this actually extends even to my upperclassman years. I heard about the school of information right before my sophomore year, applied, and got into the program. SI allows you to pick pathways, and I originally thought I would do the Information Analysis (more data analysis ish) over the User Experience Design pathway. I had thought that combining my creative writing minor with a data analysis major would make be a good ""swiss army knife"" type candidate for jobs. Also, I had done well in the coding classes required for the program. . . But then I took a core class for that pathway (literally second semester junior year) and realized I didn't actually super like analyzing data sets at all. And what did being a Swiss Army Knife matter if you HATE A CORE ASPECT OF THE JOB? Lol. This same semester I had been taking a non-SI class on basically similar material to the UX pathway (it was kind of a studio class that made you do projects) and as I was drudging through the homework for the data analysis class I realized I was really enjoying the projects for the other class. . . Which leads me to where I am today -- happily graduated with a degree in UX design and a minor in Creative Writing. :). . Four years ago I had no idea what UX Design was. And I firmly believe it took me struggling through all of those other classes to get to this point where I am confident that I'm on the right track, because if I hadn't tried all of those other things, I might always be left wondering if there was something better out there. . .

Markley's bathrooms leave a bit to be desired, but they really aren't that bad. You get a little spot to put your stuff and they are defently clean.. . The rooms themselves are incredibly small, but you get used to it pretty quickly. And there are some ways you can arrange your stuff to maximize the space.. . It gets hot. If you have asthma or eczema or something like that, you might be able to get an AC for your room. But that comes at the cost of not being able to open your window. (The AC unit sits in the window and prevents it from being open).. . The walls in Markley are some of the thickest walls on campus, i found that not a lot of sound would go through them as compared to alice, east, squad, mojo, or literally any others.. . I think markley has some of the best social life on campus. Most people in my hall had a really solid friend group with people that they had met in college by the end of the first semester. (Idk how COVID will affect that). . The hideaway is pretty sweet. Access to bus stops is really convenient. Printing is kinda out of the way. The building is super fun to explore.. . The dining hall i think consistently had the best quality food, but just not the best variety. If there was any variety at all. It also closed earlier than other dining halls, i think.. . I found myself getting lazy near the end of each semester, walking to class would get annoying if ut was more than a 15 minute walk.. . I'd say 1/50 people will see a cockroach while living in Markley. Most people will see spiders (i had an all white spider in my room... scary). There are definitely other bugs that can make their way into your room if you leave your window open: stink bugs, flies, bees, etc.... . I think, freshman year, Markley is a great dorm to be in.

These people care deeply about Michigan students and will do all that they can do help guide your child. The second force at play is the beaurocracy that is UofM. This entity does not care about your child, it cares about money, first and foremost. This is also where the board of regents has power. . . I hope the individuals have enough sway to make sure the University stays safe, and I am sure that your child will find lots of support. However I would not be surprised if Michigan follows through with it's plans. . .

Just throw all that garbage out the window immediately because there's no world where this would not be the case. They'd never not do exactly this because it's the only logical thing anyone would ever do.. . . The only question to answer is, at what point do they stop with all the bullshit, if at all? There's about a 1% chance that everyone starts wearing masks, which is thee only thing that will end all of this. Students arrive from all over the country, and have all sorts of views, and many will refuse and many will continue to party and hang out, and without major major seriousness about the mask usage it will for sure spread throughout the university and they will shut down again.

I suppose we may have different philosophies on immigration. I contend that if there's no harm in admitting them, they should be allowed into the country. . . > Jobs. . You completely misread my point on jobs. Off-campus job opportunities are slim to none for most international students (literally none for first-year students), and if campus is closed, there are no on-campus jobs for them to compete for. It's not like they can just walk down to Meijer and ask to speak with the manager. . . >How so [are they pumping money into the economy]. . You don't see with your own eyes international students contributing to our economy? For starters they don't get any of the financial aid benefits that even OOS domestic students have, so at the very least there's a $60,000 check going to the University of Michigan. Plus money for dorms or rent. Then money for food, all of which goes into the local economy. And that's just the basics. If they're not working (see above), they're basically a long-term tourist. Tourism brings in money.. . >unemplyoment. . See above.. . >rental market. . Student housing isn't going to suddenly become affordable housing for those struggling to get by. Landlords will make more money between 1. enforcing their existing lease contracts to collect what they can from people who already signed leases, and 2. sitting tight until next year, when they can go back to charging the Ann Arbor housing prices we know and love. Plus we're talking about first-year students, who will likely be living on campus and don't have any impact on the broader Ann Arbor housing market. . . >ICE isn't taking a position on this. . Two things here.. . 1. Of course they are. If the executive branch didn't have flexibility, they wouldn't have walked back their position that students taking online coursework would have their active visas revoked. . . 2. Even if ICE/DHS/DoS's hands are/were tied (which I contend they are not, but the scope of executive branch power is of course murky) that does not mean we cannot criticize the policy. I'm not out here personally denouncing everyone who's ever put on the ICE uniform. Congress could/should have given emergency provisions such that we never had to rely on ICE to make a decision either way.. . So let's summarize:. . 1. They want to come. . 2. No one says they should be kept out if they have in-person classes (unless you are?). . 3. They can't get jobs here if campuses are closed, so they won't be ""taking away"" jobs from Americans. . . 4. They're not eligible for public assistance/welfare, so they won't be benefiting from funds that could be used to support Americans. . 5. Therefore, they must have the resources to be self-sufficient, and be spending money in local economies.. . I say, if we're not closing our borders with their countries of residence, let them in. Fully understanding that it's at a break in standard policy. Of course I'm biased and read the law looking for an angle, but I think you could even massage the interpretation of 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G) in such a way that it would be totally within the scope of the law.

I was literally told that they would not take me on after I explained that I needed more than that because of my bipolar and my emails went unanswered. I went to UHS for help and they gave me a doctor doing her residency at the hospital and a list of Ann Arbor therapists that fit with my insurance of which one called back and two did not.

I do think the difference is probably that I knew what I wanted and advocated for it directly and powerfully. I wasn't using them as my first line of help, I was solely using it as a crisis service. . .

It wasn't urgent so it was fine, but that was also the problem with the appointment. It wasn't super urgent, my life wasn't in danger, it wasn't tanking my academics, etc. So I got a referral list and a list of groups (neither of which I used) and that was that. in retrospect though, i have no idea what i wanted. due to my family and their views and the insurance situation, there was no way i could go to therapy. so what did i want from caps? i don't know. if i had been more aware of the purpose of caps and what they do, i think i would have been better served. or if i had actually used things off the list. but i didn't know what i wanted out of it and i didn't know what to do with the resources and so i just walked away. . . I definitely think that experience embodies the more common visit that people have but I think it comes down to a couple factors. I don't necessarily expect people to always have these. in a crisis situation, just go. if you're going to any kind of therapy or psychological services in a non crisis situation, having these ready will make your experience much better imo. The thing about caps is that it's time limited, so you won't have as much time to explore these out like you might in 1-2 first therapy sessions. The good news is you don't need a novel for any of them, but it helps people help you (wherever you get services):. . 1) have an idea of what an outcome looks like. . (do you want to see a psychiatrist and consider medication for a long standing issue? are you having trouble managing academic stress and want some strategies for managing anxiety? do you want to be drinking less?). . 2) advocate for yourself. . (tell them what outcome you want, tell them if something they say seems realistic. if you can't afford therapy with your normal insurance, ask them for sliding scale lists. be direct about that, it helps them too!). . 3) know why you're there. . the best help I personally ever got was when I came in during a (fun but not fun lol) hypomanic episode that I realized was problematic, and I was directly trying to resolve that issue.

I do think it can be difficult because it's largely the first time you'll have to get help for yourself and no one else can get it for you (and for a lot of people, their first time needing help altogether). but i think sometimes the issue is that people don't treat it like they would seeing a therapist or something similar. they try to bridge that gap but it's always gonna be more effective for you if you can pin down what you want a bit and then they can say stuff like ""oh we have this group on coping with anxiety, let's try to get you in that"" and give you specific therapist recommendations and resource recommendations. . . and personally i think they should give caps more funding, because everyone i've worked with has been kind and compassionate but i don't think there's enough of them. alas, we don't have any funds right now so i just hope it avoids cuts. that said, i've waited unholy amounts of time for regular therapists so there might actually be a therapist shortage everywhere lol",3.0,error,0.0

So it's not tax policy that drives the decision. But that concept in itself is worth talking about: giving a tax break for donations isn't a trick or game--it's a conscious decision on the part of policymakers. They want to encourage people to give to charities and nonprofits, and allowing them a tax break when they do so it one form of encouragement. They're saying, ""these donations are good enough for the country that it's worth giving up a little tax revenue."" It would be great if people just gave out of the goodness of their hearts, but the government is willing to give them this additional nudge.. . Back to endowments; They are a way that a donor can ensure their gift will be a steady stream of resources so that an institution can keep doing its work in the future. Those resources will keep flowing, even if the donors gets interested in something else or dies. They will keep flowing even if the economy gets tough.. . Scholarships are a good example.. . . . Let's say your favorite professor, Dr. Walnut, retires and lots of alums want to honor him with a scholarship. They all chip in, big donors and small donors, and they come up with $200,000 for the Dr Walnut Honorary Scholarship Fund. Now, they could give it all out at once, and so 20 lucky students would each get a $10,000 scholarship. That's fantastic. But then it's over. They've given out 20 Dr. Walnut Honorary Scholarships this year and there is no mechanism to honor him next year or ten years down the road. They can rally people to donate again for more scholarship money, and some will, but keep in mind those donors are getting other requests too. Dr. Acorn down the hall is retiring and they're thinking about how to honor her, et cetera. At some point the alums who remember Dr Walnut will pass away and it's going to be harder to convince new people to give money to honor a professor they don't know.. . So what if they, instead, made it an endowed scholarship? They put the $200,000 in an endowed fund and let it earn interest. They can't ever touch the $200,000 after they do that, but they can use the interest. If they take just 5% of the interest they will have $10,000 to give away in scholarships each year. That means only ONE student gets it this year, instead of 20 students. But they can give it again the next year. And the next year. And so on. Every year, they get to honor Dr. Walnut with this scholarship, and they will keep honoring him for \*decades.\* His name and legacy will live on and dozens and dozens of students will benefit, over time. This doesn't depend on donors remembering to write a check each year--it's already been set up to last into perpetuity.. . If you don't know how endowment works, then it can look weird to see that there is $200,000 in this endowed scholarship fund. There are needy students out there! Why is that money sitting in the fund and not going to students? It seems fishy but it's not--it's how endowments work.. . Big donors may make similar decisions about gifts to causes like health research. They don't want a university to set up a massive research lab and then have to potentially downsize or even shutter it when the donated money is all spent. So instead, they give the money as an endowed fund. They may have to get off to a smaller start, (since the gift itself can't be spent), just like the scholarship people could only give one scholarship instead of 20. But the interest it generates, year in and year out, means this work will continue no matter what else happens.",1.0,error,0.0

t1_fzjcej0,2020-07-28 18:17:57,t1_fzjativ,t3_hzgqkz,"I think the ""a chunk of your class is failing"" thing has a few factors:. . One, MTU is much less selective. They will take a B+ average high school student (who definitely didn't get into Michigan and might not have gotten into MSU) and let them grind and do the work and hopefully earn a BSE. And like you said, the curriculum is not significantly less challenging. (I would argue that's partially due to ABET standards.) So sometimes that works out, other times they fail out. . . Then there's the fact that there are fewer good non-engineering majors to switch to. So someone who might have switched into LSA, SI, etc. at Michigan stays in their engineering major - even if they don't love it or aren't good at it - dragging down average GPAs for a program. . . --. . If you're okay with corny ""school spirit"" things to do, I would argue that there are things to do up there. Yes, many of them probably still involve booze. (But so did most students orgs I knew at UM - at least unofficially.) People I knew who joined their pep band / a sports team / Greek life / etc. or loved outdoor sports seemed to have a good time. . . --. . I agree that the career fair and placements rival UM for regional employers in traditional engineering fields / companies. That was my example with the Ford College Graduate program. John Deere would be another great example, and nothing to shake a finger at. . . I think there's less exposure to some niche engineering fields (IOE, NERS, NAME, Data Science, etc.) and less exposure to some less traditional job placements for engineers like strategy consulting. Which isn't even something that every engineering student wants or needs. . . For example, my Fortune 100 employer that isn't an ""engineering company"" in a major midwest city doesn't recruit at MTU. But we also don't recruit at MSU. So really it's just the difference between being at a ""target"" school for things other than engineering (UM) or not. . .

Spring and Summer semesters are a bit different. I've had a Master's student as my GSI for a non-lab class during Spring.. . In terms of competitiveness, priorities definitely go to PhD students first, then Master's students. Your department matters as well. They'd want to hire those from their departments first, before hiring students from outside the departments.. . Then there's experience as well. If you have teaching experience before, that is favorable. Though this isn't to say that if you have none, you'd be disqualified. . . And then expertise of the subject matter. If you have taken the class that you're applying to teach for, that'd be a plus. In my experience, it's a combination of these three things (student status and department, teaching experience and expertise in subject matter) that are being considered for the position.

This a much broader issue of quality control in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programming at the University of Michigan and is not only confined to sexual violence like the letter is trying to legally restrict it to. Interpersonal violence by tenured faculty is rampant and uncontrolled when it occurs, when they knowingly have the legal protection of UofM, this is a major anti-trust issue with racism too. . . . . First - ""The university also needs to develop ways to better capture and, when appropriate, act on anonymous reports and information we receive from those who do not wish to file a formal specific complaint."" . . Then- ""they discovered something I had missed in 2019 - an anonymous allegation of misconduct by Philbert. I sincerely regret that. Had I seen it, I would have reported it immediately to the Office for Institutional Equity for evaluation."" . . (Punctuation Error - Had I seen it, --> Had I seen it;). . . . . . How is it that the same person and group of individuals that turned a blind eye to this data before are given trust to reform the system? Honestly, it took a third party to drag them into legal jeopardy to even uncover this, let alone force accountability for it, which was not addressed directly.. . While all this was happening, this letter([https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/letters-to-the-community/duty-to-report/](https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/letters-to-the-community/duty-to-report/)) was posted on the duty to report at UofM under his direction a month before the reporting incident. I agree with the report's recommendations, but do not see who else can be held responsible besides those who accepted this task in institutional accountability. Especially those who have the extent of the financial endowment of the University in control, and are/is able to command funds to urgent tasks. . . To my understanding(if anyone knows better please correct me), the very responsibility to process AEW surveys and report to the OIE was stripped from the Provost's office in 2018 and given to the President in the absence of a DEI oversight body due to this explicit conduct by Philbert. This means other issues not related to sexual violence but related to DEI may have also been glossed over by those accountable, and is a black hole in the system if only sexual violence/Title IX is addressed. . . Shame on those implicit, negligence on their part to address a report of a sexual predator in our community should not be excusable regardless of how it is expressed, as a matter of accessibility for victims or witnesses. It is degrading the institution as a whole and enables the toxic culture it is saying it needs to amend. I hope for change and justice for those suffering to find justice, whether it be against sexual violence or any other identity or environmental related violence, let alone a lack of liability in place throughout the institution due to departmentalization. This lack of internal accountability leaves everyone choosing to deal with the institution at a continual risk of economic, social, and environmental injustice which is unacceptable for students and workers alike. . . . . Excerpt from report specifically on the reporting incident for context: . . *""On April 30, 2019, President Schlissel received his 2019 AEC survey results. The anonymous narrative comments included allegations that Philbert was a ""sexual predator."" The University has established channels, including anonymous channels, for reporting sexual misconduct. The AEC survey is not a reporting channel. However, the AEC survey is a way for faculty to make statements to senior officials, and the premise of the upward evaluation process is that the official being reviewed will receive and read those statements. 141President Schlissel has no recollection of having read the comment. We did not find that President Schlissel (or anyone else in the President's office) had knowledge of the comment in the 2019 AEC survey regarding Philbert. We did find that, as of April 2019, he had access to that comment. Based on the nature of the survey, while the President was not required to read it, we understand he may have been expected to read it. President Schlissel acknowledged that had he reviewed the comment, he would have routed it to OIE. In light of OIE's responsibility for reviewing and investigating sexual harassment complaints, we believe that would have been the correct course of action.""*. . . .

Because the information I have was given specifically to residential community staff, it is still possible that housing won't move you or give you a roommate at all and will respond similarly to previous years. People can still drop their contracts until the 14th and contracts are also going to be made available specifically for the winter term, so there are a lot of logistical things related to housing that still have yet to be sorted out even so close to move-in. My best advice would be to email housing yourself in order to get a straight answer. Hopefully this helps you :)",1.0,neutral,0.7481123208999634

I continued with my project a year after and it gave me a lot of good experience.. . I was blown away at how little people care about your image. Shifting from high school you worry about your image, gossip here and there, etc. In college no one is going to judge you for wearing sweats 7 days a week or wearing clothes that you're not used to. It's really just a free for all. Also learning is hard. I was top of my class in HS and was humbled within 2 weeks of college. You have to learn how to learn and see what works for you, which I think is the most important thing you gain out of going to college. (Not $120k worth but I digress). .

For anyone else who is curious about it, I did a bit of digging since Twitter threads are not the best place to hear out both sides, so I'll sum up what I found here (this was about 20 minutes of digging through videos and stories on Instagram and Twitter; tried to make the account as unbiased and factual as possible but could have made mistakes, feel free to correct where appropriate):. . Girl on USF's campus created an account similar to @atUmich where assault/harassment survivors can send the names of the assailants. The account (not sure it exists anymore, but was run by instagram user @nanichianese) released the list in a tweet which ended up getting retweeted by hundreds. It seems that what the boy was accused of was not sexual assault, as many on Twitter were claiming, but verbal (ie purely non physical) sexual harassment. It appears he tried to contact his accuser to get it sorted out, but I don't think she responded (his defense was that his previous comments were jokes, but unlike most who hide behind that reasoning, he in his messages did seem genuinely remorseful, and these were messages shown on @nanichianese's story, so there wouldn't be a bias in that direction). The boy ended up committing suicide due to the allegations (slightly relevant to note that he had made a suicide attempt a year prior for an unrelated reason). @nanichianese is aware of this and stands by her decisions.. . I don't think it's fair to call this one a ""false allegation"" as many are saying, but perhaps it is more accurate to say it is a possibly overblown allegation. I think verbal comments are still serious and should be taken seriously, but many people accused the boy of being a rapist over a verbal comment simply because they didn't bother to check the full facts and blanketed all the cases similarly. The boy was not accused of being a rapist or even an assaulter, which I think is a pretty significant difference.",5.0,neutral,0.780055820941925

I was an undergrad, and one of my worst experiences with a GSI was when I had reached out for additional help on course topics and asked to meet outside of office hours (because they were usually quite busy since there was just one GSI in the class), and he told me he couldn't and that it would be unfair to other students. The latter part really made an impression on me, and I really struggled with asking for help since then because I didn't want to be a burden (spoiler alert: I ended up failing the course and my graduation date got set back). . On the flip side, one of my best GSI experiences was when a GSI took the time to help dig deeper into a question I had to help correct a deeper misunderstanding I had about a background concept for a particular homework question, and we even chatted a bit about what the imposter syndrome was. I hadn't heard of it before, but knowing there was a word to describe how I had felt for all of college really helped me feel better about everything I was going through. He stuck around on our class q&a forum (piazza) until like 2AM answering questions; I don't know how he did it, but there's something incredibly soul-affirming about getting not only homework advice, but also life advice, in those isolating quiet morning hours in . . Your approach may depend on the classes you teach, but I think if you just try to encourage your students to do their best and understand that this might be new and uncharted territory for them. maybe they transferred schools or switched majors or didn't start college right after high school, maybe they're in your class because they're filling out random requirements for their major and have NO idea what's happening because there was only an optional prereq and they didn't have enough tuition/financial aid to enroll in more classes than they absolutely needed. . . I think being understanding of different communication and/or learning styles will go a long way.

I second the recommendation to go to office hours--even if your class is online, professors should have virtual office hours or you can ask to have an appointment. I think the trick for going to office hours as an introvert is making a purpose for your visit instead of going in there to just have a chat. I always bring a few talking points written down, usually related to assignments for the class or projects I am working on that overlap with the topic of the class. In addition I almost always make appointments via email with professors before I show up. Having to wait behind someone chatting in a professor's office indefinitely makes me anxious, but with appointments I can prepare for a specific time and know that's when I'll meet with them. . . . As an undergrad I was really bad at going to office hours, so when I applied for grad school I leaned heavily on recommendations from professors I had independent study courses with and my advisor, which were professors I had to have one on one meetings with. . . However, when I was first starting out freshman/sophomore year and needed letters for scholarships and such asking turned out to be easier than I thought. Even though I was the quiet kid in class, professors noticed my work. I'm sure since you are getting As your work is probably getting noticed too. Also once you ask for a letter you can build that relationship more (say thank you, follow up with your successes applying to stuff, meet with them occasionally) and ask them for other letters later on. Since they already wrote for you it's less of a hassle to tweak the same letter and send it, and they'll have known you longer and can add the details that really make the letter strong.",4.0,neutral,0.7228114604949951

More Info: . Generally speaking, The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) calculates a different budget for students living at home. In the past these were called ""commuter"" students because anyone living at home but enrolled would be commuting to campus. With online classes it's now possible for you to live at home without commuting so they need a new term. But for now I'd call a student like this a ""commuter"" student.. . The budget for commuter students for room/board is something like $5K, so it reduces the total cost of attendance. So yes, it could reduce your need and your aid package.. . People who cancel their residence hall assignment to live somewhere else off-campus, but still independently, would not have a different budget. OFA uses the housing/dining contract as a proxy for the cost of living in the Ann Arbor area as a student away from family. Some students will spend more that they did to live in housing, and some students will spend less than they did to live in housing, but it's accepted that OFA will just use a standard amount (derived from UM Housing contracts) for everyone in that situation.. . It's not clear to me how financial aid will verify the status of people on aid to know whether they are living at home vs. independently. They need to make some effort though--federal regulations prohibit schools from providing more need-based aid than warranted by the cost of attendance.

t1_g1hinin,2020-08-14 21:14:50,t3_i9skod,t3_i9skod,"I think one of the biggest factors people forget about is that even if your family loves you and you all get along fabulously, it can be hard for some people to work in their home environment. Getting schoolwork done can be hard in an environment with people who might be loud or not fully respectful of the time you set aside for school.. . It can also be hard if you don't have a dedicated place to work or if your wifi at home is subpar to moderate (video calls can be super taxing, campus wifi is also going to be wildly fast). College work will be really hard and can be very time consuming, no matter how hard you pushed yourself in high school. You want to put yourself in the best possible environment to succeed. If you had an online end to senior year, ask yourself how hard it was to really commit to being a fully present and hard working student (I know it's second semester senior year lol but imagine it was something where you really needed to work for it).. . Another thing that I think is especially relevant for first years is that your first semester of college is also about being away from home semi-for good for the first time. That can be a really important adjustment. You can make that second semester of this year, but this semester will have a break in November and winter break shortly on its heels--winter semester won't have any breaks. Breaks can be really valuable in a time of your life when you might have no idea of how much you'll miss your family.. . As for social life, it won't be non existent. From what I know, the dorms are going pod style to mimic households and reduce transmission risk (if someone does get sick, only a small unit needs to quarantine and the rest of the dorm isn't being put at risk). In my experience, most dorm friends you make will have been in your hall anyways, and that will still be available. . . Meeting up with people in small, socially distanced groups outside during the nice weather in September/early October will likely be an option for people you meet through class and clubs. By the time colder weather rolls around, you should know what people you're willing to let in your ""bubble"" (obviously, you still need to be really safe and cautious and limit that bubble to the friends you're close with and trust. I have a few best friends who live in or near Ann Arbor who I am willing to hang out indoors with because we each hang out with very few people right now and I have a high level of trust in them and recognize them to be responsible people).. . What will be missing is the parties. And large, raucous, social gatherings. Those probably won't (really should not) be back next semester either. Or for awhile. If that is how you intended to meet people, and it's something you consider integral to having a worthwhile social life on campus, you probably won't be able to have the experience you want.. . However, speaking from personal experience, I partied in large groups for the first month or so of my first year before I realized it kind of wasn't my thing. I still went to some house parties throughout the rest of that year and the next, but it wasn't as big of a part of my social life as I might have expected. Are those house parties fun? Yeah, mostly. But I get just as much social enjoyment from having 1-2 friends over and messing around, watching netflix, playing games, etc. That's where most of my meaningful social experiences have come from, i.e. the ones that make me happy to be here and make my life feel complete. Not saying the parties aren't fun, just saying that it's not as much of a factor in my social fulfillment as I thought they would be.. .

But maybe gen chem would be a nice way to get the hang of science classes at umich while boosting your science GPA with material you theoretically already know. As a warning though, it's not super easy so up to you. If you decide to skip it, pchem is gonna teach you the same material in even greater depth so MCAT foundation should be fine. 2. nah. 3. you can spam professors in medical specialties you're interested in with emails asking if you can volunteer and help them with research. There are student orgs that volunteer weekly with Syrian refugees in metro Detroit. Likewise, lots of volunteer student orgs you can look into and see if any of them appeal to you. Also, it's really easy to start your own org and it looks really good in the leadership section of your med school app. 4. I personally thought bio 171/172 were really easy if you're the type of person who likes to just watch lectures and memorize PowerPoints straight up. On the other hand, a lot of my friends thought it was super hard because you just need to sit down and memorize a lot of details. But it's basically how med school classes are so it's good if you're into it. On the other hand, chem is a lot more critical thinking but med school is nothing like that. 5. lol like 75% of people you talk to will be premed, just try to find the ones who are chill about it and not too serious but not lazy either. It'll help you guys keep each other on track. Overall, you might feel like everyone around you is smarter than you, but it'll be fine. I always felt like the dumbest kid in my science classes but here I am. Just try your best in your science classes and ace your other classes and you'll be in good shape. Lots of people will be supportive but lots of people will also be really reluctant to help others. For the most part, the former tend to be more successful in the end. 6. urop and orgo should be fine. I did urop, bio 172, and pchem at the same time my sophomore year and didn't feel like it was too much but obviously take easier classes for your major when your science classes are going to be hard",12.0,error,0.0

t1_g21p9xj,2020-08-18 23:52:13,t1_g21jxy7,t3_icamuy,"I actually agree with a lot of what you're saying here, but I look at it a little differently. Our main disagreement is that I think money is certainly a huge factor in the university trying to have an in-person semester at all. I don't understand the university taking on the logistical nightmare that is testing and tracing Covid cases if it weren't for the fact that they are able to keep campus housing open. I do expect students will get a refund as other places have done, but I just think trying to have the amount of on-campus housing they are is a disaster waiting to happen and a decision that was made with finances in mind.. . For your other points:. . 1. I understand that students were always going to come back to AA in off-campus housing (if I had already signed a lease, I would do the same) and I also recognize there would always be students who are not social distancing regardless of school policy. My belief is that the university could have done a better job at making instruction remote. Instead of operating with the mindset of ""what can we keep in-person"" they should have made decisions with the mindset of ""what classes can't be remote"". This is not the way they have made decisions about courses, even if the majority of courses are still remote. If only classes that necessitate being in-person were in-person, then I wouldn't be as worried about people partying and not social distancing. They can put themselves at risk all they like, but when they start unnecessarily exposing others to their poor decisions because the university is allowing them to, then I have a problem. The university should have created a better plan for mitigating risk caused by people who will inevitably not follow policy and they haven't done this . . 2. I always expected classes to be online. Maybe there are some people on here that hoped to be more in-person, but I'm not one of them. I've been advocating being fully remote since the beginning of all of this. I understand the decrease in quality this can have to some courses, but I've always felt that the safety of our families and communities is more important. As someone who turned down a full ride scholarship to another university just to go to Michigan for the quality of education it can bring me, I think I understand the frustration and disappointment from people pretty well.. . 3. As for tuition, I never thought it would go down nor do I think it should just because classes are online. The set-up/materials for online courses can be just as expensive, so I totally understand tuition being the same or higher. I don't think administration's decision to increase tuition was a money grab anymore than it has been a money grab in previous years. . . For myself, I've opted to continue my education at home. I don't feel safe returning to university housing because I don't believe they have created a good plan for testing and tracing or done a proper risk assessment on their reopening. I feel like they are, in some way, scamming people by trying to have regular campus housing. Giving students (particularly freshman) some hope that they can have a semi-normal semester when that clearly won't be the case by a long-shot. That is why I am angry and why I will be even angrier if they wait for everyone to move-in to dorms before they pull the plug",8.0,error,0.0

That said, I definitely see your points about the risk of bringing students back to campus. This is where I see the plan's stumbling points. First is communication. I think a lot of the anxiety we're seeing now could be alleviated if the admin followed a line like ""stay online unless you need an in-person class, in which case campus is as safe as we can make it."" Instead we have these peachy descriptions and a lot of bluster about how anyone who wants to come back can do so. If anything's financially motivated, it's this.. . Second is testing.

I was lucky enough to have Nolta for Orgo 1 and she basically ran through and gave answers to every course pack problem, which was a big help. I ended up finishing the class with an A-. For Orgo 2 I ended up having Poniatowski, and as far as I'm aware he didn't give out and work through all of the course pack problems, only a select few that people asked about. With Poniatowski I worked through every textbook problem that he suggested and compared my answers with those given in the textbook study guide. I didn't even touch or open the course pack and got a perfect score on the first, and second exam and ended up finishing Orgo 2 with an A. I really think a big point in getting the textbook would be to have a way to check yourself and make sure you're doing problems correctly as long as you legitimately attempt problems before checking the answer. The study guide for the textbook gives out all the answers to the textbook problems in relatively good detail when applicable. It all really just boils down to how you learn though and what method works best for you. From my experience, I would definitely recommend the textbook and the study guide (don't buy a paper copy, textbook should have a link inside for a free study guide) because it's a method of checking yourself and practicing which has as many questions and problems as you could ever want, and is pretty much an unlimited reference in terms of what you'll do in the course. However, if you do have a prof. like Nolta who is sort of known for giving out a lot of course pack answers for checking yourself then it might not really be as necessary as it would be for a prof. that doesn't do so.",4.0,positive,0.6512418985366821

My personal interpretation of this (I do not speak in any official capacity in this case) is that the fewer people are in a building, the safer they are (fewer people to run into in the hallway, share a bathroom or elevator or stairwell, touch the same surfaces). There are some people -- staff, researchers, technicians, students -- who must be in the buildings to do their jobs (I count taking classes as a job), or to get necessary business done, at certain times. The more those of us who don't HAVE to be there can stay out of their way, the safer everybody is.. . The above are just my *feelings*. More formally, outdoors, there don't seem to be any limits (especially in areas away from the dorms, where there will be a lot of action this week). Indoors, every department has their official re-entry plan that covers access policies to buildings that the department ""owns."" It seems that most discourage unplanned visitors, and might require check ins ahead of time, etc. As the op said, Pierpont (for example) doesn't seem to address the question of visitors on their website -- I'd suggest calling their info desk first, to find out (+17349360869). Same goes for any department building -- they said they are open to the students, but if you want to bring in visitors, either find and review their re-entry plan, or call the front office.
