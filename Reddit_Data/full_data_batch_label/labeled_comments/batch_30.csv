It was the weeder classes like STATS 250 where I had to write sentence in an exact way or get points taken off. I don't think it makes me smarter in terms of material, it's just more stuff to study, if that makes sense. This might sound undermining, but it's only undergrad.

But I wouldn't say the same compared to Boston U; I think the quality of instruction is probably similar, but if anything, U-M's engineering school may be more highly regarded. U-M's engineering college is larger, so it may offer greater variety in certain areas. Again, as an undergrad, that's less significant, as math and science basics are similar everywhere, but when you look at the 400/500-level courses within an engineering department, typically selected in your senior year, that variety can make a meaningful difference in your education, and better prep you to launch a career within a field you're really interested in.",1.0,positive,0.7545941472053528

Ultimately minors don't matter all that much, particularly as a CS student.

OUTDOORS (for when the weather actually cooperates):. - Munger rooftop if you can get up there. It's so pretty!. . - Alice Lloyd has chairs on their outdoor patio facing the field. . - Argo Nature Area has picnic tables and there's nice parks and cafes nearby. I went there often last year when I needed to do readings/copy from textbook, or I write on Google Docs offline.. . . . JANK SHIT:. These are not so much recommendations but rather examples of the endless possibilities~. . - I've snuck onto the rooftop lounges of those expen$ive apt buildings. You just wait for someone to open the front door and when they scan into the elevator ask them to hit the top floor. Six11's rooftop lounge is Gorgeous, the view is insane, and they had complimentary coffee last I was there. The Hub has the lounge on the ground floor which you literally just walk in.. . - Weirdest place I've ever studied has got to be the University Hospital but HONESTLY would do again 10/10. I actually went a few times when everything was closed last year. They have little rest areas scattered about, patios, and the cafeteria.. . - The Burton Memorial Tower. The view was nice, but the classrooms are kinda stuffy and the carillon is LOUD so it's more a novelty than anything.",25.0,error,0.0

Nearly all social things happen down on central, such as parties, events, etc. This is where the town and shopping areas of the AA/campus integration are. Classes down here are generally all of the non-eng or art/theater/architecture ones.. . In central, there's different areas of significance. You can map these using the landmarks on google maps. . . - The Diag & surrounding: this is what most ppl refer to as central, since it's where university buildings are centralized. Very obvious square shaped patch on google maps. Most classes are here and it's always full of students. No housing in this area, it's the actual university campus part of central so it's all classes (Angell/Mason hall, Dana Building, Weiser Hall), libraries (Shapiro , Hatcher), and the art museum (UMMA). . . - State Street: Borders the left side of the diag and extends farrrrr down past campus. The part near central has most of the non-university action. Restaurants, the Target, cafes, theaters, etc. Up top and to the left on East Huron you'll find tons of apartment buildings, tho they're pretty pricey. There's the Hub, the YOUnion, foundry lofts, etc.. . - The Hill: the northernmost part (up and to the right) of Central campus. The borders are Geddes Ave by the CCTC bus station, and it kinda encircles it up top. Landmarks are Palmer Commons, Mojo dorm, the Museum of Natural Science. This is where public health is located. It's mostly student dorms up there, the public health building is kind of an outlier. The medicine campus is also nearby. About a ~15 min walk to the Diag. Since it's mostly dorms, you would have to go a little bit down on Observatory St before you hit off campus housing. . . - Kerrytown: No classes are here, it's like another shopping district. It has some apartment housing. It's next to the Old Fourth Ward which also has some housing, but that's mostly houses.. . - South Central: kinda when you pass the UMMA you get into South Central. It has South Quad (form + dining hall), West Quad, Ross Business school, Ford School of Public Policy, and Law Quad. There's some housing to the left, mingled in with the dorms and frat houses.. . - South University Ave and to the right: so basically once you pass Joes Pizza on SouthU you're gonna hit another restaurant/food area. There's housing kinda surround here, like University towers apts, South Forest Ave, and the frat houses/co-ops once you hit Washtenaw and go down. There's also some pricey apartments here, like six11.. . - South South Central/Athletic Campus: once you pass the Ford school is where I'd mark it, as there's not any university academic buildings down here. Its mostly athletic areas, like fields and gyms. Landmarks would be like the Intramural Sports Building, Yost Ice Arena, the Golf Course, etc. Lots of housing here the further you go. Mostly houses and house apartments, but there's some apt buildings like 711 Arch, State street village, etc.. . ----NORTH CAMPUS----. . mostly the art schools and engineering. I'm not very familiar with the layout as I've only lived on central so I can't get very in-depth.. . Pros:. - it's emptier and has more space. - it's not as loud. - housing is cheaper up here and there's more options. - more parking options too . - it's very pretty, and has a lot of nature up there. . Cons:. - it's far from central (like public transport or car far), which is where most of the action happens. . - if you have classes on central (which you will) it can be a hassle to get down there, especially if they're morning classes. You'd have to ride the blue buses. You may think that you can drive, but in general I wouldn't recommend it as parking is unreliable and expensive, and you may have to park in a commuter lot to bus in anyways.. - geese. .

At the very least $1.4k.. . I recommend you start digging into the leasing companies around here ASAP. There's going to be 2 options, essentially: apartment buildings and house apartments, which are houses that have been sectioned off into individual apartments (each has its own kitchen and bathroom and all that too).. . You should also look on the [off campus housing website](https://offcampushousing.umich.edu/housing/campus-University+of+Michigan+--+Central+Campus/beds-1). Just make sure that the lease is for the school year, and not the summer, since people are subletting out now. Other places to look are by contacting leasing companies directly, Facebook groups, etc. . . Here's some that popped up on the housing website, I didn't look into them in detail.. .

[1.5 miles, $910](https://offcampushousing.umich.edu/housing/property/1550-jones-drive/ocpnkn64qp). . For parking, yes. It does tend to get expensive though. The university has color-coded lots that you can buy a parking pass for, and if you want long term storage there's parking spaces in lots on North that are a somewhat okay price but you have to fill out an application, since they get snatched up quickly. You can also buy a parking spot from someone who doesn't have one, but this is pricey. If you search in this subreddit for more on parking there's posts that will explain it more.. . Finally, having a good or terrible apartment can really make or break your experience here. Take it from someone who's been in bad housing. Landlords can get real scummy and there may be hidden downsides they won't mention, so while it is late don't rush into it and sign without making sure it's suitable and liveable. My current housing I was not made aware that we were unable to control the temperature, so many nights it's 90degF+, and others are at 55.

I am procrastinating studying for my last final exam and it's much more fun to answer your question instead.. . 1. I'm a senior taking a major in the Program in Biology right now, and there are lots of options for finding research positions! One awesome choice (that I was not part of, but many of my bio friends were) is the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP). You can apply as a freshman or as a sophomore. You take a one-credit, low-effort seminar and they help you match with a professor and project to do independent research that you present at a symposium at the end of the year. There's no guarantee that you find a project, but there's a high chance. This is a great option because finding research as a freshman or sophomore is more difficult on your own. You can also try to find research on your own. Cold emailing professors, speaking with your profs about their research. I have found research positions on the student jobs page! There's lots of options and lots of really cool work going on re: conservation bio here at Michigan. Be forewarned though, that outside of UPOP, it can be difficult (but not impossible) to find profs who will take on an underclassmen. There's plenty of opportunities for juniors and seniors if you look.. 2. To my knowledge, there are no POLICIES of grade deflation in the Program in Biology. At least, not in any of the classes that I have taken. I have also never encountered any profs who curve down. Most intro bio/biochem/chem/etc. classes are graded on a grading scale that's more generous, e.g. a 65-75 is a C instead of 70-75, and so on. STEM classes are difficult here, that's no debate, but you are not competing against your classmates. I have never encountered a traditional ""curve"" in any of my PIB classes -- others may have different experiences.. 3. I am not an OOS student, but there's plenty of OOS students here. Most I've encountered do end up paying full price, as UMich is notoriously stingy with scholarships. If you can get out of UMich with a reasonable and manageable amount of loans, and you are okay with taking them out, I think a degree from Michigan is well worth this cost. You, and others, may have different thoughts on that, though.. 4. There are Asian markets on/near campus! Kanbu Asian Mart is super close to campus, right down one of the main streets into downtown (there's probably others close to campus as well, but this is not my area of expertise). There's definitely plenty of Asian markets in driving/bus range off campus as well.. . ETA: don't underestimate internships! There are plenty of summer programs through UMich in conservation biology and ecology and related fields of study. They can count as credits and are great experiences that will look awesome on a resume! Internships through non-UMich companies/organizations/governmental departments can also be an option if you cannot find research for the summertime or if you simply want to do something other than research over the summer. I am biased toward internships because I'm taking my bio degree into industry rather than academia, but it's good to keep an open mind!",30.0,error,0.0

They are both heavily proof based classes so be prepared for that. If you aren't familiar with proofs, just do 217 and take 465 later. Otherwise, it'll be doable. . . I can't speak to English 125, but EECS 280 is very variable on the amount of time depending on how much coding experience you have. If you're more familiar, then it shouldn't be too time intensive. However, if you've only ever coded in 183 and don't have much outside experience, it can be a time sink.. . In total, it's a doable, but heavy schedule depending on if you have proof experience. Otherwise, you're setting yourself up for failure. Especially after reading your line about putting in 0 work for courses you don't like. I personally enjoyed these courses but if you dont like proofs or find that you don't like them, then this will lead to a terrible semester so be warned.. . EDIT: What major are you planning?

This is especially true in fields like PM where a solid business/engineering background is essential. . . On the contrary, however, the workload is extremely heavy and if you're not coming in with prior credit it's pretty difficult to graduate on time. You will probably be taking 18+ credits a semester, which can tank work-life balance. . . I really would only recommend doing this if you're really passionate about both fields.

Personally, I felt like it was a reasonable courseload, but I have never taken and never will take a Michigan math course so I'm not sure what that combo is like. EECS 280 is not bad if you have previous experience with C++ and a good project partner. EECS 203 was not bad in the fall because we had in-person exams, but as an IA this semester for 203, I know that we've had to write harder exam questions than before in order to prevent people from just looking up the answers for the online exams. Hopefully, we change back to in-person exams next semester :)). I know some people are saying not to take 280 and 203 together your first semester, but it can be pretty advantageous because then you can take 281 in the winter. I did this because I knew that I wanted to do CS for sure. That being said, if you're trying to get an internship after your freshman year, do not wait until you have started taking 281 to apply to internships. Most internship programs start their application processes in the fall so definitely start applying as soon as August when you first get on campus. . I was in the drones section of ENGR 100 and while some of the stuff was cool, the class was mostly just busywork and learning how to write technical papers. It has a pretty moderate workload, but it's just a stupid class with a stupid grading system IMO.

Was averse to trying all three, but learned to appreciate each once I did. I mainly explain these through the scope of anxiety, because that's what I attribute to giving most of the weight to my ""Layers of Stress"" past and present.. . * **Exercise**. Had a manic phase where my anxiety maxed out, just started running, and noticed my mood was improved and more stable. It's like the excess energy I had was somehow converting to anxiety. Eventually discovered lifting has the same effect and transitioned to that.. * Typically the effect would last for about 2.5ish days, and on that third day, like clockwork, my mood would drop sharply and anxiety would start to rise again, but about half an hour of exercise would set things straight again. * **Weed.** Smoked loads of it. There were phases where it really helped me cope with things and ""dial my shit down a bit."" Granted, it's a bit of a double-edged sword, and some people say it makes them more anxious, some discover they only like either indica or sativa strains, but if you've never tried, it can be helpful. I tried it after getting frustrated with how my past anxiety and depression meds all pretty much failed me and relied on it for about two years heavily, for better or for worse. It does make it easy to become totally apathetic though, which y'gotta watch out for if you do get ""really into it"". * When I started, you needed a med-card and I got one for PTSD, but now you can just buy it pretty much anywhere. If you need a dispo recommendation, Bloom City Club.. * **Beta Blockers**. Post-stoner-phase I went back to UHS and said ""I want to try actual meds again but just something non-addictive, for anxiety only, and taken on an as-needed-basis"" and they gave me a beta-blocker that basically just acts as an off-switch for anxiety. Used it through grad school still use it for job interviews and major work presentations, been very satisfied with it.

I'm a GSI (Graduate Student Instructor) in the Math Department, and I've also worked as a math placement advisor for incoming first year and transfer students, so I'll try to summarize your options here:. . You may need credit for Math 115 (Calculus I) and/or 116 (Calculus II) -- and possibly higher level math courses -- as ""prerequisites"" for declaring your intended major (it's absolutely ok if you don't have one yet!). You can find information about degree requirements for all LSA majors at [https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/majors-minors.html](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/majors-minors.html).. . If you haven't taken the AP Calculus exam (or the IB Calculus exam), then you won't be able to get transfer credit for Math 120/121 (equivalent to Math 115/116, respectively). This may or may not be a problem, since it's entirely possible your intended major doesn't require these as prerequisites.. . Depending on your individual math background and familiarity with course material, it's still possible (but not certain!) that your score on the math placement exam can get you out of some of these requirements. There are generally two ways that this can happen:. . 1. Some majors allow students to skip the Math 115 prerequisite if they take Math 116. This information should generally be listed on the requirements section of the major, which you can find at the above link.. 2. SOME departments allow students to skip the prerequisites altogether with a good enough score on the math placement exam. I should really emphasize the word ""some"" here; the vast majority of departments don't have a policy like this.. . In summary, it's not necessarily true that you will have to take Math 115, but it's entirely possible that it's required by your intended major. If you don't have an intended major yet (again, this is absolutely fine!) but you think it's possible that you'll end up majoring in a STEM field, I would recommend taking Math 115, since almost every major of this type has it as a prerequisite.. . Finally, most departments offer individual placement advising so that you can get information more tailored to your individual needs. You can sign up for math placement advising at [https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/advising.html](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/advising.html); in general, you can find a major's placement advising at the above link.",3.0,error,0.0

My one-time experience driving in Europe was that it's a lot harder than here. For example, they have multilevel parking garages with tiny one-way-at-a-time corkscrews with traffic signals to tell you if it's safe to drive up or down. Some are so tight, you wonder how anyone ever makes it without scraping something. And it's easy to get confused just driving around, e.g., by all those exits leading to some town I'd never even heard of called Ausfahrt.. . When I was there, I had a car with a manual and I was fine but that's because that's all I'd ever been driving. It also helped that I had a nav system, which I highly recommend. But driving in Europe the first time is difficult enough that I would not want to add learning to drive stick. You're smart to try learn to drive a stick just in case, but unless you're able to become very confident very quickly, I would try very hard to rent an automatic, even if it is more expensive.",2.0,neutral,0.5149959921836853

I also don't wanna come off like I'm hating on professors either, I think they (and GSIs and TAs) have extremely challenging jobs in which sometimes that very same leeway is a key unspoken perk of the role and emblematic of maybe let's say the power associated with the job (moreso for more established profs than associates or GSIs/TAs). they can utilize that power and leeway (again not just in this instance but in a broader sense) also to push against unrealistic expectations levied against them by administration and their department hierarchy as well, so there is a kind of reasoning behind why some things like this might change on a rather glacial scale.",1.0,neutral,0.6503790020942688

UM is a world leader in research and we have some pretty good resources & opportunities for research here. I obviously can't speak for MSU but the opportunities for research are far and wide -- you just have to put in the effort to contact PIs and you'll eventually get an interview/acceptance. . . As for career outlook, a degree in biochem is a tossup since half of your classmates will be pre-med and the other half will be pre-PhD (usually). UM has strong industry ties so finding an internship or a job post-grad shouldn't be too difficult. In terms of academics and research, I don't think you can rival UM if you're an in-state student. . . One thing I think you should consider is the feel of Ann Arbor vs Lansing. Many people tend to ignore this aspect but you really need to figure out whether the vibes of A2 or Lansing are more suited towards your personality. A huge factor in college is your social life and you don't want to be in a city where you're miserable.. . Feel free to PM me if you have more questions about chem!",4.0,positive,0.7998801469802856

It's a department within mechanical engineering that focuses on the design process and ways that we as engineers can create more equitable solutions for everyone in society. They have a program (minor type thing) that you can take called Program in Socially Engaged Design(PSED). The courses required for this can count towards parts of your MechE degree (count as 400 level tech electives. Example class is MechE 457). The free online courses only count for PSED but are a great free resource that you can speak to for interviews or just experience.

I cannot desribe how valuable that is. Also way easier to keep track of than massive stacks of paper. And you can submit PDFs of assignments that you wrote on it, no scanning required.

LSA has plenty of driven and genuinely smart people not in honors simply cuz they didn't apply or didn't know about it. The main benefit is the guaranteed south quad housing, but it's also not all honors so it really is just like any other dorm (aka it's not necessarily a tight-knit community). That being said, most of the people on my floor were in honors and since those were the people I was surrounded by, the majority of my friends are in honors and they're by no means the ""nerdy say-at-home"" types (so honors in a way did bring me my community, but I likely would've just befriended my floor regardless of honors). Honors is kinda large so there is a wide variety of people (the nerds, partiers, and everyone in between) - you will definitely find the friends you're looking for. Also, the honors program does hold almost weekly events where you can meet other engaged students if you so desire (but I personally didn't attend any of them and just made friends in the dorm). Ultimately, whether the program makes the school feel smaller is entirely up to you and your participation in the program, but either way, there are millions of other ways to make the school feel smaller with the hundreds of clubs/organizations (which are genuinely good sources of communities). You can always make a big school feel smaller, but you can never make a small school feel bigger.. .

However, I do know that they tend to go to the waitlist earlier for the smaller schools such as Kinesiology, Stamps, Taubman, SMI, etc. They usually fill these schools sooner since they are usually in the hundreds of students. For example, they already emailed SMI students and told them they have the max enrolled so they are closing waitlist.. . As for LSA, the waitlist tends to run into late May and June. Since it's a great school, many students may be committed to UM but get accepted off waitlist to Cornell, Harvard, Vanderbilt, etc. Usually many applicants won't be notified until late May. I wouldn't start worrying at all yet because it's a larger school so it takes longer to fill the spots. I haven't heard of anyone being admitted off waitlist for LSA but will come back here if I do. My guess is that they will start in mid to late May.. .
