Like many other 500-level classes, EECS570 is split into two distinct parts, and part 1 operates like a regular class with the following workload (at the time):. . * Read about 4 research papers per week and take ~5 minute online quizzes on each.. * Two projects that take up a reasonable amount of time.. * I believe there was a midterm but my memory is hazy. Assume there is one? :P. . And like many other 500-level classes, part two consists of the following:. . * You pick a topic to write a research paper in.. * No assigned workload, just write the research paper.. * Lectures end. Lecture time becomes office hours for your research paper.. . So yeah, the latter half of the class is a ""void"" with only one goal: giving you the time and space to write a paper.. .

Part of what you're doing at law school (especially a top law school) is making lifelong friends who will support you through school and into your career.

They don't know anyone else, they don't have other friends who live nearby, and there's not much else to do.

They're competing against other sophomores for sophomore level classes, like EECS 280, calc 3, etc, not against freshmen for freshman level classes. Freshmen coming in with no AP credit should have no trouble scheduling for math 115, bio 172, physics 140, etc. The idea that AP credits are screwing over people without AP credits is completely false. The only advantage AP credits give you is being able to finish college in 3 years instead of 4. . While Michigan cares very much about its *4 year* graduation rate, they don't care at all about people graduating in less time than that. In fact, they'd rather have you stick around for 4 years instead of getting out in 3 or 3.5 because then they get to charge you more rounds of tuition. This is specifically about screwing over people that could have graduated in less time and getting them to stay an extra semester or two. I know this because it almost happened to me personally. I avoided having to take 8 semesters because I'm clutch and so is my department, but other students might not be so lucky. But even still, there are several classes I wanted to take that I was never able to because the school considered me a junior when I registered for senior classes.

It has a lot of connections to Detroit, and also reaches into nearby communities like Ypsilanti. There are service projects; outreach; medical, nursing, and dental clinics & services; college prep programs; neighborhood development; various volunteering... a lot of cool stuff.. . It also serves Ann Arbor in a lot of ways, but AA is a fairly affluent college town wrestling with growing issues of affordability. Some Ann Arbor denizens, including some members of the city Council, blame UM for creating the issue, making it much worse, and/or not solving it. They're not entirely wrong, but UM feels like a convenient scapegoat sometimes for problems that go way beyond UM. UM doesn't get sufficient credit for the good things it does in Ann Arbor or its partnerships there, IMO.. . A couple of ways I know SSW specifically serves the area: The SSW has some contracts with the state around child welfare research, and a SSW professor heads up Poverty Solutions which is researching ways to end poverty through real projects in the region. SSW is also working with the Marygrove project in Detroit to infuse trauma informed practice in the school there (you should read about Marygrove, it's very cool with big aspirations for the future of its community).

Michigan has a much less overtly antagonistic relationship with the city of Ann Arbor than Columbia does with its surrounding communities, but a big part of that is a demographics thing: Ann Arbor is a very upper-middle-class city that's largely grown up around the university, so there's much less of a stark divide between the demographics of the community and the university: both are filled disproportionately with people who are white, well-resourced, and highly educated.. . That said, the university and the city often clash. Michigan buying up land cuts into city tax revenues, and city council has long been extremely cozy with landlords, resulting in some of the highest rents for a college town this size in the country. The university could flex its muscle a bit in this regard but doesn't, since high rents mean more students paying full fees.. . As for the city of Detroit, there are a number of partnerships within the university that serve the city, but they're all sort of independent of one another. I wouldn't say there's a broad institutional ethos of service to the Detroit metro area: quite the contrary, I think that most of the time the university attaches itself to a romantic ideal of Detroit but doesn't want to reckon with the city as it actually exists.. . Even as I write all of that, Michigan is a much healthier place than Columbia by almost every metric, and I say this as someone who loved my time there, loved the Core and my major, and did extremely well. There's a far more vibrant campus arts and music scene and a much greater range of people: most people are not laser-focused Type A gunners with career plans in place by freshman year, and they seem to enjoy their time here a lot more than Columbia undergrads enjoy theirs. The university itself is an impersonal and deeply racist institution that happens to have much better PR people than Columbia does, but there are pockets and communities within the university with whom it's very easy to fall in love.

t1_i1sy9cr,2022-03-23 15:12:43,t1_i1ss51j,t3_tjtw8g,">The absurd rental market discourages enrollment from students with lower economic resources, which means the university doesn't need to dole out as much aid. . This is not what the University wants or desires. It has a persistent problem with potential undergrads and their families writing UM off because they *think* UM is too expensive (not just because of local rents, but because of the perception of tuition), that is true. We also have a lot of wealthy students on campus because of the out-os state demographic, and the way UM pulls from affluent MI counties. . . But UM is actively working to discourage the impression and recruit MORE, not fewer, lower-income students. That's the precise aim of the HAIL scholarship program and the Go Blue Guarantee (both of which cover tuition). And while this may be less familiar to you because it's older and doesn't get talked about as much, the MPACT program (eliminating loans from aid packages for the lowest SES students). Because U-M meets *full* demonstrated need for residents (I'm pretty sure it's the only MI public to pledge this), it *also* provides aid for living expenses.. . This requires an enormous amount of institutional resources to offer this aid, because the state of Michigan has defunded nearly all of its former direct aid to residents, but UM keeps on doing it. There is no cheaper 4-yr public university for a lower-income student from Michigan to attend, thanks to our aid policies. That's based on net price. Check out Bridge Magazine's excellent coverage of this.. . If the University wanted to secretly limit the enrollment of lower-income students, it has better ways to do it, quickly and quietly. They could kill MPACT, for example, to increase loans so aid packages are unappealing. They could stop advertising the GBG. They could stop prioritizing who gets to live in the residence halls after freshman year, forcing more lower-income students into a difficult market. They're not doing this, and neither are they secretly applauding landlords in Ann Arbor and hoping they scare away applicants.. . We absolutely have an affordability issue with housing. It doesn't help when it comes to students evaluating what UM will cost them. It is not, however, part of a plot by the University to make sure only rich kids enroll.",2.0,negative,0.6540337204933167

I took it last semester and I had to reevaluate the way I looked at the class as the semester went on cause it's a new type of learning. I know there isn't much I can say on reddit to help, but I what I found helped a lot is to understand WHAT is happening in reactions OVERALL as opposed to trying to look at an individual unique molecule and figuring out what's supposed to happen. I'm not sure if that makes sense. On my second exam (F21 - I'm sure you have access to the practice test), one of the questions asked about a reverse aldol condensation reaction. This ended up throwing off a lot of people because they put so much time into memorizing the order of the exact steps of an aldol condensation, and they didn't end up knowing what the point and generality of an aldol condensation was, meaning they had trouble going backwards in the reverse version. So take some time to understand the generalities behind reactions (overall, what is happening in the reaction, what are you starting with - aldehyde? ketone? etc. - what reactants are there?). . Also, if you get a practice problem wrong, mark it, and always come back to it and try again, always focusing on the big picture of the problem.. . Keep your head up and know that you and OP got this. A lot of people taking orgo are looking to go to medical school. Going through this class is only just a speed bump to help teach you different ways to learn on that path. You all will be great physicians, I promise (and you're gonna pass dw :) ). . .

This will introduce you to several relevant fields. . . Also, find and join an engineering student project team whose culture and approach you fit within. Don't focus more than is necessary on the actual *product* - if none of the space-y ones are a good fit, don't walk away from ones that don't sound like they deal with space, because the *process* and *information* you learn are ultimately more important than the final product as an early engineering student, and you'll learn a lot more on a team you enjoy than one one you force yourself into because it's ""relevant"" or whatever. . . These should both do a good job of showing you at a basic level what you do and don't enjoy - then you can look at the program guides for whatever majors you're most interested in, and take a low-level class from each (for example, I took EECS 215, EECS 280, and MECHENG 214 all in my second semester, giving me exposure to EE, CS, and ME). This is a great way to get a feel for what *courses* in each area might be like, and whether or not you find the material engaging to learn in a rigorous classroom setting. Ideally, try and take courses that apply to as many possible majors as you can - for example, MECH 214 counts as a Flexible Technical Elective for my EE degree - but don't worry too much if you end up taking an extra course or have to spread these out, it's probably worth it if you're still indecisive. . . Ultimately, however, the best piece of advice I can give you is basically ""keep taking more of the classes that don't make you want to die"".

Admittedly, and this may be relevant to you, there is exactly one Major Design Experience (MDE) ""capstone"" course that CE students can take that EEs cannot, EECS 467 (Autonomous Robotics Design), and if you really want to use that as your MDE you're going to need to be CE not EE - but if you want to instead just take another MDE (such as 470 or 473) and take 467 as an elective, you can obviously do that as an EE just fine. . . Other than that though, CE doesn't really offer much else I'm aware of that you couldn't do as an EE.

I'm not working to support myself (my tuition and room & board are being paid for by my parents) and I really like my job, so take that into consideration.

My parents don't cover any of my day-to-day living expenses, so having a job prevents me from digging into my savings all the time.. * I actually love the fact that my job is super not-associated with UM. Getting off-campus and into the community is a really great de-stressor and reminder that there's life outside the university. On the other hand, on-campus jobs are known to be super flexible for students, so they do have some advantages.. * My schedule is such that I work a lot of mornings, so I don't really ""miss out"" on anything because people are either a) in class b/c it's a school day or b) not even up yet.. * Not sure numbers exactly, but lots of people do work.

This is for a few reasons:. . 1. Junior year is almost universally harder than sophomore year, and you don't want a class like that on your plate on top of everything else. . 2. I took AP Comp Sci with not a lot of programming experience, and I got a B-. A couple of other guys who had taken every Java course at our high school failed (probably more laziness on their parts, but still something to keep in mind).. 3. If AP Comp Sci treats you as badly as it did me and my classmates, UM loves to see improvement. They also love seeing students challenge themselves, so you might stand out taking it your sophomore year. You'd also have all of junior year to bring your GPA up if it ends up being just as bad for you. . . \*This is assuming you have programming experience. If you're just interested in computer programming with little to no programming experience, I would take a few more courses before taking on AP. AP courses are, after all, college level. . . In general, UM likes to see that you took advantage of the opportunities you had (so if your school offers 5 AP courses, taking 3 would look pretty good, for example). They also want to see extracurricular involvement (especially leadership positions). Additionally, having good essays is important, so take your time on those. . .

But alas, I am not the most ambitious person so when I wanted to be lazy, take the day off early, etc etc, I did. My organization did not have high expectations for me, and they had no monetary incentive to train me, make me work hard, and keep me there for a full day. . . In my other internship, I was paid. My new organization had high expectation for me, assigned real tasks, deliverables, and projects, allowed me to interface with important clients within and outside the organization, and was overall a much more effective educational experience.. . In the School of Social Work, there were tons of students who were dumb and lazy, but also many who were brilliant and ambitious. I do not think those brilliant, ambitious folks could do what I did and be purposely lazy. That's just not how they're wired. But that means they are then taken advantage of because they're working extremely hard and seeing no real reward. Furthermore, they're graduating with the same stupid, lazy people because there's really no built-in filter in the school to get rid of those kinds of students. So just from a pragmatic and moral point of view, unpaid internships are not it, chief.",9.0,neutral,0.7018757462501526

Me: entered a public university in an honors program. Left after couple of semesters before I could officially be kicked out. Felt all the things you are feeling. I took time off. Got counseling through uni center which helped me figure out how/why I messed up & make start on a plan. My uni was so big, my adviser barely knew who I was; uni counselors had heard it all & even got a semester expunged for mental health reasons. Taking time off felt terrible but was best thing for me. I worked couple of jobs, had time to figure out what I wanted to do -- even more important what I DIDN'T want to do -- and eventually went back with a different major. Later got offered fellowship for grad school, got an Ivy League PhD, been a prof for about 15 years and worked with 100s of students. . . Life isn't a race, if you're lucky it will be a marathon with starts & stops. As a student you have lots of resources: profs, advisers, therapists who can help you find options.. . It is true there are lots of assholes working at colleges so if you find one of those, move on until you find the support you need. There are also good folks who like helping people. Your experience & mine are very common. Also: sometimes college is NOT where you need to be at the time. I've worked with lots of students who start with: ""I've really messed up & I'm a total failure"" but go on to talk about $ problems or addictions, depression, illness/death in their family. Sometimes you need to focus on that; you can always come back later or, maybe you decide to do something without a degree. There are lots of trades -- plumbing, electrical -- that are absolutely essential, can be fulfilling & make good $.. . Bottom line: start reaching out for help.

I highly reccomend living in a double your freshman year. Sure people have roommate horror stories, but (from my time as an RA) most people who live in doubles have an easier time making friends, staying motivated for classes, and not feeling homesick.. . . Each ranking will be out of 5.. . Alice Lloyd:. Overall - 4,. Cleanliness - 5,. Location - 4.2,. Community - 2/4 (2 for normal. 4 for LHSP). . Alice Lloyd, often referred to as Palace Lloyd was where I lived freshman year. The building was really nice, and the rooms were decently big. Bathrooms were cleaned daily and were very modern with large showers. The bathrooms were communal, but I never had any issue with waiting for a shower, sink, or toilet. Because of the frequency of cleaning, the bathrooms were always incredibly clean.. . Pros: it's not too far from Central campus (8 minute walk to the diag). Has a Commuter North bus stop (great for getting to North campus) pretty close by. Air conditioning and plenty modern lounges made it a great hang out spot for friends. Has a kitchen.. . Cons: no dining hall inside. You have to go to Mojo (next door). It's honestly not that bad of a walk, it just kind of sucks in the winter when you have to walk about a minute in the cold to get food. The study spots are almost always full, so it's hard to find a place during busy times. People seemed to already have friends, so I didnt become friends with anyone in my hallway.. . --------------------. . Markley:. Overall - 4.5,. Cleanliness - 3,. Location - 4,. Community - 5 (I would give it a 6. But thay feels like cheating). . I'm a little biased as I lived here for two years as I was an RA for threeves. Markley is a freshman only dorm that is quite old. Sadly, this means no AC, small rooms, and tiny showers. It's situated a bit further away from Central campus (10 minute walk), but is right on top of the commuter north bus stop. So it has a very easy commute to north campus. The bathrooms were supposedly cleaned once a day, but it really felt like twice a week. The toilets were consistently average and the same could be said about the showers. Living here after Alice felt like a massive downgrade in terms of quality of life.. . Pros: super easy access to north, I honestly wish I lived here freshman year. Im my hall, all of my residents who wanted to were able to find very fulfilling social groups who helped them academically, recreationally, and professionally. You get huge windows (I think the biggest of all dorms). Markley has a dining hall (its honestly pretty decent) which means you can get food while still wearing your pajamas. Markley has tons of study space for groups of friends to hang out at and is very close to the arboretum. It also has a snack store called the pantry which is 10/10. Markley == close friend group.. . Cons: NONE. Jk, there's a lot. Rooms are small (11' x 11') on average. Bathrooms are cleaned infrequently. Smells like weed and sounds like parties and alcohol (which may not be a bad thing). It's a tad bit far from downtown (stare and main street). But is close to student downtown (which I consider South U). The mail room is a bit slow because it gets packages for 1200 students and only has 2/3 people to sort them. Dining hall had bad hours. I saw 4 cockroaches in 2 years: 1 in my bathroom, and 3 while on duty. And there is no kitchen. Probably some more. But I only have fond memories.. . --------------------. . South Quad:. Overall - 5,. Cleanliness - 4.5,. Location - 5,. Community - 4. . South Quad is where the athletes and LSA honors students tend to live. It's right next to campus and is very close to downtown. Rooms don't have AC, but it's honestly not that bad. Just get a fan and open some windows. The bathrooms look fancy and clean (not as fancy and clean as Alice imo). And are cleaned very frequently. There's a bus stop right outside. And South Quad (Squad) has its own dining hall.. . Pros: great Community. You can go to honors events to meet tons of students, you're close to downtown and campus as well as have easy access to a bus stop. Bathrooms are clean. There are tons of places to study. And it has a kitchen. You can go to the 9th floor and get pretty cool view of the city, too.. . Cons: the RAs are pretty strict there (idk why, but all the ones I spoke to were power tripping like mad). Laundry was a bit of a struggle due to there not being enough washers and dryers per hall.. . --------------------. . Bursley:. Overall - 3,. Cleanliness - 3,. Location - 2,. Community - 5 (almost a 6 as well). . I had a bunch of friends who lived in Bursely. They usually visited me in my dorm and spent the night there. That's because the busses stop running at 2am. Also because it's hard to get food after 10pm on north campus. The bathrooms were kinda funky and the lighting everywhere was dingy. Luckily you get a dining hall and a nice campus store. You're walking distance to north and there is a bus stop right outside to take you to central. Living on north makes club activities hard, but luckily you'll be able to make tons of friends with everyone else in your dorm.. . Pros: dining hall, good Community, close to north, lots of nature, Plymouth road restaurants, campus store.. . Cons: it's on north, busses stop at 2am so you have to be back by then. Showers were bad.. . --------------------. . Basically. You'll be fine wherever you live. North campus sucks because it's so far away, but because you're stuck up there with everyone else, you make tons of friends. Living on the hill was my favorite place to be as a student as it was a short bus ride to north and still had good access to central. I highly reccomend living in a double. I find every triple or larger will have an issue. And if you're not excited about cleaning a bathroom, then you probably don't want a private one as you'll end up sharing with a roommate and you'll both have to clean it (looking at you bursley). I don't know much about your MLC--sorry. Even for an engineering student, I think living on central/Hill is the best due to how accessible downtown, clubs, friends, and campus are. Also, I think the most important parts of freshman year are building a social network, learning how to be independent, and learning how to be a college student. For those reasons, I think Community (from my above rankings) is very important. Most people eventually realize that having friends is like having a cheat code for college.. .

t1_i2jijbv,2022-03-29 08:41:31,t1_i2iae7h,t3_tq0wch,"Hi professor Juett.. . I have a suggestion/personal experience that may be relevant. . . As many people in the EECS department know, a huge issue for the surge in OH queue time near the project due date is due to students starting the projects late. While I agree and understand that it's not the course staffs responsibility to get students to start the projects on time, I belive there are additional ways to encourage students to start earlier. Currently, most professors just announce, ""the new project is up. Feel free to begin whenever."" I have found that myself, as well as many of my classmates and friends completely ignore this message and start the project about a week before its due (and then stress every day because it's a lot of work to do in a week lol).. . I know that my friends and I who start projects late do this because of the ""inertia"" that a project has. Sitting down to download the starter files and set up your ide/file structure/debugger/whatever else takes a lot of energy--more energy than just sitting down and coding. I have found that if I download starter files the day they are released, I'm am infinitely more likely to start the project more than a week before the deadline. . . My proposal has a few parts:. . 1.) I belive that labs that are on the week that a project is assigned should also require an autograder submit of the project. It can be a submit with just the starter files downloaded or anything more than that. This means that there should be an extra submission allowed for each student on/until their lab.. . 2.) Students who score a 15% (or some value low enough that it is easily attainable, but still requires effort) on the autograder within a week of the project being released should be allotted 2 (or however many the course staff decides) extra submits total to be used throughout the duration od that specific project. Thats not to say 2 extra submits per day, but rather 2 submits thay can be used whenever during thay projects duration.. . 3.) This is my least favorite idea as it feels unfair. But I believe there should be some metrics for OH queues that prioritizes students who submitted by the deadline from my first point. Thay way students are even more incentivised to download the starter files early. I agree this idea is harsh, so Im not convinced it's good or is needed.. . -------------------. . To summarize:. . I believe that getting students to download the starter files and setup their environment sooner will result in students actually working on the project earlier. I proposed 3 steps to help facilitate this change: 1, make students submit the starter files during lab; 2, give bonus submissions to students who reach a predetermined score; and 3, give OH priority to students who did their first submission during lab.",5.0,error,0.0

Do your best to mention specific details to express you know the shit out of the readings and didn't just skim.. . **\[Procrastination Textwall\]**. . No. Was a grader for 110 and an IA for another SI course. In most courses you just show up, do the baseline amount of work, and stroll through with an A- or an A.. . That said, SI's main prereqs are basically structured with specific intention:. . * SI 106: Ensure admits can actually code at some basic level. * SI 110: Ensure admits can tolerate social-sciences & can digest and engage with socio-technical ideas effectively. * English 125: Ensure admits can communicate effectively. * SI 110's grading scheme unintentionally started to fall back on the communication-quality aspect captured by English 125, whoops. * Stats 250: Ensure admits can at least follow along basic statistical outputs they may see in the data-analysis courses or essays about A-B tests if they're in UX. . But what you'll actually do once you get in is pretty much focused towards either UX or data analysis & programming. Some courses will have you do a bit of reading and writing but it was almost never as heavy as 110. I did have one Online Communities course that was similar, but not as high-volume as 110 was.. . So, ultimately, don't let 110 discourage you, as it's less about ""hey this is SI"" and more about vetting you as an admit and making sure that when you enter SI you have a baseline idea of some of the technical cultural shit your profs will mention down the line in further courses.. . **My experience as a grader for 110:**. . * The professor'd give me a rubric. * I'd go through the rubric for each submission and go ""groovy these are mostly like A-'s aside from some people that super clearly skimmed shit or didn't read at all"". * Then the professor'd go ""hey I need you to impose a curve of sorts, they can't all be A's"". * Then I'd go back and revise, but most people were meeting what seemed to be fairly A- level material. * But alright, guess I have to *find* reasons to pull people down in a *relative* sense. * Then I'd come back and they'd go ""okay great but you need to give *constructive* feedback that tries to explain your grading, and also make it kinda actionable so they can improve"". * ""Improve?

How doable this schedule is depends on how comfortable you are with the content in these classes.. . I had previous experience studying DS&A and practicing through leetcode, so 281 wasn't as bad due to that, since I have a rough understanding of most of the content so I just skim through AJ Zhou's notes before the exams instead of following along with lectures every week ([https://ajzhou.gitlab.io/eecs281/notes/](https://ajzhou.gitlab.io/eecs281/notes/) these are goated).. . I also don't watch lectures for 376, but instead, just skim through the notes ([https://eecs376.github.io/notes/](https://eecs376.github.io/notes/)) to be able to do weekly homework, and then go through them again before exams. This class I had no background knowledge for (except a little bit with the greedy / DP portion at the beginning, again from leetcode and DS&A), so its a lot more of a grind. Be sure to look at the weekly discussion notes and worksheets, since a lot of the homework problems are slight variations of discussion problems.. . For 370, I'm kind of forced to watch the lectures since there's no good notes (generally prefer reading notes over watching lectures since its easier to go through more content a lot faster for me). The projects aren't too bad, 10-15 hours/project is a generous estimate if you are fairly comfortable with coding in C but don't keep up with the lecture content (I just crammed them in before a project / homework is due or an exam was coming up), should take less time if you do keep up with lectures though. This semester I noticed that the project deadlines didn't line up with 281 deadlines except for maybe one part of one project, so that's hopefully the case for future semesters. The biweekly homework actually takes pretty long as well if you haven't watched the lectures, so set aside maybe a half a day to a day for that.. . Math 451 is a lot lighter than Math 217 in terms of workload (maybe like 5-6 hours per homework), 412 might be a bit more work (haven't taken it, so not sure), but even then it's probably a lot lighter than 217.. . Even with this schedule, I can sleep like 10 hours/day if I want to and have a few hours of free time a day. It's good to get other people's suggestions, but in the end you know best how comfortable you are with the stuff covered in these classes and how fast you learn / work, so the same schedule may take vastly different times for different people.. . I will add that I wouldn't take that schedule in the fall. Take a lighter load and instead spend the remaining time on recruiting season for an internship for Summer 2023. Sending out applications, doing online assessments and phone interviews, grinding leetcode, etc. becomes a massive grind, and doing that schedule will take away from the time you can spend on recruiting instead, which imo is a lot more important. You can start taking ULCS with only 281, and if you want to take 482, then pair it with 370. 376 only unlocks EECS 477, and Math 412 you can probably take in a later semester as well.. . I would also tell you to think about taking a lighter schedule so you have more time to do fun stuff, and not just grind for classes or internships all day, but there are probably better people to tell you that in the comments :)",12.0,error,0.0

If you don't use any of the University amenities or free things, of course you wouldn't want this, but then why go to a physical school anyway when you could get an online degree at less cost? It's all additional overhead cost -- student life, on-campus speakers, libraries, sidewalks, museums, club sports. And there is an efficiency to buying things in bulk or negotiating on behalf of all students/clubs, so it's a net positive value add.. . My question is why does the University push this through the CSG when they already charge so much tuition? Do students really get any ability to influence the budgets because of the CSG?

You may have more coding experience from somewhere other than just 280, which some students do by this point in their degree. For me I took 281 a year after 280 (CE major so 281 is totally optional and only a prereq for some upper levels) and I did so much coding in between the two that I find it relatively a lot easier than 280 was just because of the discrepancy between where I was and where I am now.. . Basically I'm saying judge for yourself and trust your gut where you think you are. We have this thing in EECS, especially on reddit, of ignoring the how much difficulty varies student to student, and these rate my schedule posts are very common and useful, but I think can lead to some questionable advice. Yes I think you should obviously know the reputation and relative difficulty of classes you sign up for, but some people take 4 EECS at once and ace them all, some people take one at a time and still fail, I've seen both extremes happen to people and only you know where you fall on that spectrum.",4.0,neutral,0.6927220821380615

An A- is absolutely, positively not going to be a reason why you can't get an internship, especially given that most hiring managers probably hated discrete math just like most students. *Most* students find it's difficult to get an internship the first couple of summers and the reason has basically nothing to do with their grades.

The second thing is you are no longer a child. While you lived in your parents' home, you were a child and you needed to do what they asked and keep them satisfied. Now, you're out of their house. Welcome to being an adult (or at least, transitioning to the one you're becoming.) The rest of your life is up to you, not your parents. Sometimes, they may not agree with your choices or your outcomes. But they had their chance to live their lives and make their choices and now it is your turn.. . You'll of course need to be respectful in how you respond to their (completely unfounded!) concern that an A- is the end of the world, but your grade is what it is and it's a very good grade. It's also not even their business anymore. (Under FERPA, your grades are secret and the university doesn't share them with your parents. They only know you got an A- because you must have told them.)",133.0,positive,0.596671998500824

By that I mean it has the most required courses since it gears students towards obtaining a Ph.D. in chemistry or being heavily equipped to enter industry. It's also a unique degree since it requires that you join a research lab (and you get credit for it via CHEM 399). If you still want a chemistry major but want less stringent requirements (or a biological focus), there are other variations available to you (Biochemistry, Biomolecular Sciences, Chemical Sciences, and Interdisciplinary Chemical Sciences). . . Course-work-wise, you take the normal gauntlet of organic, inorganic, analytical, and physical but you also get some room to take some electives whether its biochemistry, physical organic, polymer chemistry, or the myriad of courses available. Some of the specialized courses that the major requires are classes such as CHEM 447 (Physical Methods of Analysis) and CHEM 483 (Advanced Methods in Physical Analysis) really gear you towards being able to understand analytical instrumentation. CHEM 482 (Synthesis) is a lab course that combines organic, inorganic, and organometallic chemistry and gives you a good introduction into the world of synthetic chemistry (but also satisfies the upper-level writing requirement or ULWR). If you've already found your niche of chemistry by your junior year and plan on going to graduate school, you can take the graduate courses in the field you'd like to specialize in (and it counts as your advanced lecture credit). . . Research opportunities are far and wide at this school. For CHEM 399 (the required research credit course) you can do research in the department of chemistry or outside the department (with the caveat that the research has to be chemistry related).

For noon games we usually start the day at 6:30am and end around 5:00pm. Night games start around 3:00pm and end a bit past midnight. . . Since it's such a big band (400+) we have challenges every show cycle to determine who matches in half time and pregame. These are based on marching ability with a tie breaker being chair placement (chair challenges happen during band week).

I went to one of those schools you got rejected from for undergrad, and now I am a professor at UM. That Ivy League school (ILS) I went to is ranked several spots higher than UM, but the *department* I'm in here is ranked **48 spots** higher than the same department in the supposedly much better university. Admittedly that is technically the graduate programs, but they are not disconnected--we all do research and teach, and if you come here you can work with us in our labs, or whatever we do. There is no doubt that I met some of the most creative and smart people in my life at that ILS, but I've had the great fortune to interact with, teach and mentor just as amazing students at UM! The students here have been inspiring, hard-working, respectful, and overall the one thing that always gets me out of bed in the morning. The rankings cannot measure that. The UM alumni network is one of the greatest resources this school has, and anywhere you go (even Europe) people will say ""Go Blue"" when they see the block M. It is impossible to appreciate the sense of family until you have experienced it firsthand. Also, as someone who has spent a good amount of time at European institutes, I can say that most Europeans would be utterly blown away by the infrastructure we have at almost any American University.

There were maybe times I wished I was at a smaller school, but these pale in comparison to the number of times I felt fortunate to be attending such a diverse school. . . 2. No, in fact the University has events all the time like UMix, bagel Wednesday, and pep rallies etc which are designed to be alcohol-free social gatherings. I had a few friends who didn't drink/party too hard and they had a fulfilling social life at UM as well. Worst thing is you might get a lil bored hanging out at a tailgate with a bunch of drunks, but no one will bother or make fun of you. . . 3. No, but I was an in-state student who had grades just good enough to get into UM, but not good enough to get into anywhere better and didn't have the funds to pay for private school tuition. UM was my best acceptance. I also feel that my four years at Michigan prepared me academically, socially, and professionally for the real world. The sink or swim mentality that I feared as a freshman prepared me to succeed in the real world. . . 4. Tbh most beef I had with UM was tied to it being an elite large state school - can be too big at times, so tougher to form bonds with professors/GSIs, super competitive student body so grade curves were pretty nuts at times and peers can be cutthroat at times. Also not a fan of the whole work hard/play hard mentality. Should note that none of these are really UM specific, and I'm sure apply to other schools of similar size/academic profile. . . 5. Ummm I never felt unsafe on campus, but I am a 6'3"" man. Campus has its own PD, academic buildings and dorms need valid student ID for entry. Most security alerts I recall getting were for car break-ins and street muggings on weekend nights, but I don't recall many that happened at gun/knifepoint. There were unfortunately also the occasional report of sexual harassment/assault as well. I'd look at Ann Arbor crime statistics for further detail.. . 6. I'm old so I don't recall the pre-orientation events. But I don't recall any disastrous advice being given and was overall positive on the experience. . . 7. I thought the dorms were fine. When I was in school, they were being renovated one by one and I remember thinking they had done a good job with each renovation project. They were overall pretty standard. If you're LSA try and get Central Campus, engineering North may be helpful. Central does have all the party culture so North may actually be better in your situation, if you don't mind taking the shuttle to central. Bursley is the all freshman dorm in north.",3.0,error,0.0

t1_i31ve02,2022-04-02 00:20:50,t3_ttwt2n,t3_ttwt2n,"Freshman majoring in CS -- . . 1. It was definitely a big change (my high school had only \~800 ppl total), but I really like it! Being part of such a large group is really nice, especially when you see Michigan popping up literally everywhere. It also creates a sense of freedom, since there's always someone new to meet and you can't really know everyone. If you're afraid of not being able to make friends, I'd recommend joining a learning community -- that can definitely help. If not, you'll probably still naturally make friends with people in your dorm. . 2. There are definitely parties available if you want to go, but I don't think we're a big party school at all in that it's required / there's pressure to do it. I know plenty of people who don't drink at all, and the majority of my friends don't party. This isn't something I would worry about at all, you'll be fine :). 3. Nope! I love it here. I was initially afraid that it would be worse than smaller private schools I could have chosen because it would be under-resourced like a lot of big publics, but that's not true at all -- it feels like a private school in its resources. Plus, I think our culture + academics really help bring the community together, which is really nice. . 4. I think for sure it can be a bit isolating because of the size (as you mentioned), but you just have to try a bit harder to make friends and it's definitely an experience worth having just to go a bit out of your comfort zone -- you have to remember that everyone is in the same boat. Also, the weather is kinda ass, but you do learn to appreciate the sun more and take advantage of it in the rare times you see it . 5. Yes 100% I think Ann Arbor is one of the safest places I've ever lived. The areas where you'll be is literally designed for university students, and I don't really have to worry at all. I (and many other people) often leave my stuff in common study areas in my dorm just because its that safe. 6. idk, didn't do any of those. 7.

t1_i321cf8,2022-04-02 01:11:02,t3_ttwt2n,t3_ttwt2n,"For context, I'm a female, senior studying public policy through the Ford School. . 1. I'm introverted too and I was nervous about going to a big school (my mom wanted me to go to a small, private school) but I love it!!!! There's so many opportunities and so many different people to meet so I never feel tied down to one specific clique. I have friends from class and clubs. Plus, before college, I struggled a lot with social anxiety but coming to a big school I was kinda thrown into the deep end (having to make phone calls, meeting with professors, ordering food, engaging in small talk...) which was so scary at first but I'm so grateful bc my social anxiety is so much better and I'm able to do so many social things I wasn't able to do before college. I have never wished I went to a smaller school, now the thought of going to a smaller school kinda scares me lol I feel like I would feel trapped . 2. I'm not a partier and I don't drink. I have some friends that do and I sometimes go out with them (if I want to) but I never feel pressured or made fun of by them. However, I'm also in greek life and the partying is a big deal there. I met a couple friends through my sorority and now I'm pretty uninvolved. From my experience, it depends who you hang out with but I haven't felt pressured outside of Greek Life. There's other social stuff to do, student orgs, movie nights, going out to dinner, sports games.... . 3. Nope don't regret it. I did feel a little overwhelmed freshman year but once I felt like I found my place it was all good. I really recommend joining clubs and/or trying to get into a specific college or program (like Ross, Ford, Public Health, Engineering, org studies...) to try and make the big school feel small. . 4. I sometimes don't like the ""sink or swim"" mentality. Umich isn't going to help you remember deadlines or find opportunities or get internships or reach out to help you with assignments. You have to stay on top of everything and reach out for help yourself if you need it. Professors and administrators aren't just going to reach out to help you which can sometimes feel like there's a lot of pressure to grow up really fast. It feels more like the real world, not like a gentle, nurturing school. Its made me very independent and proactive but its kinda scary sometimes. Lastly, the partying aspect (but again, I feel like you can really avoid that if you aren't in greek life). . 5. I've never felt unsafe, I walk home alone at night all the time (and I live off campus). There are some homeless people around Ann Arbor that sometimes try and talk to me but I've generally found them pretty harmless. There's also a blue light system and I often see campus police driving around, just keeping an eye on the students. . 6. I just did the general orientation that most people go to. It was ok, the Q&A panels were helpful. But I feel like you get the best sense of the school once you're actually on campus as a student. Orientation doesn't really give the full picture of what its like to be a student. . 7. Obviously, people hate north campus if their major isn't on north (not gonna sugar coat it haha). If you wanna guarantee that you'll live in a central campus dorm, apply to a learning community like the Honors Program (I was in it and got to live in South Quad and it also really helped make the big school feel small). .

It's nice in that u can meet new people but I guess that it can make it hard to kind of reinforce or strengthen relationships. It's just what you make of it. The high school I went to was about half as large as yours but the transition still did feel pretty natural. I'm used to walking around the halls and not knowing anyone lol.. 2. I'm not a partier and I've never felt pressured to go to a party. It's probably just gonna be based off of who you're friends with. None of my friends party and we always find plenty of things to do.

There's nothing that I particularly don't like about the school. Maybe just that they're a little too harsh when it comes to grading at times (that's not really specific to the school though lol). A lot of the current issues I face I'd probably encounter at any college. However, I do have quite a few issues with my dorm lol.. 5. Generally, I feel pretty safe on campus. I definitely feel safe when I'm with other people, but I often don't feel safe when I'm alone at night (I'm a girl). . 6. I had online orientation so I really can't say what's best.. 7. I was lucky enough to land a central campus dorm and my dorm is really nice. That being said, I got stuck in a hall full of partiers who like to scream and slam their doors at 3am.

You just need to know basic cell biology that you probably learned in high school (or can easily look up online). If you took AP bio in high school you're probably fine.. . The profs did a good job in covering/reviewing material, so as long as you're on top of lectures and making sure to ask questions when you're confused, you should be all set. It is an intro microbio class so it isn't designed to be that difficult, it's mostly to teach you the basics.. . You already mentioned this, but Bio 171/172 and 173 are enforced prereqs so you do have to take them before Bio 207, at least that's my understanding.

For comparison I have a studio apartment in Northwood for $975/month on a 12 month lease: no meal plan, in a worse building, and much worse location. (Still university housing though, so that gives you a rough lower bound of fair-value for an apartment unless you go far off campus or are willing to share a bedroom.) As someone else mentioned you could live in Munger for $1000/month and save some money if you cook for yourself, but Munger has mixed reviews since the bedrooms have no windows and you have to share common areas with 6 or 7 other people.. . Finding a fall sublet is going to suck unless you're willing to take anything you can get -- there isn't much supply.

I can't speak for Lyman Briggs, but as someone in LSA Honors, it makes like 0 difference, other than a few small perks here and there. And onto the main topic, B) I ended up choosing UM because I felt like there was a higher caliber of learning. I had really wanted to do research, and I found a lot of the chem department and Michigan Medicine research to be really cool. And tbh I thought I might make friends that I would vibe with better at UM - I've met a lot of really smart, driven students here (definitely not saying that people at MSU are not like this, but that's what was going through my head when I was deciding two years ago). Finally, I thought the courses might be more rigorous at UM, which I actually wanted.. . I know a lot of people here are saying it's foolish to give up a full ride to a good school (and maybe it is), but I really felt that it was worth it to try and be in the best environment for me to work towards my goals.. . Keep in mind, you could even try MSU for a year and transfer into UM if you don't like it there! Also, try to talk to someone from both universities.

Your primary care doc can provide much faster turnaround on referrals and such as well. . .

UHS sees many students just trying to score adderall, they don't deal with it (and I can't blame them). . . Primary care doctors are your best bet, but understand they are all different. Some less-scrupulous primary care docs may see your past history and ask you a few questions, others may require neurological confirmation (which I don't recommend as a first step due to the time and cost if you're already struggling) or referral to a psychiatrist. I would recommend working with a psychiatrist as they have a foot in the behavioral and medical disciplines. . .

Similarly parking fees can't be in line with retirement unless you're looking at something like the Gold pass (which is designed for people like physicians and department chairs who have to travel to appointments or meetings at different campus locations). BTW plenty of faculty and staff just don't buy a parking pass: you can always bus/bike/walk/rideshare/hunt for free parking. . .

I gather based on the fact that you have a family and are comparing insurance options for the first time that you are probably new to the US (welcome!)

The only way to get into a dorm for certain is to apply for whatever learning communities live there (honors, MRADS, WISE stuff like that). However this also has the drawback of forcing you into that living community, meaning you have to take a certain class or comply with certain requirements. . . . Just to drive the point home, I'll reiterate that which dorm you get is pretty unimportant. You can still see your friends in other dorms, and it's not a terrible commute from north to central if you get a north campus dorm. You can still eat at whichever dining hall you want and it's overall not that big of a difference, and absolutely not worth stressing over.",16.0,neutral,0.7079361081123352

Atleast in terms of Effort to Reward ratio. Sure if you've got time it might help but it's not particularly efficient. . . My advice is . 1. Quickly find a group of people to work on the HW with weekly (this helped me immensely) working with others helps you get over hard problems quicker and finish the HW faster . . 2. Use the Mathlab and office hours religiously. I was in the Mathlab pretty much daily and some with OH. These two places will minimize the effort you have to put in and help you learn the most. . . 3. Follow what they tell you on the syllabus, do the webwork and the readings the second they come out. Do as much of the homework as you possibly can over the weekend so you have time to go to OH with meaningful questions for the HW and course content. . Do NOT procrastinate.. . 4. If you have a good background in proofs then this doesn't apply, but if you're new to mathematical writing then you really MUST take math 201.. . The course tells you that a course objective is to learn how to write proofs which might lead you to believe that you will be taught how to write proofs within 217. This is simply not the case. I was never taught a single proof method. Instead the course assumes you can write proofs and you will have a lot of practice writing proofs throughout the course. If you have background with proof writing then you will be ok. If not TAKE MATH 201. . . I think that's pretty much all my advice. Everything above is something I've done and I went from doing ok in the class to doing really well now. I had a great time in 217 and while I found it hard, I think it helped me develop my critical thinking and problem solving skills. If you make good use of your time the course is really not so bad and you'll learn a lot. Also the instructors for 217 are great.

Moreover, try understanding and memorizing all HW results (Do go to OH if you really have a hard time figuring a problem out, for me it was one direction of a part B problem, whose formal proof utilized several previous HW results and took an entire page).. .

I don't think ""some"" is an entirely accurate descriptor.... . >They always will. . That's just defeatist . . >Some people don't like short people, bald people, or gingers too.. . This is a very very narrow understanding of the type of hate involved in the hate that black people experience. Like... I am not saying those groups aren't oppressed or that people don't have misconceptions or that they don't underestimate someone based on those attributes. But. Thats so incredibly different than the fact that there are groups who believe that black people should be sectioned off in a different part of the country than them, at best....and genocided away, at worst. Find me an anti bald group that plots to kill people because they didn't grow enough hair.. . >Telling black people that they can't succeed because they are black just creates an easy scapegoat and societal incohesion.. . We don't have to tell black people they can't succeed because they're black, we prove it to them every day by ignoring lead in the water in the communities they live in. By basing school funding on property values after systematically ensuring they couldn't get property in wealthy areas for decades. By destroying their financial districts and not even talking about it. By grilling them about cases related to pedophilia that they judged during their questioning before they can join the Supreme Court. By drawing political voting districts and creating voting laws that intentionally make it more difficult for them to vote *and* giving them less power when they do. By treating their medical complaints as no big deal that would otherwise be considered concerning in white people and ultimately giving them worse health outcomes. By giving them harsher prison sentences than white counterparts. By paying them less than their non-black counterparts.. . Institutions make being black harder every step of the way. No one is telling them they can't succeed theyre making *sure* they can't succeed.. . >Race is a distraction from class issues and making meaningful change.. . Well I mean that's true, MLK agreed. He tried to convince the working class to work together to overcome wage oppression. He felt that by focusing on race, working class Americans were working against their own self-nterest against these ultra-wealthy people and corporations.. . But like. That doesn't mean that institutional racism isn't a problem. It is a very very big problem. The solution is not to ignore the problems of racism. Non-black (and non-hispanics, while we're at it, since Hispanics are also at a huge disadvantage) people should learn about intersectionality and realize that, no-- oppression against black people doesn't affect them, but if they worked together with black people to remove the institutional racism and oppression that exists, its ultimately better for everyone because then everyone can collectively work towards improving workers right and take down the ultra wealthy. . Why should we focus on institutional racism first? Well because the institutional racism keeps us divided so that while some of us are squabbling over whether white or black people have it worse, others are trying to improve working standards and wage for the working class. But if we work on the institutional racism first, then we can all be working together to work on the working class rights.",-6.0,error,0.0

t1_i49v82k,2022-04-11 09:37:38,t3_u0rtj5,t3_u0rtj5,"I think this *totally* depends on what your lifestyle/reality is in Boston, where I'm also from. I moved to Ann Arbor from a financially stable East Coast young, professional background and I wouldn't have been able to keep a similar lifestyle here for three years without a car. With a car, I can take advantage of the nightlife and culture in Detroit whenever I want (huge techno fan), I go to lake Michigan when I need a break, I went snowboarding all winter, I can head to all the farms in Ann Arbor which are not accessible any other way. Just imagine being totally bound to the busses and T with no car, but then imagine only the Green Line and downtown busses exist, and that's what relying on public transport in A2 is like. Because I'm from Eastern Massachusetts, I could never imagine my life being so limited, or not heading to the Cape or to Blue Hills when I feel like it, so again it's just about your perspective.. . There are reasons why I stayed in the area. Nature is gorgeous and I fell into the agricultural community. The cost of living compared to salary is pretty much amazing everywhere except maybe Ann Arbor itself and other wealthy towns to the north. I was shocked to find near-Boston like rent prices for shitty units in Ann Arbor, so I moved next door to Ypsi and bought a house with some land now I'm even closer to Detroit. I'm at the end of my three year program, and I'm testing out running a small business here which would be absolutely impossible at home. The LLC paperwork was 50 bucks. At home it would have been $500. Land was half the cost. . . The University of Michigan is diverse. Ann Arbor itself is not a culturally diverse place, comparatively, and you will run into more people who have less cultural competency in cultures other than white Midwestern culture, even if they mean well there is simply less exposure here. The University of Michigan had more sexual assault/harassment cases campus-wide and in my department itself than any other school I've been to and this is my fourth school. I think people confuse their time experiences at the University with what it's like to live in michigan. As soon as you leave the UM campus and downtown Ann arbor, life is really different here than at home, even though the door to door trip with air travel is like only 3 hours. . . We're from one of the most expensive parts of the country for a reason. I think you realize how amazing the quality of life is in Eastern Massachusetts when you leave it for the first time. People are smarter at home, things tend to run a little smoother in general, and this East Coaster finds ""Midwest Nice"" to be the most childish, empty, and condescending waste of my breathing power. I communicate clearly and directly, and I don't have patience for adults who don't. I find the lengthy small talk here to be incredibly disrespectful because I have yet to find somebody who will actually listen when you try to talk back. There will be a line out the door and the clerk and a customer will be engaged in the most inane small talk and neither are actually listening to each other. It's not cute to me.. . I don't think I could stay here super long term, but it's definitely fitting my needs now. Although Boston is an incredibly well-run City, in SE MI, things being less expensive, there being less people, and there being more space, make some aspects of life's day to day a little bit less hectic here. You could literally have a successful night out for under $50 bucks including gas money. The first time I went to a techno party in Detroit we just left our cars in a field and there was no parking to pay for and the venue cost was $15 and drinks were like seven bucks and strong, and the DJs were the most legit. i turned to the guy i was with and was like, there are no rules here and I am never going home haha. I would have gone bonkers if my life was just limited to downtown Ann Arbor and the campus, but I also lived here during the pandemic mostly.. . Tl;dr- The East Coast is expensive and desirable for a reason and people who spend most of their time at UM on campus or in downtown A2 will have a completely different experience than people who are trying to acclimate to a life in southeast Michigan generally.",1.0,error,0.0

You're off to a good start if you're going to be practicing Leetcode since a lot of companies use similar questions to those in their interviews. . . . .

The first is that you have a good chance of applying to a lot of companies and either not hearing back/getting rejected.

So while it can be demotivating, it's something that a lot of people will go through so try not to feel too bad about it if it happens to you. The other thing which will help with the previous tip is that when you go to the career fair, do a bit of research beforehand on the role. Even 5 min of prep will set you apart from other people. Try not to ask about the company in general like ""oh what do you guys do at X company"" but rather stuff about the role itself like ""I'm applying for X position and I was wondering about Y and Z aspects of the job."". .
