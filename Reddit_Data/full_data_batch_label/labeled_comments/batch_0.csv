Earth and Environmental Sciences (Earth) is more science intensive than PitE. You can chose to focus on either more hard-geology stuff, or more environmental stuff, or mix and match between the two. Some courses I've taken include Environmental Geochemistry, Applied Geophysics, Sediments, and Geobiology. There are also lots of great research opportunities for undergrads within the department, if you are curious please message me and I'll give you some thoughts! It's a great major to understand both the science behind geologic and environmental processes, as well as how the environment reacts to climate change, pollution, etc. . . Program in the Environment (PitE) is more interdisciplinary. There are not as many science and math prereqs, and there are more social science and humanities classes within the major. You can get a BA or a BS, but to get the BS you will have to make an effort to take extra science courses beyond the requirement to get up to the 60 credits of NS credit needed for a BS. It's also on the whole a much larger program than Earth, with a lot more students. It does also have a bit more flexibility. If you want to take a class on Native American literature, that counts towards the major. So does a course about the history of the US West. There are tons of ways to complete the PitE major and you have much more flexibility to choose exactly what interests you.. . Neither program is super intensive, to be honest. There are many, many people who either double major or major in one and minor in the other. I'm obviously biased towards the Earth department, so I won't bother pitching it to you, but it does matter what you plan to do. Law school? Maybe the humanities and social sciences of PitE will be more helpful. Research/academia? That's a tough road to walk, but I'd say that the Earth dept is much more focused on research than PitE. . .

Anyone is welcome to our events, such as our weekly Hack Nights (Thursdays, 7-10 in EECS 1005). However, for a more rewarding experience, we also have core team membership for students who demonstrate passion through attendance and effort (you would receive an email application in such case). Active core team member benefits include being added to our site roster (tentatively) and our resume book.. . Experienced students can find leadership positions as a core team lead or executive member, gain project experience (through working old ones or creating new ones), guide younger students, or show off their skills through tech talks. For beginners, we also have an entire dedicated team for newbies who want to learn the basics. We're being super ambitious this year in particular, so fingers crossed!. .

I wrote down some things I think you need to hear in order to get past these feelings.. . First, you need to understand your perception of this reality in which everyone but you is having the time of their lives isn't accurate. You've had difficulty with loneliness before and had high expectations of what college would be like. When things didn't immediately fall into place, you got disheartened and every person you saw having fun became further evidence of what you were missing out on. It's textbook confirmation bias - like Danyol said above, you don't see the hundreds of kids who are going through the same thing as you. I would add that even the kids you see having the time of their lives are probably dealing with many issues of their own and might not even be enjoying themselves that much. Many kids drink and party because it's what their friends do and not because they enjoy it. Just know, you aren't the only one experiencing these feelings.. . Second, it seems like you are chasing the things you think will get you friends, whether that be parties or football games or whatever. Do you actually like and enjoy those things? It is okay if you don't, and many kids on campus have great friend groups without doing any of those things. You have to get over the FOMO of not going to all these parties.. . Third, it seems like you are really focused on getting a girlfriend and having success with women. I have a lot of friends with similar worries and believe me, the more you chase, the less likely it is you will find anyone. Don't waste time on tinder or money on tinder gold - it isn't worth the trouble. You could get lucky and meet someone, or more likely you could spend hours and swipe through hundreds and not meet anyone worthwhile. Most of the people I know with the app just have it for fun to swipe through people on the weekends and all of the best relationships I have seen formed through other (not online) means. Focus on yourself, focus on school, and focus on finding good people to be friends with. Trust me that a girlfriend will follow. . . Finally, I've read through some of your posts and I think I have an idea of who you are and what you are experiencing. You haven't been dealt a fair hand with your looks and its affected your friendships and success with women. It seems like you worked out a lot to try to turn it around and U of M was supposed to be different from your home. I want to caution you against bitterness and blaming others/women for where you're at. The path before you diverges based on whether you choose to let go of that bitterness or keep it. The road where you let it go leads to a happier life and a better place where you feel a sense of belonging. The road where you keep it doesn't. I understand its hard and that loneliness is a terrible feeling, and I also get that it isn't fair that you have to go through this when others who got lucky with their genes don't, but this is your life, you don't get another one, and you get to control what happens. . .

Groups that force social interaction in their activities.

If you're having trouble talking to people clubs are the easiest way in.. .

t1_e5q9iz0,2018-09-10 16:00:18,t3_9edw36,t3_9edw36,"Bro. As a fellow member of this community, welcome. It might be larger here than expected, but that just makes the work & social stuff take more effort, and both are more rewarding for it. The juice is definitely worth the squeeze, or at least it has been for me. . . . (Be forewarned, I tend to slip into speaking in proverbs & cliches. I use them only because I have found them to be mostly true.). . . . I am a professional advice giver to first-year students on campus. I want to offer you some sincere advice, based on your post history. I hope it helps, but even if you don't listen to it, at least it was free, right? . . . . Meat space relationships are not zero-sum games. That's paradoxically both the frustrating AND the beautiful part of them. I am a gamer, too. It is tempting to look at personal interactions as buttons that can be pressed to your benefit. It would be so simple, were it true. The wonderful thing about personal interactions, though, is that they can be +EV for \*both parties.\* . . . Professional relationship? Someone with whom you might like to study/work/collaborate/do business? They want to know one thing, ultimately: What's in it for them? Synonymously: What can you offer? . . . Romantic interest? Same thing. You suspect you know what YOU can get out of a partnership (life-long, or just for the night), but what can THEY get out of it? It is your job to let them know, and the subtle part about dating is that oftentimes much of the early ""language"" is non-verbal flirting. Social media (facebook, snap, tinder et al.) are horrible platforms for flirting. . . . Potential friendship? Again, see the above theme. Not everyone will make a great friend for you, nor will you make a great friend for everyone. The best part about living in such a large community of people your age is that even a small subset of the larger population is still a relatively big number of potential friends. It's your job to talk to them and find out.. . . . Advice, in no particular order:. . . 1) You seem like a thoughtful, energetic, enthusiastic learner. This is great. Interests (things in common) are a strong base for launching a friendship. But interests are not enough. You also have to be INTERESTING. Showing genuine interest in someone is a great way to be interesting yourself. Proverb: Interested people are interesting. Only boring people are bored.. . . . 2) Balance. It's awesome that you read 7 poker books and are now a winning player. Not everyone can do that, that's interesting! Same thing on your gym routine-- that kind of lifting and diet regimen take serious discipline! That is awesome! Now be cautious not to overdo it, especially when first meeting someone. Have other topics of conversation about which you are a) knowledgable, and/or b) can ask interesting questions. Be humble about your accomplishments. Where you've been is only as important as where it can take you next. To use a poker analogy: I don't care about the last hand I played. I care about playing the next one better. Lifting analogy more your preference? Shit, I hit a PR yesterday. So what? Where will I be next month? . . . . 3) People whom we have just met can SMELL desperation. It's a primate thing. Don't be in such a hurry, especially when it comes to early romantic interactions. Enjoy getting to know someone. . If you really are a match, then there will be a second date (and a 3rd, 4th, &c.), so what's the rush? If the two of you aren't a match, then neither of you will waste any more time/energy (i.e no 2nd date needed, you folded pre-flop). The most rewarding romances (physically & emotionally) are built TOGETHER on mutual trust. This cannot happen quickly, by definition.. . . . 4) Stay away from The Red Pill nonsense. That stuff is misguided at best, and violently misogynistic at worst. It's not a cheat code for doing well with women. It's hogwash. I believe that we have to learn to love ourselves in order to have others love us (corny, but true...). Now, I'm not saying you should change who are for someone else. And definitely don't push your agenda on someone who is ultimately not interested. Both are wastes of your time and theirs, and recipes for unhappiness.. . . . 5) Continue improving yourself. Don't be satisfied with where you are. Progress. Learn. Be the best version of yourself you can be. Expect nothing. Blame no one. Do something.",4.0,error,0.0

Additionally, I have the Smart Keyboard with the iPad so that I can convert it into some kind of ""mini MacBook"" when I need to use the browser or to type stuff.

Apple Pencil is sold separately at $99 each. If you don't mind getting a used device, try looking out for devices sold on Swappa - this website is a reliable website for used device tradings (I got most of my gadgets here, it's safer than eBay too!).

The club is really just a carpool that facilitates people getting to and from places to climb, whether that be the gym here in Ann Arbor or Red River Gorge, New River Gorge, etc.. . But why climb at all?. . Let me put it to you this way. Most sports have an ideal body type. You want to be big and husky for football, or tall and speedy for basketball. Climbing works for all body types, but places different demands on you depending on where you lie. Between the near-infinite types of holds, body positions, orientation of the wall, and combinations of all three, cracking different sequences of moves is an incredibly cerebral process, though this is not to say the sport isn't physically demanding as well (it is.) In terms of both technique and physique the skill ceiling is absurdly high, and there's so much more variety than playing on an open field, as is the case with most sports.. . Climbing is also unique in that there are no agents working against you - only the wall itself. You look up at the wall, plan your moves, fall, and repeat, making more informed decisions with each iteration. In this way, a good route or problem is much more like a puzzle than any other sport you've encountered (skateboarding, BMX, parkour, and rally racing are comparable in that they are heavily dependent upon distinct environments.). .

Avoid anything ""night time"" like sparkles or bodycon material. Avoid clubby heels and summer sandals.. . If you choose a button down blouse, make sure that the buttons do not gap. If you're not confident about the way your buttons function, consider layering a tank top under your blouse and using garment tape to keep the gaps between the buttons closed.. . If your outfit doesn't feel dressy enough, consider adding layers. Someone once explained them to me as ""layers of authority."" For men, it's easy: button down shirt is fairly casual, a button down shirt with just a tie or just a jacket is business casual; a button down shirt with a tie and a jacket is business formal.

It seems silly to me that Ann Arbor seems entirely fine with not only allowing bicycles, but even Boober bike chariot things ride anywhere they want between the road, bike lanes, and sidewalks, but draws the line at anything motorized regardless of top speed and how much space they occupy. I used to see the Boober guys chilling outside of Ulrich's old location [near the Espresso Royale on South U for those of you youngins], riding through the heart of the diag, and occupying entire corners of the sidewalk outside Cantina. That beermobile thing that tops out at 2mph and is a constant nuisance seems to be no problem either despite clearly obstructing traffic in the center of the road. I see no reason why you shouldn't be allowed to ride a Bird scooter or a Hoverboard or any other slow-traveling motorized electric vehicle on the sidewalks.. . >""The city welcomes alternative modes of transportation for residents and visitors, and city staff are actively working with Bird on a licensing agreement."". . >""Do not leave scooters parked on the roads, sidewalks or bike paths and make sure they are clear from driveways, access ramps and fire hydrants."". . I can kinda see this, but the fact of the matter is that nobody is ever going to use Arborbike. It was a cool idea, but the docking stations are way too few, placed way too inconveniently [why would you ever use the one station on the entirety of north campus?], and way too expensive to install and maintain to ever be a viable option. I live in Seattle now, and we have a system called [Lime Bike](https://www.li.me/) which is basically the same as Bird but with bicycles, or Arborbike without the docking stations. And you know what? People actually use it, because you don't have to think too hard about where you're gonna leave it. You can't use Arborbike to ride to class even if you live in North Quad because there isn't a single docking station anywhere in the diag or medical campus. And even if there was, you would probably have to factor in the time it would take to go out of your way to dock the bike then walk the rest of the way to the building you're actually trying to get to.. . Companies like Lime and Bird understand this. And sure, every once and a while you're gonna have some asshole leave it in an inconvenient spot, but most of the time I never even notice them because people are considerate enough not to be assholes about it. And let's face it - both the central campus and north campus diags have more than enough space to handle freestanding Bird scooters without them getting in the way. If Ann Arbor really gave a shit about viable eco-friendly transportation options, they would embrace these companies wholeheartedly. When it comes time to actually implement such options though, we're suddenly much more concerned about having to step around a scooter every once and a while than we are improving public transportation and reducing our carbon footprint.",5.0,error,0.0

Honestly, Career Fair is exhausting, both for the students as well as the recruiters. That being said, it can be worth getting in front of some of the companies you really care about, as that helps them connect a name to a face and can bump you up in priority for scheduling an interview. You do need to pick and choose which companies matter to you and focus on those. Career Fair is not for browsing, and spending 3-4 hours in line may not be worth it for some of the larger companies. You should look for other opportunities to get in front of them outside of career fair. I'd suggest using special events those companies put on (tech talks, info sessions, mock interviews, hack-athons, etc.) to interact with them, and use Career Fair to target the small and medium companies that are only on campus during the fair. Or, if you've spoken with Amazon or Microsoft at one of their events and you really want to work at there, show up right at the beginning of the fair to get them out of the way. But do your homework beforehand and make sure the companies you target are worth talking to. . . Our company had a 45 minute line, so not as bad as Microsoft, but still not good. We had 9 people covering our table, and we're thinking of bringing even more next time, as we really want to give every candidate at least a few minutes to chat. We saw over 300 resumes during the day, which you can imagine is overwhelming for us, but we also attend many events during the days around the career fair to give extra time for people to have 1-1 conversations with us.. . Some companies definitely rely on the Career Fair to get candidates. But some of the big companies don't really need to be there, as they already get thousands of applicants and they're using other means, like the info sessions and tech talks they put on, to source candidates that are really interested in working for them. It's worth keeping an eye out for those events and don't rely only on Career Fair to get in front of them.. . Another thing to keep in mind is that internships fill up fast at the big companies. During these first few weeks of September and October, these companies are at all the major schools around the country, and they only have a limited number of slots, so try to attend events during the fall if you're looking for an internship. If you're looking for full time, it might be better to wait until the Winter career fair, which will be less crazy than the one this week. Those big companies hire for full time positions year round.. . Also, if you're in CS and looking for an internship, try to have taken the main data structures and algorithms course (EECS 281) before you try to interview. That will really help you during the tech portion and is often a minimum requirement for internships at the big companies.. .

Always think about the geometry of whatever problem you're working on, especially if you're lucky enough that the problem is dealing with objects in R^2 or R^3. Drawing a picture almost always helps. Visualizing higher dimensions and functions between them can be difficult, but thinking about a case in lower dimensions is often useful.. 3. Whenever working on a problem, try to keep it clear in your head what types of objects are involved in the problem. For example, you know that if you're trying to add two vectors with different dimensions or add a vector to a scalar, something has gone wrong.. 4. Know the properties and formulae very well for the fundamental operations on vectors and matrices, particularly the dot product, cross product, and determinant. It's worth the time to practice these and learn shortcuts/heuristics that work for you.. 5. As you get into partial differentiation and topics related to it, make sure you keep the different types of differentiation distinct in your head.. 6. Start working on really nailing down the definitions of the major theorems and results from the class. This is especially important once you start on vector calculus and they throw lots of theorems at you. Quiz yourself constantly so that you keep each one in mind, know the relationships between them, and know what they are useful for.. 7. Go to office hours.. 8. Khan Academy is an excellent resource for enhancing your conceptual understanding.. 9. Paul's Online Math Notes has many very helpful examples of how to solve common problems in multivariable/vector calculus.. 10. Go to office hours.. .

The goal is to find a balance between challenging yourself and not dying since you do need to make sure you maintain GPA. Sacrificing quality for quantity is not the way to go if it comes down to that. I didn't transfer in after one year but I did transfer in: I averaged 15 credits per semester and a 3.9 GPA, 33 ACT since they do look at SAT/ACT. Since you will be applying with only one semester of college under you (since your app will be due Feb 1st of 2nd semester), they will still put a lot of weight on your high school transcript. The more semesters of college you have, the less HS matters.. . . . Pretty sure out of state and instate don't make a difference when transferring.

t1_e6ebr8u,2018-09-21 19:40:06,t3_91eum2,t3_91eum2,"South Quad is not all that it is hyped up to me. Don't get me wrong, it is one of the nicer dorms and it is certainly far better than being placed on North campus. South Quad is typically considered to be the best dorm on campus but, in my experience living there, it is far from the top. First of all, South Quad does NOT have air conditioning while pretty much every other ""Quad"" dorm does - west, east, north. What bothers me the most is the lack of social-ness in South Quad. South Quad houses either Honors kids or Athletes, typically separating them by floor. I am in LSA Honors (very good program) but, as expected, most of the honors kids are very anti-social and do not go out. That is obviously completely fine but it just makes it so much harder to make friends at this university, making you feel slightly left out. I luckily was able to make many friends but they all live mostly in East Quad, West Quad, and Markley. This makes it 1. annoying for me to come and see them and 2. much harder to maintain those friendships simply due to the distance between you. In college, you want a social dorm. A social dorm makes your experience so much better and gives you so many friends without any effort. South Quad is the exact opposite (of course, there are exceptions on some floors). Also, the athletes only really socialize with each other so there is definitely a divide. As to the rooms, I believe South Quad has the largest rooms on campus TECHNICALLY, but in reality they are not that big. In East and West quad (also with most of the other dorms), the closets are built into the wall and you and your roommate share it (they're rather large so space isn't typically an issue). In South Quad, you and your roommate each get a HUGE closet that is its own separate piece of furniture. This may sound nice, but the closets take up so much space in the room (especially considering that there are two of them) and you only use maybe half of the storage within the actual closet. West Quad and East Quad have much bigger rooms (with AC) once you take this into account. As of location, South Quad is very nicely located. Probably the best located dorm (along with WQ since its right across the street). Another good thing about South Quad is that we have a pretty good dining hall. Most people consider it the best (or tied with Mojo). I disagree simply because, although there is plenty of variety and the food is of good quality, I am a rather picky eater and the pizza isn't too good (personally, I think EQ has the best dining hall because, even though its much smaller with less variety, they have all of your classic food options and the food there is good quality, especially the cheesy bread and pizza). Overall, it is nice having a nice dining hall in your building.. . . . Overall, I think East Quad, West Quad, or even Markley (simply for the social experience) are the best dorms at Michigan, followed by South Quad. East Quad, to me, is the best. It is VERY social (in large part because it is smaller so it has a better sense of community), it has a dining hall, it is very well located, it has AC/big rooms, and it is near all of the fraternities (if thats your thing). It simply has everything you want in a college dorm. West Quad is also nice, with big rooms/AC and a good location, but it is not TOO social and it doesn't have a dining hall.",1.0,error,0.0

However if you're worried that a 7/10 means you might not be prepared for the exams, then I would definitely recommend spamming practice exams. Go to the exam shop (I think they still have it) and click around whatever topics you don't feel comfortable with and print them out. It'll make a giant practice exam for you (Or print out the old ones). One thing to note about 116 is that you can get a 100% on all the webworks and quizzes, yet still get a poor grade in the class because the exams are filled with these little tricks and nuances that are meant to trip up most students. The best way to acclimate yourself to it is start getting used to the little things they might do to throw you off by getting tricked on the practice exams and not the real thing. Remember, the math department *knows* that every student can take a derivative/integrate some function, so they can't let everyone get 100% (sadly). If all you want is a B, then the average would be around \~65 percent. I think all you need is 1SD above the mean for an A so if you have the time to study without screwing yourself for other classes, it's doable. One thing to note is that my experience was with Math 115, but from what I've looked into and talked about with friends who took 116, they seem to be structured almost exactly the same way sometimes with the same GSIs (except I think 116 has 2 gateways). If you're interested, Math 156 is a much better experience, but you'd be behind by 3 homeworks if you joined this late :/ Hopefully you do fine!",1.0,neutral,0.6323554515838623

Some are great, but I've had more than a few who barely spoke English, didn't actually understand the subject, had no teaching skills whatsoever.... 2. Heavy emphasis on research and applications. At the other universities that I've attended, the professors pretty much said ""here's what will be on the exam--study this and you'll get an A."" Here, they really try to force you to apply your knowledge in new ways. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but you shouldn't be writing *exams* that way. This kind of goes along with the last point--the instructor should be able to get an A on the exam or it isn't fair to the students. . 3. There is nowhere near as much academic support as they like to claim there is at orientation. Fuck the math lab. . 4. I'm not supposed to talk about it, but something happened to me in a university residence hall. The university dealt with it in an unbelievably inept way.

(Well, fully in the sense that it completely came out of the groove it belongs in... No ruptured tendons, though.) I also had a minor avulsion fracture because the tendons ripped off a part of my patella. Totally miserable experience, absolutely. And I was screened for hypermobile joints and they told me I had some light hypermobility but nothing crazy. So it's a slightly different situation than yours but I believe my dislocation was more severe. I can send you the gross pics if you want, lol. . . I wasn't recommended for bed rest, though. I was put in an immobilizer and crutches for two weeks til I saw an orthopedic surgeon who recommended either PT and wait and see or an MPFL reconstruction (a notoriously invasive surgery with a long recovery period). I was moving to Michigan soon so I picked PT. I've done well with that. I'm still doing PT (this is the 3 month mark). I can't fully kneel and still get fatigue in that knee but otherwise I'm back to 100%. . . It happened on a Thursday so I took the next day off and the weekend to just lay around but I was back to work on Monday. My campus offered a mobility service that was free and it would send a car for me and take me door to door to all the places I needed. I believe UM offers the same. . . I'm not a doctor but from my personal experience I really regret being immobilized for two weeks. Basically everyone said it made my recovery harder because my quadriceps muscles got really weak and you need those to keep the patella in place. . . So I'd get a second opinion imo. I saw Jason Shellhaas at UHS when I got here and he recommended against the surgery I initially mentioned. I am doing PT at UHS and I like them. They work with you well. But make sure you are comfortable with your doctor's advice... As someone who recently had a relatively severe and traumatic patella dislocation, three weeks of bedrest sounds totally nuts.. .

My experience is certainly not everyone's, or even most people's, but I grew up in a fairly well-off neighborhood, where **""The Track""** was that you did really well in high school, got into a top school, did really well there, got a top job at a brand-name company, and then you were set and basically done with life, career-wise. . . . . I was the first in my family to apply to schools in the US, so I didn't even really know what I wanted, just that there were these ideal ""elite"" schools somewhere. I think I applied to Michigan and then just Harvard and Yale, because I literally didn't know any other schools. Got waitlisted at Yale and eventually denied, probably because my application revealed that I had no idea what I wanted to do in college.. . . . So, I actually started out at UofM feeling like I had done some terrible thing, like I'd never make it back onto ""The Track"", whatever it was supposed to be. But I quickly found out that ""The Track"" isn't actually where I wanted to be. . . . . Michigan gave me the opportunity to dabble in a ton of things -- I switched majors 4 times, moving from Ross BBA to Engineering, even briefly considering neuroscience. I got involved in the Center for Entrepreneurship because I found out that I really disliked working in a big company. Did a summer internship with a $100M Venture Capital firm that was run by 2 UofM grads because I was honest about my goals -- that I didn't want to work in a big company, and I really had no idea what industry I was interested in, but was willing to learn about a lot really quickly. I volunteered at MHacks after joining MPowered, and chatted with the winners, eventually joining them and securing grant funding and a spot in TechArb. Since then, I've worked at a startup that failed spectacularly, co-founded a successful one with friends, and have in general done a lot of different things inside and outside work in the 4 years since graduation. It's been way more fun and empowering than following a vague notion of what I'm ""supposed"" to do. I'm currently working on starting a boutique consulting firm for growing businesses with some people I know. . . . . Now, I'm not saying that everyone needs to be involved in entrepreneurship (in fact, it's way-too-often used as a meaningless buzzword), or that it's bad to start your college career knowing that you want to be a doctor/lawyer/programmer. If you know what you want to do, that's amazing! Way way easier for you than for the rest of us. But, odds are that if I had gotten off the waitlist at Yale and followed ""The Track"" to...I'm not entirely sure --- law? General middle management?... I wouldn't have felt like I have the control over my work and social life that I do right now. Michigan taught me that there's a way to do what you want in life, even if it's unconventional -- ***especially*** if it's unconventional! . . . . My friends from college run the gamut -- socialist activists, wall street bankers, National Park rangers, a theoretical mathematician, a guy who works for the Japanese Embassy, a guy who moved to Mongolia, multiple people who have started their own startups or small businesses or volunteer organizations.

Coming to Michigan was a choice I made because I wanted to get out of there. I love my hometown, and I don't think I'd rather have grown up anywhere else, but I had no interest in going back. . . My experience at UM allowed me to do exactly that. I had every resource I could need to succeed at a high level. I did a start up, joined service clubs, met people from a crazy broad range of backgrounds, and found the niche I wanted to pursue in a career. I was then able to prepare for that career and get an awesome job. . . And then when I lost that job within months of starting my first job (due to my facility being shut down) I was able to bounce back and get an even better job because of the things I learned and did at school, and because of the high reputation of Michigan in my field. . . And the thing that is most impressive to me about Michigan, is that people have the same stories with nearly every degree from Michigan. It's a leader in almost every field that they offer degrees, so it doesn't matter if my story was from engineering or business or medicine or whatever. The same experience will be echoed by everyone. . . Edit: I think I rambled a bit off topic. To wrap back to your point, the fact that Michigan is a big school with so many amazing programs, means it attracts a huge variety of people, who approach problems or issues from many different directions. In working with or alongside these various experiences, you learn to understand broader context and the fact that most issues have many solutions. . . You are then challenged to find the best solution, not just something that works.

Also you deal a lot with functional programming languages which changed my entire viewpoint of programming and has helped me tremendously with more modern languages that deal heavily with closures and that sort of thing.

Workload isn't too bad either, but as far as real security I'm not sure how useful this is. They talk about old vulnerabilities, and while it's not realistic to make students find 0-day vulnerabilities in a course, I feel like there's definitely a reason it's considered an introductory class to security.. . 493: If you don't know HTML, CSS, or Javascript, this is a pretty gentle introduction due to it being a light workload. However, I don't think anything it teaches would be difficult to learn on your own. This is mostly a filler class for people that need the credits and can't survive taking 2-3 harder courses at once.. . 492: Maybe the worst course I've taken, though 370 is also just an all-around awful course. First homework is centered around some 281 concepts (pruning, BFS, DFS,) and the second unit looks to be a rehashing of 203 concepts. I know there's also a unit on machine learning (which is explored in-depth in 445,) so I'm not sure if there's really any material in this course you couldn't get somewhere else.. . 485: Easily the best course I've taken so far. This is the only course I've taken where I feel like an employer might actually want me to do work similar to the work in the class. It's a smorgasbord of HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Bash, SQLite, and probably more that I haven't gotten into yet, but it's also surprisingly manageable and not conceptually difficult.

Furthermore, the school isn't even *that* selective with who it lets speak; we have controversial speakers all the time. Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannapoulos, and Charles Murray come to mind. The only time I can remember a speaker actually being prevented from speaking is Richard Spencer, so it seems like most things short of literal white nationalism are fair game. Speakers are usually given platforms based on merit, and so I expect that if Alex Jones wanted to speak here he wouldn't be given a platform. It's also why I don't think Milo should have been given a platform: he's a useless troll. . . . I think it's ridiculous that people think the school is an echo chamber.

The location is also perfect as it's just a few mins walk to Central campus. When I had classes in EH or Weiser, it only took me 3-5 mins walking to reach there.. .

Kudos to you for looking into this, hoping that many other U-M students registered here will do the same. Voting for regents can be really hard. They do have public meetings (legally required per the state's Open Meeting Act) but all the real stuff is behind the scenes, so it can be tough to know exactly where someone stands sometimes without extensive knowledge of their meetings or reading of sourced reporting. . . In addition, most candidates will tell you they want to keep tuition low, increase access to U-M, and grow the economic impact of the school. . . [AnnArborVotes.org](http://annarborvotes.org/university-of-michigan-regents-nov-2018) has a good overview of some of the candidates and links to campaign websites where available. There are also links to recent news stories involving them.. . Andrea Fischer Newman is seeking her 4th eight year term and Andrew Richner his 3rd term. There are several running against them but Paul Brown and Jordan Acker are the serious challengers. . . Warning that what I'm writing below is less objective and sprinkled with my own opinion.. . Given her election was first in 1994, Fischer Newman is deeply embedded within the university. I think this is best exemplified by the fact that her [reelection website](https://www.andreafischernewman.com/) is just endorsement videos from folks with the last name Schembechler, Harbaugh, and Carr. She had some [campaign finance stuff](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/administration/regent-wrapped-campaign-contribution-scandal-free-press-reports) pop up recently, you can decide to what extent it is or isn't an issue.. . I will admit I know little about Richner. He is a former state representative and is more involved in state/national politics than some of the other board members. I am sure some folks will disagree with this logic, but the fact that he was a MI congressional chair for the Trump campaign disqualifies him from getting my vote. I understand that campaigning at the state/local level is very different but I will not vote for someone who looked at that candidate and fell in line. . . I do plan to vote for [Paul Brown](https://www.gobluevotebrown.com/). There are (I think) several good reasons why but I am interested in the fact that he has experience as an adjunct faculty member at U-M and is a member of the lecturer's union. U-M is increasingly hiring adjunct faculty do to a greater share of the teaching and I think it is important to have a voice on the board from someone with that perspective. . .

They are just not being given a recommendation letter the receipt of which isn't a right.. . I don't like the use of 'rights' language in this context, but you're incorrect here. Recommendation letters are an educational resource in the context of Title VI. A professor can no more refuse to write a recommendation letter based on national origin concerns than they can refuse to write a recommendation letter because they just don't like black people.. . If the university fails to act, the university itself faces substantial liability for enacting a discriminatory policy contrary to law. Would a lawsuit win in court? I have no idea. But I think most any decent lawyer would tell you that the university would probably settle rather than face the negative publicity that would result.. . In purely financial terms, the potential damage this man could do to the university vastly outweighs any reasonable value he could bring to it - which is why, had he been a conventional private sector employee, he almost certainly would have been fired outright.. . But I feel a better way to grasp what is going on is in terms of *professional obligations*. A large part of the job of any professor is mentoring students - including providing them recommendations so they can advance in their career and educational goals. When the professor refuses to participate because they're introducing their own political beliefs into the process, they are simply failing to do their job.. . You clearly think that the professor's political beliefs are right. However, that just doesn't matter here. This is about an employee failing to act professionally and willfully damaging the interests of their employer.. . > Of course, I'm a little surprised that you find this to be ""an abuse"" on the part of the professor.. .

They do not have a right to any recommendation letter full stop.. . . . . He didn't discriminate against anyone. His reason had nothing to do with the student. He refused to write a letter on the basis of an academic boycott. To be going to Title VI here is a pretty wild reach. The student wasn't Israeli, and even if she was, *he wasn't refusing on grounds that were in any way related to the student themselves* but only to the organization she wanted to work with.. . . . . In terms of professional obligations, I think you misunderstand the limits of that concept. Again, really reaching for anything here. The professor does have a responsibility to properly educate and act as a resource to students. That does not mean they cannot bring their beliefs into the situation. To think that somehow a professor has any sor of obligation of political neutrality is insane, and, just want to note, the neutral position would be *not writing a letter, and then suggesting the student seek out a professor who was willing to write it,* which as far as I know, he did.. . . . . Beyond that, there are substantive limits to these obligations. If a student wanted to study with Al Qaeda, or the Islamic State, or, just taking a shot in the dark here at your beliefs and assuming you'd put Iran in that same boat, *Iran,* a professor isn't obligated to write that letter, even given a lack of safety concerns.. . . . . The last thing is, your belief in corporatizing the University is pretty disturbing. To think of the relationship between the University and the body of professors as something that is purely transactional, purely an employer/employee dynamic is just crazy. The reason concepts such as tenure exist is to grant professors independence. The basis of academia is in the lack of ideological accountability to the University. The framework and lens that you seem to see this through are anathema to the very concept of academia. I don't think anyone would be calling for Prof. Victor Lieberman to be punished if he refused to write a letter for a student looking to study in Gaza under the supervision of a Palestinian group. But of course they wouldnt. Because this isn't about a professor's rights. It's about a University taking a hard line in support of an apartheid state, or at the minimum, it's stance on the conflict. It's also setting a pretty hard precedent that a professor is obligated (though no rule existed prior to this incident) to write a letter for any student who seeks to work with a discriminatory organization, as that is not a reasonable excuse to decline the letter, or at least, that's the standard being set by Elizabeth Cole. So if a student wants to work with an organization that discriminates against black people, or Jewish people, or gay people, well, the professor cannot decline to write a letter on those grounds by this new standard.",2.0,error,0.0

Fairs are great for having access to a lot of companies in one location so you can meet a lot of them in a short amount of time. However, if you want to develop a deeper relationship with certain companies then you probably want to do more than just a career fair.. . That might be on-campus info sessions or it could be networking events. Some people compare recruiting to dating. Usually, it's not the case in which you meet someone and start dating them right away.. . And it's not always convenient time-wise to attend info sessions or networking events but it's probably more effective. I've seen a line at a career fair that had 50+ students. So you might wait in line for an hour and then you get a few minutes to chat with the recruiter because there are other students they need to speak to as well. A lot of the big companies will also have smaller more intimate events at their headquarters or local offices where you can spend quality time with them and get an inside track on what you need to understand to standout. But more students will stand in line versus the networking route. . . Also there are companies like Quicken Loans who hire close to a 1000 interns for the summer. They hire for a range of internships all throughout their company. Quicken is under Dan Gilbert. And there are other companies under the Quicken/Dan Gilbert umbrella. So maybe try starting at a place like Quicken where they hire a lot of interns and then use that opportunity to look at other companies if that's not somewhere you see yourself at long term.. . Interning/working in a professional environment, regardless of if it's a big name company or your dream position, will help you figure out what you like and don't like. It'll also likely have setbacks and conflict, which is great when you're able to look back on those situations and talk about how you overcame them.. .

The only 2 classes he'll be missing out on are ENGR 100 and 101. 101, like I said, can be replaced by 183, which could potentially be more helpful for CS/Data Science track especially if he doesn't have any experience coming into Uni. 100 you could potentially get overrides for but everyone I've spoken to either didn't like the class topic or felt that the course was designed for freshmen to get a B because it was so picky.

That means that LSA will look at you as more of a generic liberal arts student, rather than as a CS student specifically.. . From my experience, this means that a big difference between the two colleges' admissions processes are about your test scores. If you have a mediocre Math score and a great English score, then LSA won't have a problem picking you up, even if you're a prospective CS major. On the other hand, Engineering really wants to see that soaring Math score, and they care much less about the English score.. . This ultimately dictated where I ended up applying to; with my math score, Engineering probably would've filtered out my application right away (I had an advisor tell me so much!). But my English score helped make up for that and got me into LSA.. . It sounds to me that you probably won't have much of a problem getting in either way. That being said, if you're really concerned about getting in, then consider basing your choice around the college that might value your application more. As others said, Engineering tends to enforce more rigorous classes and requirements, so they may have an overall slightly more rigorous application process as well. Without knowing anything else about your academic record, I would recommend that you apply to Engineering, as they would likely value your extensive programming background more than LSA would (and they would also probably care less about any relative lack of extra-curriculars, although I'm not totally certain of that).. .

What's called conservatism today [is anything but conservative](https://youtu.be/ujDltzATwk0). Conservatism today is NOT focused on small government - conservatives of today are focused on the upward transfer of wealth to very few hands, and they utilize institutions that epitomize big government, like the military, to the end of publicizing risk and research and privatizing the profit from that risk and research, for example.. . >I'm a conservative, meaning I want the federal government to spend less money, be smaller, and do ONLY what it's supposed to do according to the constitution.. . The constitution doesn't deserve the worship it gets. It failed to be a living document that updates with the times, as some of our founders (notably Jefferson) would have it. Lots of the classical liberal ideals behind the constitution are really great, though. (Many scholars, notably Rudolf Rocker, view anarcho-syndicalism as the natural translation of classical liberalism to the modern world). . >I want state a local governments to do everything else.

Also a carbon credit isn't enough to stop catastrophic global warming at this point, if we're to believe the IPCC, who are by far the most conservative scientific body on the issue of global warming.. . >I do find myself sometimes reacting poorly to political discussions because people like you lump everyone who votes for a strong defense and tax cuts into a ""racist and climate change denier"" category.. . You can blame that on the Republican party. You shouldn't call yourself a conservative anymore if you want to avoid that. If you've supported the modern conservative movement in any way, you're at best extremely misguided, and there's little to be gained by attempting to ""convert"" you, so the consequences of your actions must be addressed instead.. . >Just like not every liberal wants to open all borders, provide a universal income, and institute socialism,. . No liberals want to do that. Those are social democrats/democratic socialists.. . >not every conservative is a racist bigot.. .

I've talked to lots of ""libertarians"" and ""sensible"" conservatives, and they're either just low key Republicans or the issues they care about don't actually fucking matter. The best I'll say is that they've identified the problems (neoliberals just pretend that people aren't suffering, conservatives mobilize the popular anger of the ones suffering) but they've misdiagnosed the causes. I'm opening my mind to you now, aren't you a middle of the road conservative?. . >I bet you and I, though we would disagree on several issues, would agree on MUCH MUCH more than we disagree on.. . We would perhaps agree on what the problems are, but not how to solve them. The field of popular ""acceptable"" political thought is so narrow - it's basically just neoliberalism and hard right reactionary nonsense - that the only way most people can come close to something resembling a solution (conservatism) is to 1. abandon the natural conception of the inherent value of human life and 2. turn on the meekest victims of capitalism and believe they are the cause of these problems, rather than what they really are.

There are big screens within the stadium, so if you can't see what's happening on the field with your own eyes, you'll at least have that. Parking on campus gets to be a problem as early as the Friday before any home game. Some spots go for big bucks ($40+), and get more expensive the closer you park to the stadium. There's street parking everywhere on campus if you know where to look, but you should dedicate some time finding parking if that's the case. There are also parking structures all over downtown Ann Arbor, but they're all a walk from the stadium. Tailgating starts early; you won't have a hard time finding a good time, I think.. . If you are opting out of the game, there's tons to do on campus and in the city. Most of the buildings should be open, during normal operating hours, but will lock around 4pm ot 5pm. The libraries will be open though, but don't expect to see too much going on; the most you'll see are people studying (if it's game day, then campus outside of the Big House will be a bit scant). We don't hold classes or faculty/staff hours on the weekends, so it'll be pretty nice on campus.

Next, you should look into your specific major for Engineering. Each major will have the own requirements, and you will have to find the list of classes for that. Basically, once you have all of those required courses done, you can graduate.. . For Ross, all the reqs are pretty much laid out to you. Just see the semester calendar thing in the Ross link above.. . Finally, there is distribution. Engineering distribution allows AP credits and the only specific thing in there is that 3 credits have to be an 300-level humanities class. If you are doing Ross, all of your Ross classes should cover the Engineering distribution requirements.. . For Ross distribution, you have to pick 3 out of 4:. . \-9 credits math/natural science. . \-9 credits humanities. . \-9 credits social science. . \-proficiency in a language.. . AP credits aren't accepted for these except for the language requirement. However, your engineering courses should cover the 9 credits of math. So just pick either 9 creds humanities or 9 creds social sceience.. . Dual degrees usually graduate in five years, but if you have enough credits you can graduate in 4.5 or 4.. . . . **Essay tips:**. . Since the Ross and Engineering applications are separate, you technically don't have to talk about anything that has to do with both. My suggestion is, for the engineering app only talk about your STEM interests and Umich's Engineering program. Umich Engineering is top ranked in almost all majors, so just pick the one that interests you, look at the required courses, find a few courses that interest you, and explain that in your essay. Engineering also has a lot of project teams, like MRover, Solar Car, etc and lots of research opportunities.. . For the Ross app, focus on your business experience, leadership, and communication skills. You can also check out the list of Ross clubs here: [https://michiganross.umich.edu/our-community/students/clubs-organizations/browse-all](https://michiganross.umich.edu/our-community/students/clubs-organizations/browse-all). . Some major highlights are the consulting clubs (super hard to get in, but a great experience since you get to work with actual companies) and the investing clubs (also pretty hard to get in, but they teach you a lot) and finally the business frats (great social experience, also hard to get in lol). Pretty much all of these clubs at Ross have large alumni networks and professional development sessions, so it will be a lot easier for you to land a job/internship if you are part of these clubs.. . Also, like other people have said, don't focus your essay on these opportunities themselves, but focus on how the university relates to you. . . . . I hope this helps, and best of luck on your application. Ross BBA and Umich COE are both great programs, and in my opinion a dual degree is definitely worth it. Once again, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.",9.0,error,0.0

I've watched Michigan football games, and I visited the big house (although I didn't go inside). Everyone there was happy to be there. They were proud to be part of Michigan. I go to a school where our football team suck ass, and nobody really has any school spirit. Nobody is proud to say where they go to school, and even less people rep it. There's no sense of unity here, no sense of community or togetherness. It's just people who compete against each other. It's toxic as hell and I want to get out. I see Michigan as a place where people want to be there. They, and even the people living in Ann Arbor, love Michigan. By having a good football team, people of all walks of life, studying and believing in all sorts of ideals, rally around the blue and maize. 100k of them, packed in a stadium, cheering for wolverines.

College should be a place where I can meet a variety of different people, at a large public school.

Probably not directly related to ongoing autonomous driving development.. . This is likely related to or an extension of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute's (aka UMTRI) [Safety Pilot](http://safetypilot.umtri.umich.edu/index.php?content=about) of [Wifi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11p) based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) devices in Ann Arbor. You might have noticed their big router like devices on street lights and traffic lights, or [the white MobileMark antennas](https://www.mobilemark.com/product/surface-mount-multiband-694-894-1700-2400-mhz-cellular-lte-700-antenna-for-gps-applications) on busses.. . V2X, at least when I was involved, wasn't driven by autonomous driving, but by a general shift in safety strategies away from cars that survive accidents better (crumple zones, more airbags, etc) to cars that can avoid accidents (collision detection, lane departure warnings, etc). With vehicles equipped with devices that send/receive ""hey I'm here and traveling this fast in this direction"" messages, you can do stuff like detect forward collision hazards quickier and more reliably than using radar.. . On a side note, this is heavily driven by NHTSA going ""hey you want that fancy 5-star rating? Better start developing accident avoidance equipment!"" People like safety equipment, but they aren't generally willing to pay more for it. Since cars in the US are sold are pretty tight margins, OEMs are reluctant to add additional safety equipment lest they have have to bump up the price and hurt sales. Yes, I know the US isn't the only car market, and the dynamics are different elsewhere, but you dangle ""oh we'll continue to give you 5-stars if you add _____"" in front of Toyota or Subaru and shit gets done.. . Anyway, while V2X is helpful for autonomous driving, it's a separate area of development. Even if these devices were mandidated today, it would take a long time before they reach critical mass. You can't design autonomous cars that hit the roads in the near future if you depend on technology that might take a full decade to fully propagate. The most practical scenario I can think of is maybe doing a selectively install of V2X devices on more troublesome traffic lights?. . I haven't been involved in any V2X work in a number of years, but I remember there was a lot of excitement about MCity. . Cities present a lot of challenges for V2X hardware that are difficult to replicate in a controlled testing environment. It's not hard to get messages at 1km+ in an open field, even at higher speeds, nor is there a shortage of tracks to test on. It's much more interesting when you don't have line of sight and have to sort through signals bouncing off buildings, and a lot of [fancy vehicle testing facilities](http://www.trcpg.com/virtual-facility-tour/) don't have the equivalent of MCity.. . And bringing this all back around, in ~2014 there was a lot of ongoing debate about whether Wifi or Cellular/LTE should be used as the basis for V2X. It sounds like [LTE is winning out](http://5gaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/5GAA-Road-safety-FINAL2017-12-05.pdf), and to get with the times, I'm guessing UMTRI wants to deploy LTE based V2X devices to MCity.",5.0,error,0.0

Before Prop 1 passed, it was illegal to possess marijuana both on and off campus. However, because campus property is strictly under the jurisdiction of the state of Michigan, possession on campus carried a more severe punishment than off campus, where you are under the jurisdiction of the city of Ann Arbor. Under Michigan law, marijuana possession was a misdemeanor, whereas under Ann Arbor law it was only a civil infraction (like a traffic ticket). Now possession will not be a crime under either Ann Arbor or state of Michigan jurisdiction. In theory, both university police and Ann Arbor police could still arrest you for possession under federal statute, although almost certainly Ann Arbor will prohibit their cops from doing so.. . So, UMPD can still arrest you for possession. In fact, they will be required to: because UM receives federal funding, it is required to maintain a drug-free campus. So, university police can arrest you and refer you to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution, which can take a number of steps including official sanctions. I don't think these sanctions are serious unless you are an athlete or live on campus (if so, OSCR will refer the matter to student housing or the athletic department).. . However, you will not be charged with a federal crime: a federal prosecutor working for the federal Department of Justice is not going to waste his or her time prosecuting individual college students for getting high. In fact, they are not even allowed to: under the DoJ internal guidelines for charging defendants, you must be found in possession of rather large quantities of marijuana for federal prosecutors to be allowed to indict you. Unless you are running a serious dealing operation on campus, that's not going to be an issue.. . Finally, you can still be charged for marijuana-related crimes under state law both on and off campus: although Prop 1 makes both possession and consumption legal, you are only allowed to possess 2.5 oz and public consumption is still illegal under state law. Selling marijuana without a license will remain illegal indefinitely, and licenses likely will not be available until 2020. It will be legal to grow small amounts of weed, though plants can't be visible to the public and access must be restricted (via a lock or something). Of course, driving under the influence remains illegal. All of this goes into effect 10 days after the election is certified, which will probably happen before the new year.. .

Car driver: woman, 20-30s?. . what happened: car T boned by bus. . situation: about 80% full bus?. . . . A white Jeep Cherokee was making a left turn, while the bus Northwood was going forwards. I personally couldn't see the traffic light so idk whose actual fault it was. We were not going at too much speed, maybe 10-30 mph but speed is hard to tell when your sitting in a bus.. . I think the driver of our bus was a little slow reacting, since I knew we were gonna crash before the driver applied the brakes.. . The driver saw the vehicle and applied the horn and brakes. Some people let out a surprised/worried gasp as we heard the sound of metal and glass breaking. The crash wasn't the worst, but there was a considerable force. I think the jeep's right wheels were actually lifted about 2 feet off the ground at one point. Inside our bus, I think some people might have fallen down or been at least shaken? I was sitting facing forwards, and my knees absorbed most of my momentum. . There was considerable damage to the jeep: the right door had deep scratches and dents, the side window was broken and the airbag was deployed. There was minimal damage to out bus: the plastic bumper was bent in, there was some wiring exposed in on the corner, some scratches and if I remember correctly, the headlight was broken as well.. . The driver was uninjured I think, and she moved the car outside the intersection. I believe she remained in the car for a while as other people confirmed she was ok. The bus driver parked the bus right outside cousins and everyone got out. The bus driver then brought out a hard pad and began collecting signatures? (maybe for witnesses idk) and began talking to the radio to his other bus driver friends.. . Another Northwood bus came about 5-10 mins later.. . . . No one was injured, but this experience was surreal and I feel blessed to be a part of something so cathartic.

Also, assuming the exam style hasn't changed and Perry still teaches the class, do the short answer questions first. It may be 40% of the exam, but they take the most amount of time, and you will at least get partial credit. There were always a handful of exams that I saw with no responses on some questions. Better to at least get something out of those.. . And if you didn't know this already, the GSI writes the exams for Extreme Weather.

t1_e9sy4xi,2018-11-16 07:57:37,t3_9xdhs2,t3_9xdhs2,"I'm a senior studying CS at Michigan (also a transfer.) I got into U-M and UIUC and deciding between the two was a big deal for me, also. I ultimately made my decision based on Michigan accepting a ton of my credits for requirements - UIUC accepted the credits, but didn't let them count toward distribution. While I didn't attend UIUC and thus can't compare the two, I have no shortage of negative things to say about Michigan's CS program.. . First and foremost: The CS department at Michigan originated as a derivative of the math department. This explains a lot to students that have taken some of the more theoretical classes. Most universities require some form of Discrete Math or theory-heavy course. At Michigan, we have two that are required (203 and 376) as well as a handful of electives (Algorithms, Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages, Machine Learning.) Interestingly enough, the courses on theory far outnumber the courses where you're primarily programming. For those interested in research or academia, I suppose the course selection at Michigan might be helpful, but even then, alumni say that most of the theory courses are useless anyway! Machine Learning is the only theory course I've heard people say is great. For software engineering, only a couple courses will really help you. It's really weird to study computer science and not actually do that much coding.. . Faculty-wise, the department itself is fucking stubborn. Plenty of courses have obvious design flaws, whether the slides are bad, the professors are bad (this isn't very common,) or the course itself seems very scattered, trying to cover a lot of material but in practice not helping you master any of it. One of my current professors (a good one) told me that while he was interested in helping change the course material for the department, he was told by senior employees that his suggestions could be seen as insubordination and was thus wary about it. To me this demonstrates that the department operates based on tradition and ego over the quality of education provided to the students. Plenty of project code and other materials given to students are riddled with errors that the staff have had multiple semesters to fix, only to neglect clear and fixable issues.. . I should also mention the way courses are curved. In theory this shouldn't be anything more than a cosmetic difference, as you're still covering the same material, but in practice it's incredibly discouraging and demoralizing: Professors want students to receive low scores. Averages on exams and in classes in general are low, and at the end of the semester they are curved up so that people don't fail. The worst time I experienced this, I was in a class where the average was actually quite high, but the final was intentionally made for students to average exam scores in the 50s simply to lower the average, which they then curved up to an average of a B+. You could say that the standard of performance or skill ceiling of the classes are high to encourage students to do better, but in practice this doesn't really happen. All it does is damage your confidence in your abilities and foster apathy. It also means you're secretly hoping for other people to fail to bolster your grade, which isn't exactly great if you want a friendly and cooperative learning environment.. . Mental health is also a joke to the university. The counseling center (CAPS) is notoriously bad, though a few people have good stories to tell about them. For those of us on north campus, the situation is much more grim; only one(!) therapist is assigned to all \~13,000 engineering students. But hey, why spend money on mental health when the football stadium is what draws money?. . So what good can I say about the CS department? Honestly, not much. Out of ten courses I've taken, only two have been genuinely useful and enjoyable (these being 281 and 485.) There are a couple courses I missed out on that I hear are great, but compared to the sheer amount of time I spent learning things that were made more difficult than necessary, or which are completely useless, I'm confident that many universities can offer a higher quality education, even if they don't have the same legacy that Michigan does. . . . EDIT: Just noticed you asked about 281, 370, and 376. Transfers often talk about or attempt to take them all at once. It's nicknamed the ""suicide three"" and is generally not advisable. I know a handful of people that have done it, and everyone describes it as a stupidly busy semester. If I were you, I would try and take 281 during a light semester, both because it's more manageable as well as it being one of the few good courses here. You should really take it when you have the breathing room to absorb as much of that class as you can - there's a difference between passing the class and really soaking in the concepts.",12.0,error,0.0

Their CS program is simply better than ours. A big problem at Michigan is that anyone can declare the CS major. While it's admirable that the university is trying to allow that, it makes the major an enormous mess. Compared to the more hardware-based classes I've taken, the CS ones have felt more impersonal, more cutthroat, and generally a poorer experience.

First of all though, I would like to talk about some of the stuff you've said. One thing that is kind of tangential to this conversation but I hear people talk a lot about is that we spend money on football instead of other things. In reality, the football program not only completely funds itself, but it also funds other things at the university like all sports that are not men's hockey or men's basketball. . . Also, while I understand it's frustrating to get a low grade, your actual percentage doesn't really matter. For many classes I've taken here, professors will give you a way to figure out where you stand in the course in the middle of the semester if they don't straight up tell you.. . I will admit that I wish I would code a little more in some classes, but I've found that most students here don't struggle to get internships if they are motivated.. . One unique thing about U of M compared to many other schools is that the core programming curriculum is taught in C++. I think this makes it easier to understand a lot of concepts that are pretty vital to a CS degree. I've also heard several companies say that they value that we learn C++ (although some of them were trading companies that primarily write C++ code.). . I also used to be pretty annoyed about the waitlists for classes. I honestly think the problem is overblown though. I'm pretty confident I'll be able to take every class I really want to take before I graduate, and I came in with 0 AP credit. They have even started to take measure to fix this problem by stopping people from waitlisting an absurd number of classes which was the real problem.. . I also agree that some classes are very theoretical at this University, but I think that's a good thing and I have no plan to go into research. There is lots of good resources online to learn how to code and there are many self explanatory books on writing good code. I don't think that stuff is all that necessary to learn from a professor, where as topics like operating systems and machine learning are very hard to learn from the resources available online.",7.0,neutral,0.528825044631958

The class is, instead, centered around making a payload (""satellite"") that goes up to near-space and collects data to answer a scientific query. So the latter half of the course is project based and you can goto the lab whenever, in order to work on the project. I think most people spent 2-4 hours a week on the course (outside of lectures). I'm fairly certain that everyone got above a B and most people ended up with an A in the course (including those who put in minimal effort).

The major is a bit theory / history heavy, which really gets under my skin as a production guy, but I balanced that out by taking as many allowable production classes as possible in order to build a gigantic portfolio. The production courses are great; Professor Rayher is pretty controversial as a teacher, and though I don't like his courses, I highly recommend taking his SAC300 course. You will learn a lot; you'll hate him, but you'll learn a lot.. . Other than that, take any and all courses taught by David Marek (his documentary course was insanely useful, I got a job through that) and take SAC290 with him as well. Chris McNamara's New Media Practices is a great prod course in terms of animation, so I recommend that. I've also heard that Terri Sarris is good, though I've never had her. . . In terms of theory/history, again, do your best to take things you like. I have zero interest in either theory or history and I still believe it's fucking useless in terms of getting applicable job experience or industry knowledge; that being said, Mark Kligermans courses are great. I'm glad that I took the majority of my studies courses with him, he is an amazing person to learn from and makes the material really compelling. . . During my recent job search, I was actually pleasantly surprised to see how well FMTV majors do in the industry. You will learn a lot, and my advice to you is to focus on what you love, whether that be production or studies.

Most frequent place we went was the [McDonald's next to Nickels Arcade](https://aadl.org/sites/default/files/aa_news/aa_news_19950724-rumors_come_true.jpg). ~~I wish I could find a picture of it...~~ City council wouldn't let them build a ""normal"" McDonald's, so it was in a brick building without any of the usual signs.. . The Taco Bell was in an [old building](http://media.mlive.com/ann-arbor-business_impact/photo/mia-zasjpg-ffea5fbfb8fc4f7c.jpg) across from the School of Education. It was the sketchiest, most run-down place you can imagine. (The picture is *after* they redid the entrance and facade, so imagine that but way grimier.) There were also Burger Kings (Burgers King?) on the corner of Maynard and Liberty (right next to where Skeeps is, lol) and where Starbucks is on South U. And of course the McDonald's where Bubble Island is now.. . As far as why they all closed, in my opinion it was a combination of factors that started in the 90s and really came to a head in the early 00s. Fast food places were blindsided by the movement for healthy, organic, and artisan food. Franchises have never done well in downtown Ann Arbor - you have to pay royalties and fees on top of all your other expenses, so you're always at a disadvantage. The fast food places (being open late) tended to be a target for late night drunks and other weird characters. It was so bad in the 80s that my friend was hired by the South U McDonald's to stand at the door and decide whether to let people in at night (they called him the McBouncer, lol). .

Double honors requires all its students to be enrolled in a structured study group (SSG) section led by an upperclassman who took the course previously. SSG is useful in that your class will be further divided into smaller groups of hardworking and motivated students like yourself with whom you can study, and you will get additional opportunities (assignments and projects) to interact with the course material in greater depth and breadth. So if you'd like to learn organic chemistry in greater detail and with a smaller group of talented students, double honors may be right for you. I would estimate that the time commitment for double honors is more than that for regular 215/216, but more of that time is spent working on fun and interesting projects and less on actual studying. The class doesn't end up being inherently harder because a.) the grade for double honors is inflated by weekly in-class quizzes and the semester-long HTML project for SSG, and b.) the smaller class environment is more intimate and better facilitates learning.. . . . Professor Coppola says this year after year, and I'll repeat his advice because I find it valid and valuable for someone who is still unsure whether to take double honors:. .

I made some friends, discovered some interests, and really enjoyed myself. So I hope that I'll be able to give you some helpful advice. . . . . First--school spirit is overrated. When I daydream about myself on the weekend at U-M during game days, it's not about tailgating and going to the Big House or the Chrysler Arena. It's about enjoying the solitude of a mostly deserted campus, maybe visiting the local comic book store and hanging out with friends. I think I attended two or three sports events in all the time I was there. I'd recommend going to one or two, just to take in the atmosphere. I mean, you're there, so if nothing else see what all the fuss is about, then walk away content in the knowledge it isn't for you. Or it might be for you, in which case congratulations on discovering something new you like.. . Having said that, I do think you should take some pride at being considered good enough to go to U-M. At least get a maize and blue shirt or two. :) . . Also, you're not immediately going to vibe with people just because you have similar interests. It does take a few tries. Do yourself a favor, though, and look up all the groups U-M has to offer. It's a big university with a big city, and I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find something. Not to mention that everyone is a student, and for the most part this is a time when you're exploring new interests and opportunities. Is there something you've always wanted to try? An intramural sport, a martial art? You can make a list of things you'd like to try, then start searching to see if there are any groups around for them. . . As far as conversation, I think a large part of it requires you to put yourself out there. I know my conversation skills improved immensely once I joined a club or two and made myself go to the meetings. . . . . Having said all that, there is nothing wrong with being alone. I know that part of the allure of being in a college town like Ann Arbor is that everyone seems to be going out with friends, running around and having a great time. However, that isn't everyone. Thousands of other people are getting together in their homes. Not having a house party, not chugging cheap beer by the keg, but just sitting around talking. There are a lot of quiet people, and there are a lot of people who are by themselves on a Saturday night. If you are alone again on a weekend, don't feel bad and don't feel ashamed. Maybe reach out to friends via Facebook or Reddit. . . . . The biggest thing I want to say is this--it takes time. Meeting people takes time. Getting friends takes time. Getting non-crappy friends can take even longer, but it is worth it. What about those people you clicked with? Are they grad students? If they are, maybe contact them and ask them for advice. . .",5.0,error,0.0

My issue is that the people I am friends with don't know each other, so rather than having a group to fall back on my friendships are scattered. . . Of course, I'm not particularly close with any of them. I don't know if I want to be. My best friends have known me for years and have seen me grow as a person, they know what I'm proud of and what makes me happy. They saw me struggle and know what pisses me off. How could anybody I've known for a few months ago possibly be at that level. Thinking about it that way reminds me that I don't need a best friend here yet, and I probably haven't met who it's going to be. This may not help you as much, but I hope it provides some comfort.. . School spirit I think isn't something you just have or don't have, so much as choose to. I could not care less about football, but is something incredible about engineers, artists, math prodigies and frat boys all coming together to scream that we are the leaders and best. And we are.

I'm in the RC, and I was doing my upper-level language (8 credits) my fall semester. I felt soooo inadequate to others, and it always felt like I was the odd one out. I come from a rural and low-income background, so coming to Michigan was incredibly difficult academically and socially. I always felt like everyone was too rich or too smart to understand me or my struggles. Because I was so focused on my schoolwork, I didn't try to connect with other people, and as a result, I felt very isolated. Something that helped my get through that was group therapy through CAPS. It was nice to be surrounded by others that were also struggling and had the courage to share in a group setting. However, what really helped me was 1) taking a film photography class and 2) exercise. The film photography course (RC arts but open to everyone) introduced me to a new medium to express my problems. The class was very small (8 people), so you become close with the others. I remember the night before the final project the printer wasn't working, so we were all panicking. Our professor called us on the landline phone and a girl from my class was like ""yeah we're fine!!"" but we were actually SOL. Another girl went and bought everyone pints of ice cream to get through the ordeal. That being said, having classmates in a studio setting is a positive bonding experience. Finally, exercise helped me a lot in addressing body image issues. Depression made me gain weight and therefore made me feel worse about myself and as a student, so being able to lose weight helped in that regard.. .

Moreover, the content of 396 is basically at the discretion of the professor teaching the course (last year it was abstract manifolds; this year it's complex analysis) so I'm not sure you can get transfer credit for 396. Also the IBL content (similar to moore method, it's a third of the course) in both 395/396 varies quite a bit each year. Last year the IBL sessions for 395 covered Lie groups; this year they are covering measure theory. Depending on the type of class you took, it might make more sense to pursue transfer credit for 452 or to take 395/396 here. I just suspect that the department is going to be skeptical of giving a transfer student credit for the entire UofM honors track classes, but I could well be wrong about this. If you want a more definite answer, you should email professor Stephen DeBacker, he is the undergraduate program director and runs the honors program.. . International makes the REU almost impossible to due the rules around funding -- the money to run these programs comes from the NSF (part of the government) and they require that their money is used only for US citizens and permanent residents. In general funding for international students is very limited; however, UM might have specific funding for international students that go to UM. You should email about that after you start here. You certainly can solicit research positions from professors, but undergraduates typically do not have enough background.

This thread have quite a few encouraging comments. Putting yourself out there is indeed a good way to make friends, but it only increases the chance in which you meet a person that you can connect with. If that probability is already small, and the kind of persons you wish to meet are not those who would put themselves out there as well, then it is unlikely doing so yourself would yield any substantial results. Meeting such persons depends a lot on luck and other elements that are frequently beyond our control; it is the unfortunate fact. Again, this is based on my personal experiences, so if might be different for you. The most downvoted comment does have a point. The entity a person can rely on most is often himself (please tolerate my pronoun use) in the absence of family and other supports, though sometimes I question this statement myself. It is not the most desirable outcome and not entirely sustainable, but at times is the only option available. However, things may change in the future, so it is best if you are able to take care of yourself now so you can take advantage of changes later. . . It ultimately comes down to what kind of friends you want to make, I shall again use myself as an example. . . The people I wish to associate with is rather specific. I do not enjoy the company of most personalities, hence most my horizontal relations are acquaintances. None of my closest friends I have today are made through communities, or perhaps I should say we did not become friends because of the social activities and clubs commonly proposed in the other comments. I literally have known them for two years as mere acquaintances until some unpredicted event changed the nature of those relations. For my case, attending these events produces extremely low yields, as I am in quite a few clubs and only this once did something desirable derived from it. There is still an incentive to try as however low the possibility may be, there is still a possibility. . . In summary, your preferences of friends determines the process and its difficulty through which they obtained. If you need a really good friend, it's based more or less on coincidences. If not, then you can use effort to make many people of different personalities your friend. If your current circumstance resemble more of the former, then it would be best for you to do whatever is best for yourself (study hard, healthy habits) and wait patiently. . .

However, there were definitely other students in both of those classes who had not taken STATS 406 who did well in them. As long as you have familiarity with programming R is not going to be too foreign to you they teach you all of the basics in those classes at the very beginning. They also teach you throughout the course of the class how to run all of the statistics that you learn in those classes in R.. . In terms of it just teaching you snippets I would say that it doesn't do that any more than any programming class does. They obviously don't cover everything but it teaches you the general structure of functions which allows you to parse pretty much any function you can download in R and understand it. For example, I was able to help my friend (biology major) with problems when she was using a phylogenetic tree package for R in her research despite having never been taught anything about that package with those functions.. . So I guess if you want a deeper understanding take STATS 406, but otherwise I think STATS 413 and STATS 415 would probably be fine on their own.. . Also as a note the textbook that they will recommend to learn R can be downloaded legally in pdf form for free from here: https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/. I found they typically neglected to mention it could be found for free until you had shown up on the first day having already rented or bought it.

t1_eauz0fa,2018-12-01 16:12:53,t3_a1z4on,t3_a1z4on,"I've answered this with my own anecdotes a number of times in the past but it's always worth repeating when this question is asked every year:. . My freshman year I lived in Markley, full of freshman and possible friends, but my hall was full of frat bros and pot heads - not my type at all. My roommate was from India and friendly enough, but he had his friends from India, and also kept a very strange sleep schedule (4pm to midnight was his normal night sleep). It meant I couldn't have people over to my room.. . The entire first semester I spent struggling through classes and establishing a study schedule for myself, and on top of that I hadn't met many people. I also spent way too much time playing World of Warcraft leading a raid group. The only good friends I had made up to that point were from a backpacking trip I did through the backpacking club.. . Second semester I wanted to change my social life - I still didn't like to go out and party much, but I did make a point to text people whether they wanted to catch dinner, or do something. Essentially I became the guy who would plan get togethers, small or large, and tell people to invite their friends too. Even hanging out with my high school friends who went to UMich I was able to meet a bunch of new people who became friends too. So tip 1: don't expect people to invite you to things. Most people suck at planning, don't have time, or just don't care enough. Become the planner and inviter.. . Do sports and clubs. There is an IM free agency. If you like sports, be sure to play at least one a semester. It's a good way to break up the week and meet new people, and if you're particularly good at a sport your teammates will love you. My second semester of freshman year I started a club - this is probably the crowning achievement of my time at UMich and also the place I met the most close friends that I will be hanging out with when I'm 90 years old. If you have something you're passionate about, join a club or start a club on the subject.. . DO NOT GIVE UP. By the end of freshman year, I was pretty happy with my friends I had made, but still felt like I could have more. I volunteered as a move in maker at North Quad just so I could move in early (I moved in late to Markley and felt like the friend groups had already been established and that's why I missed out...). This was a great decision because I got to move everyone from my floor in. The group of friends who moved in on my floor absorbed me into their group, and that was my main group of friends through today.. . Now I lead a DnD campaign for some of those friends from North Quad, we play a 12 man fantasy football season every year, get everyone together multiple times per year (even though we have international members), and I met my now fiance through that group of friends.. . This probably sounds like a humblebrag, but I just want to reiterate: I felt like my social life was hopeless by the end of my first semester at UMich. Become the planner. Be passionate about something and join (or start) a club on the subject. Be proactive and put yourself in the correct situations to make friends. It may take another semester or three, but you will get there. There are thousands of people on campus, and I guarantee many feel like you right now too.",2.0,error,0.0

COE only accepts credits for physics, chemistry, and math for pre-reqs. They also accept CS, but none of those classes are requirements so it isn't very useful. However, the other stuff (including unrelated things like lit and gov) can all count for distribution requirements/intellectual breadth. The number of credits you need for intellectual breadth depends on what you plan on majoring, and the exact number can be calculated from this website:. . [https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/ug-ed/reqs/](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/ug-ed/reqs/). . If you don't want to pay upper level tuition, I suggest you find out if you have enough AP credit for the pre-reqs and the intellectual breadth. If you don't have enough, then I would just take AP classes so that you have exactly to fulfill the intellectual breadth, but not more, plus any pre-req AP classes. This total should be less than 55, so you most likely won't pay upper level tuition until second semester of your freshman year.",6.0,neutral,0.6542243957519531

I thought that the waitlists would be shorter now that EECS apparently has limited the number of EECS courses you could enroll in and all that, but at this point they're still long, but for only particular classes, which was the part I thought was strange.. .

I'm somewhat interested in robotics anyway, but it seems like a lot of work if I also want to take 494 (which might take better advantage of my artistic skillset).
