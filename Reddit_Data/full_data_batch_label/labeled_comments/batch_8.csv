Numbers out of S. Korea - which are the current benchmark for accurate reporting - indicate that those in the traditional student age group have essentially a 0% fatality risk. So UMich students - with a few exceptions - are not at risk. While there are certainly some professors and staff who are at-risk, it's far easier to simply quarantine the emeritus professor who can deliver their lectures from home via the Internet.. .

I'm writing tonight to share a brief but important message regarding undergraduate course grading policies for the Ann Arbor campus for the remainder of the winter term.. . Due to the unique academic and personal challenges our students are experiencing this semester in regard to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all undergraduate courses will transition to an alternative grading policy in which faculty enter traditional letter grades, but students receive either ""Pass,"" or ""No Record Covid"" on their permanent transcripts.. . Students who receive a ""Pass,"" or ""P,"" will receive the full course credit. The grade cut-off for a ""P"" will be the same as the traditional grade minimum for students to receive course credit, which is a C-.. . Students who are interested will be able to request that their ""P"" for a course be converted to a letter grade through a process that will be described in greater detail in the weeks to come. Such requests must be made by July 1.. . Students who receive ""No Record Covid,"" or ""NRC,"" will receive no course credit, but their grade point average will not be affected. Language will be added to transcripts explaining the university's policy this term.. . This new policy also applies to undergraduates enrolled in graduate courses, but would not apply to classes graded before March 10.. . Lastly, the university will institute a more flexible withdrawal policy, allowing students to withdraw from a course up until April 21 and not have the course appear on their transcript.. . We plan to share additional information regarding graduate and professional coursework grading policies next week.. . While other institutions across the nation have adopted similar policies on grading, it is undoubtedly an unprecedented step for the University of Michigan. But these are unprecedented times, and I appreciate your flexibility.. . You should expect to receive additional information and guidance from your school or college next week. In the meantime, remember that https://coronavirus.umich.edu/ is our hub for all news and updates regarding the ongoing COVID-19 situation.. .

t1_fl3bfpm,2020-03-21 07:37:05,t1_fl2lxjx,t3_fm542b,"Pass/Fail at Umich typically means if you receive a 70% or above (C-), you get a P grade, meaning you passed the class and thus earn credit for doing so. If you earn below a C-, you will earn an F, and will not earn credit for the class. Both grades would appear on your transcript, but your GPA would not be affected by either grade. Under the current Coronavirus provision, you still need a C- to earn a P, but if you earn lower than a C-, you will earn an NRC grade, rather than an F, which signifies the unforeseen circumstances that may have impacted academic performance this semester. . . As far as pro's and cons go... If you are excelling in a course and earn what you deem to be a good grade (Probably like a B+/A- or higher in most people's minds), definitely elect to unmask the grade. If you aren't doing so well in a course (maybe lower than a B-), I'd recommend you elect to keep the class P/NRC as is the new default. Now in the event that it's nearing the end of the semester and you are positive you will earn lower than a C-, I would recommend going through the late withdrawal process since this new policy allows you to do so up until April 21 without having a W on your transcript (an extremely generous accommodation tbh). Competitive grad schools will likely prefer that students have their grades unmasked, but this is an extremely unique and challenging time we are in. They will understand if you have a class or two that is masked and has a P grade next to it in your transcript, especially if your grade point is otherwise good.. . Where decision making is probably most difficult right now is with regards to classes where you may have right around a B. It's really not at all a bad grade, but given this policy, you might elect to have it masked so that it doesn't impact your GPA. That being said, the masking may unfortunately lead to inevitable suspicion on behalf of applicant reviewers. They may just assume that all P's are masking C-'s, and not B's. There's sadly not a lot we can do about this, though. So my recommendation would be to draw a line for yourself as to where you wanna elect to unmask your grades. My guess would be that for most, the line would be at a B+, but that's a determination people are going to have to come to themselves.

UM also has higher rigor and prestige than MSU, which is not that important if you get a high GPA at MSU but nonetheless it's something med school adcoms look at.

The overwhelming feeling that I got was that everyone in this school just came from a different background than me. It's important to note that the vast majority of students at Umich are from well-to-do families, they've had piano lessons since they were 5 and their K-12 education involved things like robotics clubs and national level academics resources. They're talented at graphic design or mathematics or they've been set up to be a doctor since they were 12. People are the children of physicians and high end 'business consultants' and professors and whatever else. I did not feel like these were my people or this was my place.. . At the end of my time at Umich, I still felt this way. But I really grew to appreciate my time there. I loved just exploring the city, finding the small niches that I enjoyed like live shows at the bars downtown and the weird extracurricular classes that not many people take. I got a co-op job in Ypsilanti that I really liked, and I made some friends in my cohort. It was nice. I still never felt I fit in with the student body - but that's okay, because I carved out my own niche. . . . . So to answer your question, it's hard to sum it up. The culture is, and I'll stand by this despite what people might say, it's a lot of students who seriously have no idea how lucky they had it growing up. Does this make the student body bad or mean or competitive or anything? Absolutely not. There are nice people and there are not-so-nice people just as there are in real life. The city of Ann Arbor is really what you make of it, and nothing beats walking around at night after everyone has gone to bed.. . . .

Circuits classes easier than EECS circuit classes, mechanics classes easier than MechE classes, and pretty nice curves because of all the premeds to round it out. If you want to do something engineering related and struggle in BME classes, engineering is probably not for you. There are a few weeder classes but they're the same ones you need for med school minus 140 and 240. Also, the department just did a curriculum redesign that makes the requirements a lot more relaxed and if you transfer in now you get to take advantage of it. Sounds perfect if you have a very specific focus in BME and want to avoid most unrelated classes outside of the core. . .

If you are currently living without a roommate in West Quad, South Quad, or North Quad, there's nothing you need to do: you will remain in your current assignment.. If you are sharing a room in one of these buildings, you will be assigned a room of your own in that same building.. If you are not living in one of these three buildings, a new housing assignment will be emailed to you on Wednesday afternoon.. We recognize that relocating at this moment in the term is not ideal and we thank you for your understanding and support as we put these necessary measures into place. This consolidation of our student population in the residence halls will also allow us to make sure you are receiving the best services possible during this challenging time; and will allow us to use other residence hall facilities to support emerging needs of Michigan Medicine for respite housing for their staff members providing vital health care to our community.. The email that you receive on Wednesday will outline the process for your move. It will begin with boxes being dropped off at your Community Center for you to begin packing. To make this move as easy as possible, we have hired a moving company and they will be picking up your belongings and delivering them to your new room assignment at no cost to you.

Obviously if you're immunocompromised or something like that, that's whatever, I'm concerned with the overall stats. If you're immunocompromised, you should be going home, communal (dorm) house definitely is not safe.. . 2. Michigan hospital is big, but we are seeing wayyy larger infection numbers than anything the hospital can house. It's likely these dorms will be used for overflow. . . 3. ""Best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, second best time is now"". The number of infected in the US is still following an exponential curve, it would be more hazardous to move people in even just a week (we just broke 40k cases in a day worldwide for the first time today). Remember how harmless this all felt just 2 weeks ago? Now we're on an exponential curve, so the jump to 2 weeks from now will be even worse than the jump from 2 weeks ago (assuming our preventative measures have no effect). . . By increasing the holding capacity for the hospital, you can help reduce strain on hospitals, which is the biggest worry. People are recovering, when they get hospital care. We need to make as much room for the hospitals as possible so that if the curve isn't flattened enough, it isn't as bad, if that makes any sense lol.. . It's very obvious that the hill dorms can be used as overflow, probably for the less critical cases and they will expand their ICU sector or something? I'm not sure how feasible that is though, to expand the ICU.. . https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56. . Highly recommend reading.

Obviously hindsight is 20/20, but I'm pretty sure we've all seen the ted talk bill gates gave years ago about pandemics being the biggest threat to us, well now it's happening.. . There are 50k ICU spots in the US. 50k! If they can repurpose markley and open up a few hundred ICU spots in their main hospital wing or whatever, that's a huge difference.

Health professions schools (i.e. medical, dental, pharmacy, PA, PT, OT etc.) are aware that decisions are being made by colleges and universities and are working to come up with guidelines for handling pass/fail grades being issued because of the difficulties caused by the pandemic. Except for Harvard Medical School (see below), as of today, 3/23/2020, Pre-Health Advisors are not aware of any definitive policy statements having been made by these programs, but based on an assessment of preliminary statements it seems likely that some accommodations will be made in recognition of the prevailing, extraordinary circumstances. However, these schools will still need to assess any applicant's capacity to succeed in their program. Therefore, my recommendations are:. . The wisest strategy you can follow is to continue to make the best grades you can this term, in case you are required to unmask those grades by your chosen health professions schools.. . Your entire record matters most. Even if you end up making a lower grade than you might have gotten under normal circumstances, it is likely but not certain that some understanding will be extended, provided there's sufficient evidence of strength elsewhere in your record.. Note that as of 3/20/2020 students can withdraw from classes as late as April 21, 2020.. . Our experience with medical school admissions committees has shown that they are made up of thoughtful people who understand nuance and context. The hope is that they will judge student performance in the winter of 2020 within the context of the extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in. . . From Harvard Medical School Special Notice Regarding Winter/Spring 2020 Grading. . The Office of the Committee on Admissions at Harvard Medical School recognizes that plans to complete pre-requisite coursework have been impacted immensely by schools' decisions to move to an online instruction model given the current realities of the COVID-19 pandemic. While HMS has always assessed pre-requisites based on the grades given by colleges/universities, we understand that many colleges/universities are emergently creating policies in which all spring 2020 courses will be graded on a pass/fail scale. So that no applicants are disadvantaged by policy decisions made by their colleges/universities as a result of this unprecedented event, HMS will accept pass/fail grading for spring 2020 coursework provided it is the policy of the college/university to only award pass/fail grades.""",16.0,error,0.0

It's more studying and work than most LSA majors for sure unless your in some premed sorta stuff, that is my opinon but I think a lot of ppl will agree. It's also hard because its so popular and there are extremely smart kids in the program, and your just sitting on a bell curve, only the most dedicated get As. Also Idk how much your heart is set on CS, but I would maybe look up some tutorials and stuff and try writing a little program to see if you like it. Also take the EECS intro class for LSA students (EECS 183). I loved that class, and even if you don't end up doing CS that class is great.. . Also I want to mention that your LSA honors prolly won't help you that much in CS, but I know they have dorms and shit so that could be fun to meet like minded ppl. I wouldn't stress if you don't hear back.. . Some shit I learned was that ppl are gonna say that you have time to decide about your major and stuff and you don't need to pick right away, which is true, but tbh it does kinda matter in CS. A lot of kids come in knowing they for sure want to do CS, and just go really hard on CS classes sometimes getting to 281 by their second semester, which can really help with internships and stuff, so def take 183 first sem. Also idk if you have any coding experience but I've been hearing from friends that it's getting significantly easier to test out of engin 101 and 183 if your a freshman. Idk if more ppl are learning about that option or they are letting more kids test bc they have too big classes.. . This brings me to my last point that the CS dept. at umich is super overwhelmed. For some reason they pay most of their lecturers like shit and don't have many of them. Most of the education you'll receive will be from instructional aids (smarter students than you who are paid) and will be highly impersonal, which I really hate, bc the school is getting a ton of kids that wanna do CS and the major is exploding without the infrastructure to handle the growth (teachers and buildings). That being said the profs are for the most part amazing, but overworked imo. So if you do have offers from other schools with lit CS programs that actually pay their lecturers (Cali, waterloo, CM, etc) I would definitely look into them especially if your out of state.. . Thats my two cents on the topic and I know hella other CS kids lurk in here and hopefully they critique me, but I'm CS LSA so I thought I'd respond.. . Edit: read post history, don't go to vandy. Michigan has Big Ten Sports, tailgates, prolly better recruiting, more nightlife. Thats why I love Umich, that and my CS squad, they will be my friends for life, kids in CS at Umich are all friends and a great community. You can be in a lab hear someone working on same project as you lean over and ask them a question and will instantly help you and strike up a connection. Also we ranked higher in CS and all the kids I know that went to vandy paid to get in there and weren't that smart, just sayin",13.0,error,0.0

While understanding Calculus is essential to the practice of engineering, being able to derive the closed form indefinite integral of arccosecant is not a particularly useful life skill even in a highly quantitative field. Someone already did that, wrote it down and you can go look it up.. . The second is that modern high school students are dumb as bricks. It's not just that they don't know they're ignorant but they don't really know how *not* to be ignorant. Your average UMich student probably didn't work all that much in high school. Their native intelligence was sufficient to excel in the listen-and-regurgitate style of teaching so prevalent today compared to peers that varied from hopheads to dunderheads.

Tuition is part of how the university calculates your ""cost of attendance,"" and cost of attendance drives how need-based aid is distributed. That is governed by federal policies.. . If the university resets winter 2020 tuition to be cheaper, that changes the cost of attendance for every student on campus. Suddenly students on aid are eligible for less aid that has been handed out. They would have to repackage everyone's aid and student might have to pay back some of their loans right away, and/or return some grant money. I don't think they would have to return their work study wages, but the University might have to pay back the feds for their share.. . It also means that tuition that gets charged to federal research grants (like when a grad student works in a lab as part of their research assistantship) is no longer accurate. They'd have to change that too and refund some money back to the grant.. . You might be asking yourself, ""but they refunded housing! Why doesn't refunding housing change cost of attendance?"" That's because no one is saying that you stopped eating or needing shelter; you've stopped paying the University of Michigan for those things, and it's assumed that money will continue being spent, it's just being spent off campus. . . The federal government could declare ""we will not make colleges refigure everything, we'll just pretend that everything is square."" If they do that, this could remove one of the big hassles related to retroactively discounting tuition. That doesn't mean that there aren't other considerations though.. .

If there is one thing I have learned from the applications process, it's that acceptances are essentially a crapshoot. I got rejected by UPenn, but waitlisted for UChicago, which is much higher ranked. On the other hand, I got waitlisted for Case Western Reserve, but accepted into URochester and UMichigan. . . It doesn't really make much sense if you look at the national rankings! It's possible that from your daughter's application, the admissions committee gathered that she's unlikely to go somewhere around the Midwest. UMichigan values focus on majors very heavily. It's possible your daughter's ECs just didn't line up with her major in a way admissions found appreciable. There's also the possibility that admissions straight up did not like your daughter's personal statement/supplements. There are a lot of factors at play here, and admissions are pretty unpredictable.. . Nonetheless, look to the bright side! Waitlist isn't a total rejection.

My guess is that your daughter didn't write a compelling 'why Michigan' statement, especially given you said she didn't even want to go to Michigan in the first place. It's a really competitive school, and people don't stress this enough, but numbers don't necessarily mean what people think they do. Of course, those scores are very important, but I don't think they themselves buy you admissions to a competitive school. Honestly, I can't think of a single competitive school that wouldn't be willing to reject a 1600 SAT if their application was weak.. . Instead, I would encourage you to view admissions at these schools somewhat like the British university system, where a certain test score qualifies you to apply for a given school. I mean this literally: if you don't get a certain score on your IB tests in the UK (the international equivalent of the AP), you actually can't even apply to schools like Cambridge or Oxford. Like, they won't look at your application. This means their actual 'applicant' pools are significantly narrowed, and decisions from that point forward are based on essays and interviews rather than academic scores. I think competitive admissions in the US is kind of like this. The test score is the foot in the door, but the essays - and to some extent, the extracurriculars - are what actually makes the admissions counselor decide whether they want to let you in. . . As my old professor told me, nine times out of ten, when someone complains about getting unfairly slighted by a college/job/etc., it's because they wrote a weak essay/cover letter/etc. (I include in this myself, and some of the truly atrocious essays I wrote for some of the colleges I got rejected from.). . And, to reiterate what others have said, I don't think there's any way coronavirus had anything to do with it. Most decisions were made well before anything started changing on campus, and, besides, even if standards were changing, they'd likely let *more* kids in, as they're anticipating more rejections and will want to keep the freshman class size steady.",3.0,neutral,0.7449299097061157

When I applied, I didn't have anything besides the typical summer jobs a high school or college student would have (lifeguard was one) and it was fine.. . If you really want to hit the ball out of the park you could try getting a job as a dental assistant. This would get you hands-on experience in the field and also likely double-count as shadowing hours, which every school requires. Michigan required 100 when I applied. Unless you know a dentist willing to help you out, it may be slightly difficult because most dentists want to hire long-term assistants as the position takes time to train and can impact office production. I would say that's probably the ""best"" job in the sense it will teach you about the day-to-day of dentistry and give you something to talk about during interviews, but again, I wouldn't stress about it.",1.0,neutral,0.6159031987190247

IF you decide to go outside for any reason, once you get home ALMOST ALL people won't sanitize the cloaths and all the objects that they bring with them. I mean, how could they? It's not like everyone should start pouring alcohol on all the things they get in contact with. A new analysis found that the virus can remain viable in the air for up to 3 hours, on copper for up to 4 hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel up to 72 hours. This study was originally published in the preprint database[ medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf) on March 11, and now a revised version was published March 17 in [The New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973). . . But there is a way better way to deal with this problem and I will explain how to sanitize any object or thing under 1 MINUTE. The simple answer is UV light.. . Because UVC rays have the shortest wavelength, and therefore highest energy, they are capable of killing bacteria and viruses, also called pathogens. UVC light has a wavelength of between [**200 and 400 nanometers**](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51914722) (nm). It is highly effective at decontamination because it destroys the molecular bonds that hold together the DNA and RNA (**COVID-19**) of viruses and bacteria, including ""superbugs,"" which have developed a stronger resistance to antibiotics.. . A study that included 21,000 patients who stayed overnight in a room where someone had been previously treated found that sanitizing a hospital room with UV light in addition to traditional methods of cleaning cut transmission of [**drug-resistant bacteria by 30%**](https://medicine.duke.edu/medicinenews/duke-study-finds-uv-light-can-aid-hospitals-fight-wipe-out-drug-resistant-superbugs).. . This is partly because UVC light can effectively sanitize hard-to-clean nooks and crannies. UVC light also works by destroying the DNA of pathogens, which makes it effective against ""superbugs."". . ***But is it safe for humans?***. . **Well, no and yes...**. . The reason why UV Light is not recommended for people to use is because of their spectrum's wavelength of over 300 nanometers (here we are talking about huge machines used in hospitals that cost $65 000). This is why **World Health Organisation (WHO)** has said that UV light is not recommended for skin because it can cause irritation.. . Recently, however, researchers have been working with narrow-spectrum UVC rays (**207-222 nm**). This type of UVC light kills bacteria and viruses without penetrating the outermost cell layer of human skin.. . A [**2017 study**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5552051/) showed that **222 nm UVC** light killed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria just as effectively as a 254 nm UVC light, which would be toxic to humans. This study was [**repeated in 2018**](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/can-uv-light-fight-spread-influenza) on the H1N1 virus, and narrow-spectrum UVC light was again found to be effective at eliminating the virus. This has particularly important implications for public health since the possibility of non-toxic overhead [**UV lighting in public spaces**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w) could **drastically reduce the transmission of diseases and keep you and your family safe.**. . ***What does this mean for you?***. . It means that for example, you can go buy groceries carefree and once you come home, you can sanitize your clothes and any other items you suspect that might contain the coronavirus on them.. . Killing bacteria and viruses with UV light is particularly effective because it kills germs regardless of drug resistance and without toxic chemicals. It is also effective against all germs, even newly-emerging pathogen strains.. . ***How to use a UV light to kill germs at home***. . **Sanitizing wands** allow you to wave UVC light over anything you might want to disinfect, including counters, bedding, and steering wheels. The wands can be used anywhere, claim to work within seconds, and are often marketed to people that are concerned about things like **sanitizing objects like your clothes, phone and any other object in their surroundings**.. . So even though you don't trust the safety of UV light for your skin, although the science is very clear (and yes, almost always is better to rather wash your hands), you can use the UV light to sanitize for all objects in your house and around you.. . ***How?***. . A [**2014 study**](https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(14)01086-4/abstract?cc=y%3D) tested the efficacy of a [**very popular portable wand**](http://coronavirus.trainlives.com/) and found that it killed [**100% of commonly-found bacteria and viruses**](https://www.berkeleywellness.com/self-care/over-counter-products/article/sanitizing-wands-do-they-really-kill-germs) within **5 seconds** and inactivated 90% of spore-forming bacteria and viruses like **COVID-19**, which are harder to kill, within **40 seconds**.",1.0,error,0.0

From what I've seen so far, people in my classes are really smart. But in terms of like cutthroat Ill-give-you-the-wrong-answers-on-purpose type competition, I haven't really seen that thus far. I don't know anything about the application stats.. . * Is it hard to get the classes you want?. . I had some IB credit coming in, so I got a *slightly* earlier registration date which may have helped me out. But I've been able to get into the classes I needed/wanted pretty fine! If you're really in a pickle with your schedule, there can be ways around it like begging for overrides or talking to the professor, **depending on the class.**. . * How hard is it to get research opportunities beginning your freshmen year? Would I be able to start in a research lab at the medical center?. . Tons of labs, just have to ask around! I mean I can't really answer whether you'll be able to research at the medical center. If they take you, you can. If they don't, sorry. But this summer I will be doing research at the medical center actually!

Short answer, yes. UROP is not a prerequisite for anything, it's just an easy way to get your foot into the world of research as a newbie since you're basically guaranteed a project. I did UROP. I didn't like all the seminars and extra assignments. You do not need UROP, but it definitely helped me by holding my hand through the whole process and teaching me how research works and, yes, getting me a project.. . . . * How hard is it to get other pre-med extra curricular opportunities like shadowing and volunteering?. . Very variable on the individual. Having family/friend connections to physicians would help, but not necessary. Volunteering at Michigan medicine is pretty popular, though there is a first come first serve application process. If you don't volunteer here, there are other places!! (VA hospital, St. Joes...). . * Is the pre-med advising helpful since there is so many students?. . Some are notoriously better (Dr. Brawn) than others. I'll admit there tends to be a long waiting time to get an appointment. I have had one premed advising appointment with Dr. Brawn, and it was pretty insightful and helpful.. . * How many students from Michigan undergrad tend to be accepted at the Michigan medical school?

Can't speak to this.. . * Do you have to apply to be a part of clubs like at Penn or is it more relaxed to join clubs?. . In general it's pretty relaxed. So so so many different orgs to choose from! Unless you're tryna get into those Ross orgs which have a pretty brutal application process from what I've heard.. . * How hard is it to get into honors? How do I apply and when?. . Do you mean LSA honors college? I'm not in that sorry. I have no clue about the deadline. But if you want like to graduate with honors that's a whole different thing. Major- dependent.. . . . * Do any of you regret your decision, why?. . No :) Michigan has given me so so so many opportunities that I would never have imagined. So much research around you, great professors, especially in chemistry. I've met some great people, and am surrounded by so many great minds in my classes. On a side note, if you're used to being the smartest in your HS or whatever, pls chuck that expectation out of the window lol. Everyone was as well. You are now a small fish in a big pond. Reference: personal experience. . . * Finally, why did you choose Michigan for pre med?. . I am in state, so UM was my top choice. Obviously, there is the choice of going to another in state school that is notoriously less difficult to keep your pre med journey a little less intense/ competitive/ keep your GPA afloat. However, I knew UM classes would prepare me insanely well for the MCAT and just life in general. Profs for many of the science classes are pretty renowned in their fields. But yes, the classes *will be hard.* Very much a work hard-play hard culture. The people I see around me motivate me to push myself more.. . The opportunities are also a lot more at your finger tips as well. (LOL this made me remember the time we had to design an experiment to carry out in Orgo 2 lab, and someone asked about the budget on the worksheet to buy reagents, the prof literally said, ""just keep it in mind but don't worry about the budget."") You just have to reach out and find them. It's a gigantic school and no one will be there to walk you through things and mentor you step by step like you might get at a small school, which wasn't necessarily an issue for me. . .

I honestly have noticed little competition here, people are generally nice and helpful.

[https://careercenter.umich.edu/article/um-graduates'-medical-school-application](https://careercenter.umich.edu/article/um-graduates'-medical-school-application). . \- Is it hard to get the classes you want?. . For pre med classes, not really. They are very large classes that don't generally run out of space in my experience. It can be difficult to get into other smaller classes at any time, but there are so many options that usually you can easily find something else to fulfill a requirement if necessary.. . \- How hard is it to get research opportunities beginning your freshmen year? Would I be able to start in a research lab at the medical center?. . \-Would labs accept me if I don't do UROP?. . I'm going to lump these two together. As long as you are diligent, it is not that difficult. As someone who did UROP, I'm not sure exactly how difficult it is to get into a lab without it, but I would consider doing UROP, it was helpful for me. Otherwise, you just have to email a lot of labs (10-20+) and show genuine interest in their research. Many people are interested in hiring freshmen.. . \- How hard is it to get other pre-med extra curricular opportunities like shadowing and volunteering?. . If you have a car, super easy. If you are limited to resources on campus, a little more difficult but absolutely possible. Throughout my time here I have volunteered at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital and Hope Clinic, because I was able to drive off campus. My friends who looked for opportunities on campus have volunteered at UM Hospital and Ronald McDonald House. There are also TONS of other opportunities.. . \- Is the pre-med advising helpful since there is so many students?. . In my experience, yes. It's not difficult to get an appointment, but you may have to wait a week or more at busy times. There are also walk-in advising appointments every week where you don't need an appointment. They work very hard to be accessible.. . \- How many students from Michigan undergrad tend to be accepted at the Michigan medical school? Is it higher than average?. . Yes, it is higher than average. That said, they only accept 177 people total, so it is safe to say they only take the best of the best from UM, so it is still very very difficult. I would not base your college decision about your possibility of getting into the med school here.. . \- Since I'm OOS would I still be at a disadvantage when applying to Michigan medical school even if I do my undergrad at Michigan?. . Yes you would, but there would still be a consideration for doing your undergrad here. I stand by what I said above on this too.. . \- Do you have to apply to be a part of clubs like at Penn or is it more relaxed to join clubs?. . Some clubs you apply to, some just accept everyone. There are a ridiculous number of clubs here, so I'm positive you can find a few you would like to join. I personally don't participate in clubs so I am not an expert here by any means.. . \- How hard is it to get into honors? How do I apply and when?. . I am not sure, but you will definitely get emails about it so no worries on not hearing about applying. I don't think it's overly difficult but again, I'm not sure.. . \- Do any of you regret your decision, why?. . No, I do not regret my decision. There are things I wish I knew before coming, especially that this school is HARD. It takes vastly more time to study for exams now than in high school, and many of the pre med classes are set up with an average grade of a B-. If you come here you are accepting that your GPA will likely be lower. Besides that, UM is an amazing place with amazing people and opportunities and it is definitely where I feel I belong.. . \- Finally, why did you choose Michigan for pre med?. . I chose UM because it made me feel better that it was a big name and that everyone would know what I was talking about when I said I was going here. I also felt the research opportunities would be much more abundant here than other smaller schools, which has held up to be true.. . If you have any more questions, please feel free to reach out!

Do you have to apply to be a part of clubs like at Penn or is it more relaxed to join clubs?. . -Maybe some but plenty you don't have to. . How hard is it to get into honors? How do I apply and when?. . -I just had to write an additional essay. Last date to apply for this fall is April 7 https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/applytohonors/deadlines-requirements/. . Do any of you regret your decision, why?. . -Definitely not, classes for tough but I was well prepared for the MCAT and did well. There are so many opportunities, you just have to take the initiative to take advantage of them.. . Finally, why did you choose Michigan for pre med?. . -I'm in state, so to go to one of the top public schools in the country for in state tuition was a no brainer. . edits: formatting",1.0,error,0.0

t1_fltdq63,2020-03-29 07:55:11,t3_fr0bir,t3_fr0bir,"Congrats on your acceptance! Honestly speaking, the premed track at Umich is pretty tough, especially if you're not coming in as a transfer and thus don't have any core credits to bring over. The early biology, statistics, physics, and chemistry classes required for premed students here are widely considered ""weeder"" classes. Essentially, they are classes that shouldn't be as rigorous and demanding as they are, but are intentionally kept difficult to ""weed out"" premed students. I am one of many students here that I know who has fallen off the premed track, largely because I just \*hated\* the experience I was having in most of these classes. That being said, once you get to higher level content (ie. 300, 400 level courses), the nitpicking tends to noticeably decline, even disappearing in many cases. . . There are a lot of research opportunities available here that you can definitely take advantage of and use to your benefit. I'd advise you look into UROP, especially if you are coming in as a freshman. That will also get your foot in the door in applying to research labs over the next few years.. . I can't speak with complete confidence, but in my experience, grade inflation in general is quite rare in LSA. They do curve grades in some of the chemistry courses you'll be taking, but that is only because the exams are pretty brutal and something like an 85% is understandably deemed an A (ie. the department isn't really doing anyone any favors). In general, Umich is a difficult school, \*especially\* with regards to STEM courses. Even diligent students frequently have a hard time maintaining a 3.5+ GPA. Don't beat yourself up if you're having a hard time. Honestly, classes tend to get easier (in terms of grading) as you move up from the 100's & 200's to the 300's & 400's, so a positive trend in academic performance is quite reasonable to expect in most students putting in the work.. . Professors are pretty hit or miss. I would say the majority are hits, but there are notable exceptions (especially in the statistics department in my experience), who will make your head want to explode. Honestly, your best bet, as always, is to check out 'rate my professor' before registering for a course. If everyone is saying bad things, it's probably not just a one-time disgruntled student... That being said... you will have many GSI's during your time here on a premed track, and this can really be a complete lottery. I've had GSI's who could barely speak English trying to teach microbiology. But then I've also had GSI's who were so on top of everything they were putting the professor to shame. My advice here is to make use of resources like the Science Learning Center and general office hours if you need help and your professor/GSI isn't cutting it. Remember too, that you can often sit in on other professor's lectures in your free time, assuming there's space.. . Umich as a school is pretty competitive, and I'd say that the premed track can somewhat highlight that. People come in knowing that less than half of their peers who say they want to attend medical school will actually go on to do so, and no one wants to believe that they'll be one of the ones that ""doesn't make it."" I think this leads people to really go hard in the first few semesters, to prove themselves if you will. But I think that this does die down as you go through the years here and people start to actually take courses because they're genuinely interested in the material being taught. You do also have a somewhat toxic ""I bet I get less sleep than you"" atmosphere here, especially in the weeks surrounding exams. My advice here, and with all of this, is to just try and find a group of friends or even just study partners who genuinely make you relaxed and feel good. Obviously it's important that you work hard, but don't surround yourself with people who just stress you out. You'll be stressed out enough already.",-2.0,error,0.0

But it's really a lot more than supporting diversity within the U of M community, plus you don't get into the program on the basis of race. So far my experience with CSP has been amazing. First semester of my freshmen year I took CSP 101 with Keith Jason, an absolutely amazing advisor through the CSP program. It was a 1 credit course that went over everything from study skills, to how to build your resume, and practicing health and wellness while at college. If you're ever looking to fill your schedule with an easy mini course that is worth your time-- I would highly recommend. You'll get your own advisor through the CSP program which may seem excessive at first but it's extremely helpful especially when registration begins and advisors start to get booked for appointments. I also prefer my CSP advisor to my Newnan advisor, she's been super down to earth, helpful, and compassionate throughout my first year. CSP also offers a ton of free support through the program. Students are offered free tutoring for a variety of subjects, which I found super useful for when I took Stats 250. Not to mention CSP students get priority for certain programs like UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program) and also for CSP sections of certain classes. Currently I am in the CSP section of Biology 171, my professor Cynthia Giffen is hands down one of the best instructors I have ever had in my life. CSP sections tend to be smaller and may move through material differently than the typical sections do. I find this to be very helpful especially coming from a smaller high school, my lecture is around 80 people. We also meet for an extra day of discussion unlike the normal sections, which has been such a benefit for me in regards to retaining the material, but this isn't the case for all CSP classes. You'll also find that your CSP sections will be more diverse than your typical classes, the classroom environment overall is a positive and accepting place. I've made some great friends in my CSP courses and it's definitely made my undergraduate experience a heck of a lot better.

And no one else at my school has gotten into this program. I have a relatively low gpa, but I attribute this to rigor and laziness in highschool, not my background or situation. Is my gpa most likely the reason for my admittance? And would I have not gotten into u of m if it weren't for this program?

I've heard great things about MRADS, too! UROP really boils down to: if you're ok with cold emailing professors/labs without the help of UROP (which was minimal anyways), I'd honestly do that instead. you have a higher chance of getting a lab you like without all the requirements that come with UROP (seminar, monthly meetings, etc).

From what it sounds like you are looking for in a school Michigan is definitely the way to go. Not only are there a crazy number of project teams, but many of them are among the top teams in the world with dozens of trophies to prove it; SolarCar, MASA, MRacing and a bunch of others. . . You also mentioned internships and research. I began in September, went to the career fair less than a month later and had an internship less than a month after that. Obviously some of it falls on you as an individual, but just being a student here at Michigan seems to put you on a hiring hitlist. . . Those two points even kind of mesh together. Michigan student teams are very well known in industry. Top companies come to visit specific project teams regularly to accept resumes and talk to the members. I became a part of MASA pretty much as soon as I got here and in the first 6 months we hosted visits from Blue Origin, Raytheon, and SpaceX and they have hired a rather significant number of our members over the years. Maybe these things are normal, but to be honest I'd never heard of anything quite like it before coming here. . As far as research, every summer you can apply to SURE which is an undergrad research program, complete with a $5000 stipend. I haven't looked into it a whole lot myself, but you can find info online. . . Last thing is just sort of a personal opinion. Moving from California to Michigan, away from family and friends was challenging. On top of that the coursework here is incredibly challenging. I had some really rough patches and at times even regretted coming here, but I know I've grown so much more here than I could have going to a school reasonably close to home. Throw yourself to the wolves I say. There's a reason Michigan is always ranked among the top schools.

I just thought I'd address some of your concerns vis a vis Michigan - . . Working/interning in California - sure, we're not geographically close to Cali, but we've got a MASSIVE network of alums there. Most people from the EE/CE/CS community who want to intern at large tech companies end up in the Bay Area, and they're always willing to help out undergrad students. If you want to boost your chances of working there, all you've got to do is talk to people and expand your network. To sum it up - as far as working/interning in Cali goes, you absolutely don't need to worry, there are tons of opportunities to do that. . . Waitlists - I think that's a fair point you make about waitlist concerns, and I respect that you've done your research thoroughly. That being said, for a CS major, you should have no problem getting into the core classes - EECS 183 (intro programming), EECS 203 (Discrete Math), EECS 280 (intro programming and data structures), EECS 281 (algo. and data structures), EECS 370 (intro comp. Organization) and EECS 376 (CS foundations). Getting into some upper level CS classes (eg. EECS 445 - ML) can be challenging, but if you register as soon as possible, and are persistent with attending lectures and talking to profs while on waitlist (assuming you don't get in right away), you won't have a problem taking the classes you want. I know plenty of people who have never been unable to take a ULCS of their choice. . . Perspectives and diversity - Trust me on this one - if there's any one thing you want to take away from this thread, it's that there's a place for EVERYONE at UMich. No matter what your interests are, you're sure to find like-minded people and make some amazing friends pretty quickly. Socially speaking, I can guarantee you an incredible 4 years, and besides, it's important to talk to different people from backgrounds different than yours once in while :) . .

Although the examples are done alone now, at least the answers can be checked on the slides, so going through the lecture videos and examples should still take roughly an hour, albeit maybe not as fun as in person.. . Some helpful advice as well: For the open office hours period, try asking to go over some examples or grammar if you're unsure. I'm not sure which section you are in, but we asked to go over additional examples and practice slides like the ""normal"" recitation class, so it's like nothing really changed in that sense.

It'll be perfectly livable and respectable, but the horror stories you hear about kids never finding a salary >45k after college largely come from places like that.. . Michigan affords you a better education and more mobility. If you're applying for a job from New York to Cali, the name will be known and you'll be able to find work that isn't largely limited to the state of Michigan. The money will be higher at every point, realistically. . . It's not a guarantee, but that extra cost gets you the Michigan name. That being said -- and keep in mind I say this with a liberal arts degree -- international studies probably doesn't fit into those descriptions because even at Michigan, its advisors will recommend that you double major because IS alone doesn't get you jobs.

I remember being equally concerned about the courseload and so far it's definitely doesn't seem nearly as hard to graduate in 4 years as people make it out to be.

A double-major between CS-LSA and Ross is 158 credits whereas a normal degree is 120 credits so take that as you will. . . I came in with less transfer credit than you and multiple advisors have told me not to worry about missing my graduation time. . . Take what I'm saying with a grain of salt, however, because I take EECS 281 next semester (a notoriously difficult programming class) which will really test whether or not it's doable to keep balance together. . . I wouldn't let other people's comments scare you away from the prospect of double-majoring, but CS, in general, is not an easy-courseload. . .

The success of students in si doesn't really come from si, but the students themselves or other programs. I.e. all the ux students who land good jobs are the ones who put in massive amounts of work outside of classes and go above and beyond to create strong portfolios, a lot of si kids who land strong jobs are Ross dual degrees (all the dual degrees in SI I know attribute their success to their Ross degree and said the BSI was mainly just good in networking and making themselves sound technical) or cs minors/dual degrees (I'm convinced BSI career services purposefully doesn't differentiate dual degrees esp with Ross on their employment reports cause it would drastically drop the ""only BSI major"" salary number).. . In realty, a lot of students in the BSI struggle to land jobs that are anywhere near the salary you said, or get a job in general. Survivor bias is very real when it comes to job hunting in BSI, and well most professional programs at Michigan (cs, Ross for example although BSI definitely skews the most imo). . Edit: a lot of people in BSI, especially on the IA pathway think the classes are a ""scam"" and don't really teach you that much. A lot of the IA kids I've talked to have noticed a lot of SI's hireability comes from companies that are not technically competent and ""drink the kool aid"" when it comes to SI and the amazing ""data science/analytics"" skills students have. In short, a lot of what the first comment said is due to clever tactics by career services and just general circumstances, but by no mean is a good blanket statement for the program actually being as good as it sounds. . Also....getting an 80k job out of college sounds great but what's the career trajectory and growth like?

There are reports 18-20% may be asymptomatic, so you can add in some additional percentage there, and under reported cases can at best get you to probably get to 1% of the US population infected. Where does the virus go after the month of April? Guess what, it's still there.. . The reason things are expected to peak in the next couple weeks, is because of social distancing and mitigation measures put in place a few weeks ago. When these measures are removed, there will again be another wave of infected people. The argument of our heath care system will be better prepared is false. It will be ""slightly"" more equipped, but still running above capacity in the best of cases.. . There are three ways large public gatherings and normalcy will return: 1. A vaccine (12-20 months out) 2. 60% of the population is infected to build herd immunity (in a short time frame the US death toll would likely be >1 mil. which would be an unprecedented and unacceptable amount of causality), 3. Extreme contact tracing, testing, and rolling waves of social distancing/mitigation measures. We will likely be in some form of option 3 until 1 or 2 is reached (whichever comes first). When I say extreme contract tracing, think of China: an app with a color code that officials inspect (and take your temperature) before entering certain places. We are nowhere near that (or likely will ever be..the one benefit of an authoritarian gov't is apparently good pandemic response and control measures..). . The only way to know is to watch China right now, if they open up schools in June or not. And as they continue to slowly open up their economy, what type of outbreaks will occur.

It's a simplified model of course, but I justify the obscene amount of money I've spent (or at least promised to spend) at this university as some combination of (in no particular order):. . * Baseline value of degree to work in my chosen field. . * Image/prestige/networking associated with UM. . * Quality of instruction at UM. . * Experience of going to college in Ann Arbor. . The baseline degree value won't change, but that's the least exclusive thing to the University of Michigan. The image/prestige of the university isn't likely to take a significant hit in the long-term, but many networking opportunities would be lost without the on-campus component. Instructor skill won't likely change, but student engagement will not be as high and courses that involve labs or projects that have physical deliverables aren't going to be the same as students won't have access to the equipment resulting in an ultimately lower-quality educational experience. That's not even to mention the death of any co-curricular activities. And of course the Zoom University experience of being depressed in my parents' attic doesn't hold a candle to a proper year in Ann Arbor. . . Could those losses justify the primary cost of waiting, that presumably being a few months' future earnings? That's a pretty personal question that will depend on both personal circumstances and goals, but I can see the answer for many being yes, especially if there are fears of graduating into a recession.

Pros: All the facilities, appliances, etc. are brand new, it's very nice all around. Very close to campus. Very easy to move-in to, especially if you're an international/OOS student. Close to a main bus route, virtually everything on campus is either a short walk or bus-ride away (I have a car and it's usually faster for me to bus to North Campus even). . . Cons: No windows. Far from grocery stores. If you have a car, you'll either need to do some super weird shit to maneuver the street parking (not worth IMO), or pay for a parking spot that is potentially a 8-10 min walk away. You live with 5-6 other people (potentially a pro or a con). Relatively far if your classes are on North Campus (e.g. Engineering). . .

I did not vote for Bernie Sanders, so I really don't appreciate your portraying me as some leftist strawman.

I've been fortunate enough to keep my on-campus job remotely, I can get by. But it's also undeniable that I'll be coming straight out of college and I'll be paying taxes to bail out virtually everyone in the country except for me, whether those checks go to the people who actually need it or not.. . I'm sorry your home country is suffering from COVID-19, but I really don't see how the response there should dictate US policy. I can mostly only speak to what's happening here. Ten million Americans filed for unemployment in two weeks. Businesses are closed, people aren't working, people aren't getting paid, Most Americans aren't prepared to just handle a month or more's worth of normal expenses without working. Yeah, sending out checks is a weak patch over an unstable, unnecessarily rigid system. But at the same time, the urgency of the pandemic means we didn't really have time to sit around and fix all the underlying problems. . . So what does a better solution look like? Pause rent. Pause mortgages. Pause property taxes. Maybe the government subsidizes loan interest across some large swath of debts - that would be way cheaper than the actual stimulus, it would ease fears about restaurants and other businesses going under just because of quarantine. It's the closest thing to being able to put things on pause and not punish people for loss of business when people staying home is imperative to public health. Nobody loses. Cost to taxpayers would be lower. Those businesses that are essential and need to operate can reroute their rent/lease/mortgage payments to be able to provide hazard pay to the workers who need to work jobs with higher risk of exposure. . .

I withdrew early that semester after failing Exam 1 and retook it twice (fall 2017 and winter 2018), and I ended up with a D- followed by a D+. I spent SO much time in office hours to the point that my grades in the rest of my classes started to dip, and though I aced the homework assignments, there was something about the exams that just killed me every time. I never understood how the class average was so high, either, because I was nowhere near it. I'm a senior now and my GPA never fully recovered after that.. . If you're able to, take MTH 160 at Washtenaw CC over the summer and transfer the credit over. It covers most of the same concepts, but it's SO much easier/straightforward and less time-consuming. Taking it online is honestly the way to go, especially if you won't be nearby during the summer (I went thru the entire process, from applying to WCC to taking the final, without ever having to set foot on their campus). . . I know this was really long-winded but as someone who was once in the exact same boat, I really felt the need to let you know that you're not alone in this. Not all of us are naturally good at these types of classes, and even though it might not feel like it now, I promise it doesn't mean you're dumb or that you don't belong here. I've still been able to ace plenty of higher-level courses and find great research/networking opportunities here despite my crappy GPA, and I have no doubt that you can too.

Pros: very affordable and super convenient. It is \~$990 a month for a single/one bedroom and \~$700-800 for with a roommate, but it includes everything. Water, electric, sewer, trash, and internet. And the internet is extremely fast since it is the university network. There are bus stops very close to all the apartments so commuting to central campus is very fast. Maintenance is also very responsive and get repairs done super fast. Grocery stores and gym are also close by. No security deposit required and I never had to worry about the university housing taking advantage of me.. . Cons: The buildings are pretty old especially with Northwood I, II, and III apartments. There's no central heating/cooling in those buildings. During the summer it can get very hot unless you install a window AC (cost extra to install + electric fees during summer months). When it gets close to winter you will have to wait for the housing team to turn on the boiler for the heater so there might be a couple cold weeks, although if enough people contact housing they will turn it on earlier. Northwood IV and V are relatively new so they do have central heating/cooling, but it is mostly families who live there so you should expect noises from kids. A small number of units might have washer/dryer, but for other ones you have to go to the laundry rooms which can suck during snowy seasons.. . Overall if you are looking for an affordable (not extremely cheap) and convenient place, NW is a good choice.

However, the class takes a LOT of time, especially if you are trying to get an A. I remember spending close to 15+ hours a week, and that's bc I really tried to understand every single Written HW & Web HW problem.

If you really care about the concepts, I'd suggest taking Honors Multivariable Calculus bc it's proof-based and forces you to understand what's going on. The reason why Math 215 is hard is because it is a LOT of material in a short amount of time & students tend to memorize ways of solving a problem rather than conceptually trying to understand the methodology due to the breadth and depth of the course. This coorelates to poor exam scores bc exam questions tend to be questions that you've rarely seen & depend on conceptual understanding.. .

Look into EECS 498 which are these seasonal courses taught by really good professors that mostly do research and they satisfy ULCS reqs.. . 2) Yes they are capped. No it doesn't make it harder since you need 4 to graduate (16 cr) and that means you really just need a year after finishing off the core requirements, which you can do in 2 years easily and 1 possibly.. . 3) This is true if you want one on one help for debugging etc. If you just want to ask some general conceptual/questions the professor usually leaves out some time at the start for everyone. Professors are awesome here and they are willing to go way later than the scheduled OH to help literally everyone on the queue (shout out to Dr. Paloetti). . 4) My experience with advising is they are just professors, and they know what they are talking about. CSE is huge so paperwork done by actual advising office people may take pretty long but they'll get things to you.. . 5) My experience with career fairs is that they are overrated (for CS) and if you have a strong resume you can just apply online. Almost all of the IAs for the core classes landed FANG companies. The hard part isn't getting an interview but passing them, so grinding leetcode is what makes the difference.

Other people can chime in if anything seems not too accurate, but this is what I have experienced.. . 1. I think for some it might be a nightmare getting into upper level CS courses especially if you come in without much AP credits at all. I would say 23 credits should be ok.. 2. I believe that it is capped at 2 classes per semester for everyone and I don't think this makes it necessarily harder to graduate. Most people usually take 2 CS courses per semester anyway and I think a good amount of people are able to finish a CS degree in 3.5 years.. 3. Office hours with a professor from my experience are not bad at all for most courses. I think for most courses, professor office hours are more for conceptual questions so not a ton of people go. Office hours held by instructional aides though are a different beast especially for the core courses that everyone is required to take like EECS 183, EECS 280, EECS 281, etc. I think this is mainly because many people need code debugging help and usually instructional aides are the ones that provide that help so when a project deadline comes near, the office hour queues get extremely long to the point that you do indeed need to wait for hours to get help. In terms of workarounds, there is Piazza which is an online forum, but ultimately getting help from the instructional aides will likely be most helpful as they also have access to the Autograder (project autograding system) and can point you towards where you are going wrong.. 4. I would say the advisors are helpful but I think many CS students don't always go to the advising office for advising on things like which courses to take. Not that they aren't helpful but I think most CS students are aware enough of the requirements that they can figure out what they want to take without any advising help.. 5. I wouldn't necessarily say it's definitely harder to get internships, but I don't know how companies recruit. If companies have a quota for how many people can intern from a certain school then yes I guess it would make it harder, but it seems from my experience this isn't a big factor.

I am an OOS student, but have loved UMich for a long time (Go Blue!) and am super excited to enroll this fall.

Is this true, and if so, is this for just some electives, or across the board? (I have APs that translate to 23 AP credits for calc/physics/chem courses and 3 or 4 other social science electives, so will that help?). * I hear upper level electives are capped at 2 classes per semester. Is it possible to take equivalent graduate level courses as a workaround for this?. * Is it true that you have to wait for hours to get any office hours with a professor/IA? Is this for all the courses, and are there any other ways to get help (like online chats, clubs or study groups that the professors make available)?. * Is it easy to find research opportunities in CS through UROP and is this even a common thing people do?. * Is the SGUS 5-year master's program something worth trying for, and how difficult is it to meet the requirements for it. * Last, since the program size has increased massively, is it harder to get internships? How many people normally can even land internships at the FAANGs or other Big-N companies?. . I was hoping to hear from students actually in the department before I commit (also have Georgia Tech and UCLA as options (also out of state), though I am leaning towards UMich).

I will say that 442 doesn't seem terrible on it's own; my friends have said it's a medium workload and the lack of exams is a plus. However, I will say that this sounds....not fun. 376 is weird to gauge because the difficulty of the class boils down to how good are you at abstract mathematics. Some find it 100% doable and interesting, others find it a slog and boring. I personally found the content interesting but having to go to office hours multiple times per homework made the workload much higher than I expected. The exams are brutal.. . 482 is a huge time sink, as the projects take a long time to finish + you're likely going to be at office hours a lot (my team goes 1 or more times a day). How good your team is factors a lot here. I'm in a good team and I can't imagine how much time 482 would take without them. The exams are similarly brutal (they're 3 written coding questions and you don't get the answer keys to any of the practice exams, just one exam review that goes over the answers for one practice exam).. .

[According to the Ann Arbor News](https://aadl.org/aa_news_19690906-some_foreign_students_get_union_rooms) U-M estimated a 7% drop in the number of students who would apply for dormitory housing in the 1969-70 school year. The actual drop was closer to 2%.. . After incoming students applied for housing in the spring it became clear in June that there would not be enough space for everyone. The university worked over the summer to expand space within existing halls but it was not enough to accommodate everyone that expected housing. They began to set up emergency spaces around campus to temporarily house students in the fall. . . [Over 300 new students arrived to Ann Arbor in the fall of 1969 and were housed in emergency spaces](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754159/65) in the Michigan Union, Michigan League, the West Quad and Markley dining halls, and more. Students lived there while the university waited for rooms to open up by students who never arrived to claim them (which evidently happened at a much higher rate than it does today).. . While in temporary quarters students were encouraged to seek off-campus housing opportunities. In a meeting with displaced students [Leon West, the appropriately named West Quad Building Director, outrageously said ""This University cannot and will not accept the final responsibility for placing you in housing"".](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754159/73) I just can't fathom that. From what I can tell at the time students submitted a housing application and deposit in the spring and then late in the summer (or upon arriving in the fall) were given their specific housing assignment. . . It was a week before students began to get permanent housing assignments. However on [September 19th there were still 126 students living in the temporary spaces](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754159/175). Space was created by adding additional beds to other rooms, turning singles into doubles and doubles into triples. Students in these spaces were offered a $90 reduction in room costs for the year ($950 for a double instead of the regular $1,040).. . Coverage of the issue in The Michigan Daily drops off after the 19th so I am left to assume that remaining students were assigned housing or moved off campus shortly after. [On October 5th there is an article about a study commissioned by housing](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754159/309) to assess space needs going forward.

If you are an average CS student, your GPA is probably not going to be super high, but LSA prereqs are much easier and will boost your GPA. 2. More time on central campus. Being on north campus all the time makes it feel like you attend an institution completely separate from UMich sometimes.

However, some engineering students do not realize this. For example, I have a friend doing IoE who thinks IoE is harder than CS-LSA. Obviously, difficulty is subjective, most people would agree CS-LSA (\~= CS-ENG) is way harder than IoE and dealing with people like this one friend is annoying.. .

I have often had similar thoughts myself. u/antisteveharrin I'd like to respond to a question you posed to dragonship, hopefully you both find this useful.. . >There's two issue with this: the first is that this is bringing a child into the world that is not wanted or there are other complications with pregnancy/birth. What is the point in that?. . I think the conservative counter-argument to this would be that unprotected sex has consequences. This argument falters quite a bit when pregnancy complications or forced pregnancies come into account, but there are many conservatives that would regard those as special exceptions. If it is true that human life begins at conception, or nearly thereafter, then I think it is very difficult to argue in favor of abortion. The risk in having a child would've been assumed at the decision to have unprotected sex, and since no method is 100%, even having sex at all (though the risk is very low with proper precaution so this is not a major issue). An unplanned pregnancy then would be the fault of the individual for not taking proper precaution, and that fault could not and should not be mitigated by the taking of a human life.. . I should add that I am pro-choice, as I don't believe that life begins at conception, but I admit that is a *belief.* It is partially backed by science, but we cannot fully say when life actually begins. It is more of a philosophical question, and even if we were to fully answer it empirically, it would remain a matter of belief for many. I think that is why this is such a difficult issue, and I appreciate u/dragonship2 for acknowledging that. Unfortunately, sex negativity, unequal opportunities, and a failure to acknowledge that abortion would still dangerously occur if outlawed is wrapped in with conservative arguments too. If these things were acknowledged, I think a consensus approach could emerge where abortions are reduced to a minimum through sex education, subsidization of childcare, and provision of womens' healthcare (if not all healthcare). These are also anathema to conservative positions, however, making compromise near impossible.",1.0,positive,0.6131587028503418

t1_fn5pspf,2020-04-12 06:10:35,t1_fn4ly8e,t3_fzilz5,"I think when people argue about whether life begins at conception, they're really thinking about consciousness (which is separate from life itself -- it is trivially simple to argue that life does not begin at conception for any of the popular scientific definitions). The argument of whether consciousness begins at conception boils down to whether you believe your consciousness comes from the structure of your brain (nothing more than the positioning of the various atoms that you are composed of) or whether there is some innate, intangible consciousness separate from your physical body that makes you you (ie a soul). I will argue for the former.. . We know that people who experience serious head injuries can suffer memory loss and undergo extreme changes in personality. We know that humans have considerably more complex physical brain structures than other animals and also have a more complex consciousness that allows us to recognize our existence in a way other animals don't seem to be able to. We know that the animals we consider to be the smartest (dolphins, monkeys) share some similar features in their brain structures that the dumber animals lack. We know that human infants start out with simpler brains that develop over time, and that they also don't start life with a full adult level consciousness, [but rather develop advancing levels of consciousness as they age](http://www.psychology.emory.edu/cognition/rochat/Rochat5levels.pdf). The evidence seems convincing to me that consciousness is tied directly to your physical brain. . . If consciousness is a result of your brain structure, then it's trivial to argue that consciousness does not begin at conception because a zygote does not have any neurons yet, let alone a complex enough brain structure to yield consciousness. . . Lets consider where the opposing argument comes from for a moment. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that consciousness comes from an intangible soul that is divorced from your physical body. This idea stems primarily from religion. We have freedom of religion in America, so I cannot tell anyone that they are not allowed to believe that consciousness is gift from god innate to every human from the time they are conceived. If anyone wants to believe that, they are free to do so, and they are free to not get an abortion if they get pregnant because of their beliefs. However, we have freedom of religion in America, so no one can tell me that I have to follow THEIR religion and believe that consciousness is an innate gift from god to every zygote. It is immoral for anyone to try and prevent someone else from getting an abortion, because then they are forcing their own religious beliefs onto others. . . Additional note: the current legal precedent, set by the Supreme Court, agrees with me. They don't argue on consciousness though -- the most recent precedent, set in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* is based on the scientific definition of life, not consciousness. TL;DR of that argument: by any popular definition of life, a fetus is not alive until it can survive on its own if removed from the womb (this trait is known as viability). States may not restrict women from aborting a nonviable fetus, they may restrict women from aborting a viable fetus.",1.0,error,0.0

When you say popular scientific definition of life I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about. Was there some sort of a science convention where all the biologists defined that viability was an essential trait of life and no arguments were brought up against it? Afaik there wasn't one really so it might be an opinion some hold and something that's in the law but they had to write something so that's what they came up with. Additionally a fetus is considered viable if it can survive outside of the womb and that includes fetuses that can live outside of the womb with artificial aid. As technology improves they will be able to survive outside of the womb for longer and longer periods. Is it safe to say then that life will somehow start earlier? Will external artificial aid replace the womb in this context? Even though I'm not pro-life that doesn't really sit right even with me. On top of that we don't know if a fetus is going to survive outside of the womb before it's you know outside of the womb. In most cases the doctor is the one responsible for determining whether it would or not. If the doctor makes a mistake then is he killing a human being? If he's extra cautious and doesn't abort where he could is he ruining a person's life (maybe 2 people's lives)?,1.0,neutral,0.7081203460693359

t1_fn6i4m4,2020-04-12 13:58:20,t3_fzq4wp,t3_fzq4wp,"Looks like a lot of what you're saying in this post comes largely from two comments I made earlier about BSI (chain here: https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/futari/best_departments_at_um/fmf3cma?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), so I do feel somewhat obligated to respond to this post. . . u/goldfashiononly is absolutely right - you get from the program what you put into it. That being said, I'll add on the following:. . - Absolutely do NOT feel discouraged by what I posted earlier and what others are responding in this thread! The only reason I even decided to ahead and make the comments I did is because of incoming BSI students like you. The program has caught like wildfire amongst underclassmen nowadays (tbh I'm not entirely sure why aside from the program just sounding like a guaranteed way to land a good job lol @ BSI marketing and career services) and I wanted to do my part to help incoming students know some of the BS around them in that regard and the challenges they will face, in that regard. That being said, you absolutely have the power and potential to take control and write your narrative and story about your BSI experience, and be one of those BSI students who lands a killer job out of the program (this is coming from a someone who's doing software engineering at a reputable tech company after graduation, and is not a BSI dual degree with Ross/CS or CS minor - only EECS class I've taken is 183). As cheesy as it sounds, BSI admitted you cause they think you have what it takes to work hard and create a good name for yourself, and in turn the program. You can do this!. . Career advice-wise, I would say the following for IA and then both pathways (I officially am an IA student and although I did take a lot of UX classes and could probably give UX centric advice, I'll hold off on that for now). . . - if you want to do consulting (which I would strongly recommend people who are interesting in consulting think over why), avoid the consulting recruiting that is done through BSI like the fucking plague (well, COVID-19 for our generation). This is because most companies outside of a few pre-silo BSI students for their ""tech consulting/implementation"" arms INSTEAD of their management consulting/strategy consulting arms. This doesn't sound like a big deal but is huge long term, but it is a massive one. All the good job prospects, growth, and exit opportunities (job wise and for grad school) 90% come to those who are in management/strategy work. Tech consulting *sounds* sexy (read: these companies do a damn impressive job at marketing their work like crazy and making it sound super revolutionary and technically amazing, but it's just smoke and mirrors/bullshit) but its really not and honestly has very limited job growth/skill development - most tech consultants find themselves quickly wanting to fast track into doing actual tech later (usually software engineering or product management, just focus on doing CS to begin with if you want to do this) or switching to their firm's/another firm's management/strategy consulting divisions (which is incredibly hard/nearly impossible if your background is tech consulting, for reasons I can get into later). Source: I recruited consulting and landed a few offers in management and strategy.. . - if you want to do anything tech that isn't data analyst/business analyst stuff, strongly consider a CS minor. BSI's IA pathway is really lacking (for various reasons, another convo entirely) and a CS minor will give you some much needed structure in your technical chops to better enable you to land a technical role that isn't just basic data/business analyst work. . . - Check out a few of the UX classes and take some (personal recs: SI 339, SI 422). The UX work at SI is 100000% their crown jewel (p sure at the masters level UMSI is still considered the best UX school in the country) and some of those skills are fantastic to have for IA people, and just to learn in general. . . Ok, now for both pathways: . . - DO STUFF OUTSIDE CLASS. But it's more than that, invest in meaningful things outside of class. Don't just do clubs or shit for the sake of ""resume building"". Find stuff you're interested in and things you can talk about at networking events/interviews that speak to your interests and well capabilities and pursue those. It can be anything from side projects (PM me if you want to do this and I can help you figure out stuff if you're at a loss of where to start) to professional orgs (BSI actually has a few good ones, and there are some real gems across campus) to professional societies (i.e. the ""tech frat"" (as dumb as that sounds) - great for meeting like minded people and people who can keep you motivated and help you push yourself to the next level of whatever you want to accomplish). Key thing is to pick carefully - quality over quantity and JUST DO IT. Your personal and professional growth will thank you in spades for this down the line. . . - DONT fall into the habit of coasting. It's pretty well known amongst BSI students (and I think this is also a reason why so many undergrads want to do the BSI) that classes on average are not that difficult and fairly easy to do well in/get a high GPA. Do NOT use this as an excuse (consciously or not) to start coasting and not continuing to put in hard work outside of classes to build yourself. You 100000% get out of this program (and your college education in general) what you put into it. Earlier comments I made (linked at start) dig into this a bit more.. . - If you're considering doing software engineering (SWE) via the BSI I would strongly caution against that for a lot of reasons (can get into this later, spark notes version is its just a massive uphill battle and doing cs would be much better for this). u/SuhDudeGoBlue wrote a fantastic comment (here: https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/fz4m2x/should_i_change_majors_from_cs_if_i_feel_stressed/fn59da8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on this yesterday that I think anyone considering SWE via BSI should read and take to heart. I know this sounds super hypocritical of me to say of all people, but I say it for good reason. My situation and background wasn't normal at all and I very admittedly got very lucky. . . Only other thing I'll say for now as to do with your mention of the economy declining and the recession we're likely going to have soon. I don't wan't to be a fear monger and don't want to be that guy, but at the same time I do want to be honest and critical about the future for your sake and professional career. Things will likely be tough recruiting wise for the Class of 2021 and probably the Class of 2022. Keep this in mind and consider what roles will suffer from it and what won't as much. BSI-wise, I would hazard a guess that traditional UX roles will be harder to recruit for and land as they don't usually do well in recessions (and there's just less UX roles to begin with usually compared to say software engineers), and that for IA traditional roles (I.e. business analyst/data analyst/tech consultant) will still be there, but also much harder to recruit for and fewer opportunities overall. . . I hope this helps. LMK if you (or anyone else reading this) has any questions/followups and I'll do my best to answer them.. .

The great thing about PitE is that its super interdisciplinary, meaning you can go the social science/humanities route if you want, or the science route, which is what I'm doing! I would say the major is generally split 50/50 between students who pursue social science vs sciencey science. . . I would say that your major doesn't really matter, if you want to do research on sustainability and air pollution, that'll depend on your classes and extracurriculars, and PitE is great because you can take a bunch of classes from different departments and still count them for the major. . . The main difference between PitE and the Earth dept. is that Pite is obviously very interdisciplinary in the classes it offers, whereas Earth is very straightforward and is much more niche. Another big difference is that Earth requires prereqs like Calc, physics, and chem, whereas PitE doesn't. I know a lot of people who double major in both departments by focusing in social science and policy through pite, and doing the more heavier science coursework through Earth, but you can also take any earth class as a pite major (so long as you've fulfilled the prereqs), so double majoring may or may not be beneficial depending on your personal situation. I didn't have time to do all the Earth pre-reqs so I decided to be a PitE B.S with a minor in geology through the earth department. Also, you can apply to SEAS with any undergrad major, it doesn't matter. . . There's a ton of great research happening in both departments! In Pite you'll find more research being done on sustainability and policy (and will likely find a professor doing air pollution research), whereas with the earth department its a lot of geology, chemistry, paleontology, etc research. On the PitE and Earth websites you can find a list of faculty to email if you're interested in their research, and lots of SEAS professors also accept undergrads in their labs so you can email any of them as well.

I would really appreciate hearing about anybody's transfer experience between these schools, or any advice in general. . . I applied to transfer to U of M because I'm worried that I won't have as good of a shot at grad schools (I'm hoping to get an MPA or an MPP) and my future career if I stay at MSU. The problem is, I really like MSU: I'm doing pretty well (3.633 GPA after first semester, with JMC's weed-out courses), I've made so many great friends, I love my professors, and my major is exactly what I want to do (comparative cultures and politics). I would retain more credits (I have 57 as of my second second semester) if I stayed at MSU as well. . . At U of M, I'm not quite sure what major I would do- it doesn't seem like it would be quite as perfect of a fit as my major at MSU. I would, however, be much closer to my parents because they live in a town just outside of Ann Arbor, and it would be great to worry less about them. I'm unsure if this is a pro or a con, but none of my credits so far would affect my GPA at U of M. I would have a chance to get a higher GPA than I have now, which I hope to do regardless, but there also would be more pressure on my last three years. . . I'm so scared that I'll transfer to U of M and regret it because I won't fit in as well or find as many friends, or that the culture will be more competitive. I'm also terrified that I'll regret staying at MSU, and that I won't be as motivated to achieve more, or that I'll miss opportunities that could help my career, or I won't get into a good grad school.

The benefits of signing a lease at this time are almost non-existent, and most landlords aren't even treating this scenario any different than normal. There is a very likely (not saying more than 50%, but given that the usual chance of an event like this is effectively 0, I'm trying to say that it's a real chance) chance that some or all classes will not be held in person come fall. It's essentially certain that there will still be some restrictions in place come Fall, how much is really what we're not sure about. . . Currently, Ann Arbor is in the middle of a strong hiring slowdown with many residents out of a job and falling behind on rent. As a prospective leaser, you have all the power here, despite what some landlords may be saying. Given that, even during normal times, plenty of people are moving in and out of the city at any time, you won't not be able to find housing if you wait a month or two. In addition, you're also much more likely to get a good deal out of someone trying to get out of their lease if they decide they no longer would like to stay in Ann Arbor for the year. . . If I was looking for a place, middle of June would be where I would start to look. By then, we should have a decent idea of what classes are looking like for the upcoming semester, while still having plenty of time to find a spot.

I was also lucky to have joined a few great clubs freshman yr (esp my consulting club) and made friends with upperclassmen in a major i was interested in (declared end of freshman year) which had the added benefit of them being able to guide and mentor me a bit with course selection, which profs were best, etc. I also found engineering advising was really good at helping, so I'm sure there are similar resources for LSA.. .

But, please consider that him alone taking a pay cut is not going to solve this issue. . . In yesterday's thread about this there was a discussion about staff not getting any form of merit or cost of living raise. I did some math using the [2019 salary spreadsheet](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/errwpc/public/3/3/1/3314612.html). . . There are around 13,400 employees making $50,000 or less per year. If each of those employees were to get a cost of living raise of 1.5%, it would cost just over $7,500,000. If you include those making $60,000 or less it would cost just under $13 million.. . Edit: I also think with the pay cut stuff it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If they had left it out of that email he'd be pilloried for not doing so and when he announced that he had, we'd be in the same situation. Whether or not it yields anything, my hope is that it encourages other high salaried faculty and staff to consider a small pay cut.
