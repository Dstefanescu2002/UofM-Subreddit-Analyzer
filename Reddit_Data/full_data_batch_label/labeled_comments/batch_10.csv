However, a tactic is only useful within the context of a plan - and the protests we're seeing have no such plan. They're merely random rage which isn't going to accomplish anything.. . Indeed, the manner of these protests is almost perfectly calibrated to ensure inaction.. . The key to successful political change is to co-opt the opposition.. . Consider the Civil Rights movement of the 60s. When they marched, they wore their Sunday best - despite the fact that there was a strong likelihood those clothes would be ruined by water/dogs/beatings. The reason they did this is because they had an actual plan. They were looking to create a certain set of optics. They wanted non-black people to not think about Civil Rights as a 'black' issue but a 'people' issue. They wanted others to think ""what if that were me"" - something that wouldn't have occurred if they dressed in a 'stereotypically black' fashion.. . Think about Rosa Parks. It makes a nice story, doesn't it? Decent, upstanding citizen just wants to take a bus ride home in peace.. . But that's not the reality. The reality is that Rosa Parks was *chosen* because she could be portrayed as a decent, upstanding citizen. She was sent out and had to actually work hard to find a bus driver who would make her sit in the back of the bus. The entire story you've learned was nothing more than a bit of theatre that was highly unrepresentative of black people's experiences with the bus at the time.. . *But it worked*. The Civil Rights leadership planned and executed that bit of theatre so they could convince people of the injustice of the rules.. . Or consider the Gay Rights movement. There are a lot of people even today who believe that HIV/AIDS in the U.S. is a problem for people other than male homosexuals, despite the fact that most transmission involves gay men either directly or at once remove. Why? Because the Gay Rights movement spent a lot of effort trying to convince people that HIV/AIDS wasn't just a 'gay disease'.. . Likewise, think about the core issues of the Gay Rights movement once it really started moving forward: marriage and the military. Now, if you surveyed gay people at the time about their main concerns, neither of these issues would appear in the top 5. They were, from the standpoint of most gay people, faintly ridiculous - relatively few gay men wanted to join the military *or* get married.. . But those issues were carefully chosen to appeal to non-gay people. They were chosen specifically because they create ""we're just like you"" narrative. They were chosen to make the issues of gay men the issues of heterosexuals.. . Contrast that with Black Lives Matter. It's hard to imagine a worse way to approach this issue. By calling it ""Black Lives Matter"", you automatically exclude the majority of the nation. You make the claim that your issue is your issue alone and they shouldn't care about it. Indeed, it's not uncommon to see black folks at protests telling white people ""it's nice that you're here, but you need to shut up and listen"" - which is just a roundabout way of saying ""don't care about our issue or make any efforts on our behalf"".. . The result is that you get a few 'allies' who come out because it makes them feel better about themselves or believe it makes them look good to others - but who put zero effort into actual change once it stops being fun. The majority simply ignores you because it's not about *them*.. . Consider for a moment that the majority of the nation has a negative opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement. Think about just how badly you need to mismanage your political movement that the underlying premise - that it's a tragedy when people are killed by the police - gets a *negative* response.. . So enjoy your 'revolt'. Just be aware that you aren't participating in useful political reform. You're just making it harder for people who are interested in useful political reform to accomplish it.",-5.0,error,0.0

You can register at your dorm address/off-campus housing address OR your permanent address. The right of college students to do this has been affirmed by the Supreme Court.. . If you are from out of state, you need to register using a paper form found [here](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/MIVoterRegistration_97046_7.pdf). Fill in your campus address and social security number, leave driver's license blank. There is no need to fill out mailing address. Check over it to make sure you got everything (check boxes at the top, sign and put today's date at the bottom). . If you are from Michigan and have a valid Michigan driver's license or state ID, you can [register online](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/). You can register at either your school address or your permanent, however, it will update your driver's license/ID to be the same address you registered to vote at if different from the address on your license.. . You can also register to vote on the same day as the election. We do not recommend doing this. Register early, it is much easier. To register same day (or within 15 days before the election) means you need to go to the clerk's office on Huron with the previously linked voter form and proof of residence which can be your Wolverine Access account or a piece of mail with your name and Ann Arbor address on it. Again, we do not recommend doing this.. . If you want to vote absentee and are registered in Michigan, (which I recommend personally because lines to vote for campus precincts can be very long and slow, and general election ballots are very long) you need to fill out [this form](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/AVApp_535884_7.pdf) after you are registered and mail it in to the clerk of the city/town in which you are registered. You do not need a reason to vote absentee in Michigan, so you can basically treat this like early voting.. . If you are registered on campus but have moved to a different address, you need to update your registration to reflect a current residence, even if it's in the same general area. . . To vote in person, you need a photo ID, which can be your MCard. The ""Voter ID"" card they send you in the mail only tells you which precinct you vote in which can be helpful because many voting locations on campus have more than one precinct and it sucks to wait in the wrong line, but you need photo ID. We recommend MCard because it's valid but it doesn't have an address on it. If you use an out of state driver's license or license with an out of date address, the poll-workers might question your ability to vote in the location you are at. Using your MCard eliminates that possibility and is an acceptable form of ID. . . Hopefully that covers all the bases for people and feel free to PM me if you have questions!

t1_ftbbnno,2020-06-07 23:05:41,t3_gyfoyf,t3_gyfoyf,"On my previous comments on previous posts, I voiced my concerns regarding the qualification of the people running the account. I genuinely think they have the best intentions when they made the account and as Reddit user u/sarindipityy pointed out in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/gw91he/umich_account_trending_on_twitter_for_posting/fstukkl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) the account was indeed started by members of the Black community following their frustrations in the system where survivors were afraid to come out and identify their assaulter due their position in the community. I fully understand it is extremely hard come out and name your assaulter, especially if the assaulter has connections with the university (professor, student-athlete, etc...) and the university may be inclined to keep the story under tight wraps until a hearing is concluded; however, no matter how fucked up the system can be at times, it does not give an unqualified person to ""expose"" sexual assaulters in a public setting (with their photos). The main issue I have with the account is my suspicion about the qualifications of the people running the account and how some malicious people can utilize the platform for nefarious purposes. First of all we have no idea who is running the account and what makes them qualified to do so. People investigating sexual assault (police and/or university committees) are trained in the subject matter and in most cases can distinguish fact from fiction when it comes to allegations. The people running the account on the other hand are probably university students who already have their hands full with classes and/or work, they have neither the time nor the resources to go through each allegation and verify if they are true beyond reasonable doubt. They probably don't have access to the most basic tool of them all, criminal records of the people involved. There are thousands of students in U of M and I doubt if someone sent an allegation where they used a real U of M students name with someone else's photo the account would be able to verify if the student was a real student at all, I certainly couldn't that in a reasonable time-frame by simply looking up a name in M-Community and scouring the internet for social media accounts. This brings me up to my second issue, which is people with malicious intentions using the account for their personal vendettas. A lot of people point out that false accusations, when it comes to sexual assault, is pretty low as one Reddit user, u/chopp-chopp pointed out [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21164210/?otool=umichlib) in a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/gwp36j/twitter_accounts_exposing_sexual_assault_seem/fswdh14/?context=3) (although the false accusation estimate the study finds is 2-8%) . The issue a lot of people point out is that most of the figures are from instances where the survivors reported their assaulter through official channels and therefore any instance of false report would fall under perjury and hence would have resulted in likely prison time for the accuser. Anonymous reporting that the account tries to achieve will remove this aspect and makes it more likely to have ""false positives"" when it comes to accusations and it is likely that we'll see the numbers increase as the account makes more and more posts. A false allegation can destroy a students reputation and in some cases cost them their jobs, scholarship, and even their visa. When such cases occur in real life and the accused person is acquitted, they can demand compensation due to lost income and social damages but with such an account the most that happens is the post is removed (like to one about Karon Higdon) and the account does not even issue an apology. I understand survivors might feel reluctant to go on record, especially when their is a power discrepancy between them and their assaulter but anonymous reporting makes unsubstantiated accusations more likely and can reduce the legitimacy of sexual assault claims in the future. Like in statistics, we can sometimes have ""biased"" estimators that regularly underestimate the true quantity, but they are consistent with their estimations rather than correct every once in a while and severely wrong in most others. The current system is like that, it is not perfect and has its flaws but it is the best thing we have right now, and is certainly better than handing the reins to some 20-year-old college students who have no accountability. I genuinely think the account has good intentions but right now, the system they intend to build can easily be manipulated with malicious intent and the reputation of the account can be used as a tool in some peoples personal vendettas. Now if I can make some suggestions, it would be to change the account into a platform where the survivors can make their voice heard and share their stories, not accuse people. A platform where survivors can share their stories can empower others and help them come forward to proper law enforcement agencies; on the other hand, the current platform, one where people can anonymously pursue personal vendettas without fear of legal repercussions can end up hurting the legitimacy of survivor testimonies. I think the best the account can do for now is to name the organization but not the person in the stories (Such as someone in the XYZ frat/ YZX team/ ZYX club... assaulted someone...), and certainly stop using peoples photos, which would achieve the twin goals keeping the false accusations to a minimum while naming out institutions with a culture of sexual assault (which the ""Alphas"" frequently named in the account certainly seem to have)so others can avoid them or be more careful in the future. . . . . EDIT: TLDR: A college student is not qualified to run such an account which can result in false accusations that can destroy someones life even if official channels are inadequate. This sort of thing should be done by professionals with means and even than posting someones name and photo without proving them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt is quite dangerous given the severity of accusations.. . . . EDIT2: A lot of people are noting that the account is simply removing false accusations without any apologies, I think they should at least acknowledge their mistakes and issue apologies to those hurt instead of simply removing the posts. No one is perfect and people bound to make mistakes but given the stakes apologies are in order",19.0,error,0.0

What typically happens is positions are first filled with SI PhD students, and the remaining spots are then open for UMSI students to apply for. Your best bet is to take classes your first two semesters, do really well in them, get to know the professor through office hours, and then apply to be a TA or GSI for that class. Preference is almost always given to students to have taken the class before, done well, and understand how it works. You can always apply to classes outside of SI, though these departments will typically take their own students first. Leverage your undergrad degree/work experience and apply to that department if you can.. . Teaching assistant/instructional assistant or grader positions are also available, though these are just hourly rate jobs without the benefits (or responsibilities) of a GSI. You would typically work ~10 hours a week and get paid $15-20/hr, mostly creating assignments, grading, helping a GSI, but not directly teaching a class.

In general, try to acquire any teaching experience you can - whether that's tutoring, volunteering, being an IA - and that will help your application. . . There's a lot of SI students both undergrad and grad, which creates a high need for instructors. But there's also so many grad students (I believe my class was ~200) so there is quite a bit of competition. Also being a GSI one semester does not guranree you'll continue (professors change, some classes are only offered in the fall, the number of GSIs hired is dependent on enrollment, etc.) I would say there's maybe 25ish GSI positions per semester between undergrad and graduate classes that end up being open for UMSI students, but again very dependent on enrollment.

That aside, the key issues is any damages or libel suits that are filed (to my understanding, again I am not a lawyer) is that aside from taking a long time (our legal process is inherently designed to be slow to optimize the fairness and just decision making + outcomes that are fair (obviously not a perfect system)), it is hard to sometimes quantify or express the level of damages caused in these events. . . Let's use an example. Say Bill gets accused, and he's just a regular student at the University with an internship lined up. Bill's internship employer finds out about this and cans Bill immediately. But Bill didn't actually do anything and this claim is baseless/false. In this case, if Bill's lawyers can prove he lost out on the income he would have earned from his internship (which is fairly easy to do), then he has a case. Basically from my understanding, if you can prove concrete and immediate damages then you have a strong case but again I'm not a lawyer.. .

And that's a problem that needs to stop. In addition. Too many cases are dismissed as ""this is just regret"" or ""there isn't enough evidence so we just won't investigate"" those are the problems that need to change.. .

The idea that you have to be a designated saint with thousands of hours of volunteering, research, and extra-curricular activities practically requires pre-meds to start taking those things seriously early on. Sure, you can do it later, but if you haven't taken the pre-reqs and don't have a medical school sanctioned activity, off to grad school you go. The application process doesn't account for a kid fresh out of high school taking time to find out what it is they really want to do (at least not if you want to be competitive).

Sure, you have good days where you feel good about a difference you made in someone's life, but those days stand out because they are rare. Physicians are not excluded from this.

The elements of libel/defamation are a 1) false statement of fact, 2) made with ""actual malice,"" that 3) causes someone injury. The ""actual malice"" element shouldn't be read literally--it's language from the seminal Supreme Court case on this issue called New York Times v. Sullivan. It means the person making the statement--the declarant--knew the statement was false or recklessly disregarded its veracity. ""Recklessly disregarded"" is more legal jargon, but it means that the declarant should have known their statement was false.. . Now, onto this account. Whether the accusations are defamation/libel will depend on the contents of the statements and how factual they are. Notice the first element doesn't just say, ""false statement""; it says, ""false statement of fact."" So, an accusation that merely said, ""X made me feel uncomfortable,"" or ""Y was being creepy,"" or something along those lines, would not be defamation or libel because each would be a statement of opinion, not fact. Now, if the statement said, ""X raped me,"" that is different, because that is a statement of fact. The question then would be whether the statement was true. That issue would have to be resolved accusation by accusation, but one could imagine false accusers retracting their accusations after the people they accused took legal action. Otherwise, there will have to be a lot of money spent on trying to find out what actually happened, which might not be worth it for a lot of people. So, you're ultimately right--the plaintiff would have to effectively disprove the accusation in that situation, which is tough to do.

BBUM, which was started by the U-M Black Student Union, has its roots in the Black Action Movement (BAM) protests of the 1970s and 1980s.. . BAM was a series of protests, strikes, and other events led by students that sought to address a range of racial issues on campus including the perpetually low enrollment of black students and frequent lack of support for those that were enrolled. . . In 1970 BAM I led to an almost three weeks long strike of campus that gained a great deal of support from the wider student and faculty body. I am condensing a lot here (below are resources if you'd like to read more detailed accounts), but as a result the university committed to the goal of increasing black student enrollment to 10% within three years (it was around 3% at the time). . . The university did not meet that goal and has long struggled to increase enrollment of black and other underrepresented minority students. Among other things this is demonstrated by the fact that both BAM II and BAM III led to similar policies being enacted in an effort to increase enrollment, but the results did not follow or were not sustained. Michigan laws and Supreme Court decisions have also complicated the ways in which U-M can work to increase representation of minority students on campus. . .

Historically, as state funding has gone down, tuition has gone up; consider that if UMich becomes private tuition will become even more prohibitive than it is now. Also, consider that the money UMich receives in its endowment must be spent as specified by the donor, as opposed to General Fund money which is more flexible.. . I'm not really sure I follow the reasoning behind point 3 regarding overflowing majors. First of all, I view the problem behind the uneven student-faculty ratio in CS not as an over-registration problem, but as an understaffing problem. If students are expressing higher demand for CS degrees, the University's best move is to meet said demand via expanding supply. Since CS is offered through multiple schools including LSA, UofM's largest school, there is no real way to mitigate the number of students pursuing CS majors. As of right now, applicants are not required to commit to a major before entering the school, so any admittants to LSA have the option of joining the CS program at any time. In any case, I don't think there exists any compelling reason to limit the opportunities of UMich students by cutting off their ability to pursue a certain major.. . Regarding point 4, college rankings are a) artifical, b) sort of arbitrary, and c) mostly pointless. I sincerely hope that prospective students are prescient enough not to seriously consider them a factor as they decide which university to commit themselves to; these rankings mostly only exist so parents and grandparents can be passive-aggressive during large family gatherings.. .

A university with 4,000 students will ""spend"" $1000 per student. A place like UM with 40,000 students will ""spend"" $100 per student. Are the students at the smaller school getting $900 more spent on them per year? No, it's being spent on cicadas.. . I'd say the same thing about ""investment returns"" -- assuming that means proceeds on the endowment. If I endow a fund to study pediatric brain cancer, that's where the proceeds are going. They're not going to students. Some proceeds will--we have great donors who give money to fund things that directly benefit students.

They have a contract with a towing company that WILL end up costing you/your family/your friend who didn't know better $300.

There is a hilariously accurate google review about her, saying something along the lines of ""anytime you try to have a logical argument with her she just speaks even louder at you"". Maintenance is terrible compared to every other place that I've lived. They take days on end to even respond to your request (even if it is something pressing).

After taking 304, I think there's actually a pretty wide range of skill level you can be at while still being at ""passed 204"" level, based on the different levels of people who were in my class. Before the placement exam, I was able to speak Chinese fluently at a conversational level. I'm not sure about reading/writing but I knew 95% of the words in the first couple of 304 lessons before any studying and I was still only able to read maybe 60-70% of the placement test lmao. To be honesty, if you already feel/know your Chinese is better than a lot of your peers, you'll probably do well especially if you study a little more.. . I suggest you focus on studying reading (mainly bc writing isn't tested as much) and do passive speaking practice by talking to your family in Chinese as much as possible. If there's anything you don't know how to say, ask them how to say it and then repeat the sentence using the new vocab so you can practice with it a bit. For reading, I also recommend the app DuChinese (they have free readings every few days at a number of different levels--you should probably be able to read intermediate/intermediate-high with only a few characters you don't know). If you're feeling adventurous, trying reading materials targeted for native speakers (newspapers, online articles, so on) with a dictionary. I highly recommend the dictionary app Pleco if you're interested in trying that. . . There are a few sample questions for the placement test on their website (I'm not sure where it is but I remember seeing them before). Most of the test is on the computer. Off the top of my head, I know there's a section where you fill in the sentence with the correct word/phrase and I believe there's a section where you need to select what was wrong in the sentence. There's also a paper section where you're given sentences in English and you need to translate it to Chinese. For the last section, you'll talk with one of the professors. Everyone I've talked to has said it was a conversation, but I actually had more of a question-and-answer section where the professor asked my questions from a paper and I was to answer them the best I could.. .

That's just the nature of need-based financial aid, as defined by the federal government and the FAFSA, under the country's current model of paying for college. . . > In a similar vein, there are plenty of students whose parents do make substantial income, but refuse to contribute to their educational costs in anyway. I don't understand why a student in that situation wouldn't qualify for financial aid. I'm thankful that my parents do try to help me, but that's definitely not everyone's situation and I feel like financial aid programs should address this.. . Again, a person in that scenario does not have financial need as defined by the federal government. Under the current system, that makes sense. If any family could just say ""yeah, we have money, but we would rather not use it to pay for our kids' college"" and the kids would get need-based aid, no upper middle class to wealthy people would choose to use their own money instead of receiving free money. . . Under a different system, where college is free (or closer to free) for everyone, the children of parents like these would be better accommodated. And the parents would pay their fair share, since it would be funded via taxes which vary based on family income. (And the taxes are aimed at the ultra rich and at very large inheritances, from the plans I've read.). . In the meantime, students in that situation should seek out schools with generous merit-based aid. They exist. This is really the only beef of yours that I see that is specific to UM - the fact that the university doesn't give much merit-based aid. If they did, it would make it easier for people without financial need as defined by the federal government. . . > I just found the upper bracket the Go Blue Guarantee specifies to feel almost like false advertising because of that. ... In particular, I just don't find the advertising of the Go Blue Guarantee to be an accurate picture of how Umich ""helps"" their middle class students. Perhaps it is helpful for some in that income bracket, but I think you can be easily mislead into thinking it helps the middle class more often than it doesn't.. . The statistics on the website are not lies. So while it doesn't help you or the people you've talked to anecdotally (related: many students don't understand their families financial situations in great depth, so don't believe 100% of everything you hear), it does show that 98% of in-state financial aid applicants whose families make $65K - $95K get scholarships and grants for an average of $16K per year, 90% of in-state financial aid applicants whose families make $95K - $125K qualify with an average of $10K in annual scholarships and grants, etc. The financial aid calculator that the university supplies is also pretty accurate, assuming students and their families put in the right information. Resident families aren't being asked to pay more than their EFCs as defined by the federal government. (But feel free to take issue with how EFCs are defined.) . . > Sorry if I came of as aggressive in my comments.

This is not to be callous or anything; I hate that our society is the way it is and I would much rather have classes online in the fall and have tuition cut and still have the workers paid, but I don't think that's possible. . . The university is ultimately a business. It can't get money from nowhere, it can't pay its workers with nothing; it should be able to guarantee pay for workers AND implement tuition cuts and online schooling, but unfortunately, the world isn't a socialist utopia (yet). Until the day comes when we can implement better policies and have a strong enough societal support system, we have to balance the practical with what is right, because the capitalist economy favors money more than people's lives and well-being.. . While the administrative pay cuts may seem small, they are puny compared to even the money lost on housing just this year. If the school did what is right and didn't open student housing (because dorms are the most disgusting places on Earth) the money lost would far overshadow any pay cut any of the top administrators could take. They could all be fired, and it would barely help. However financially sound the school may seem, in the past few months we've had huge businesses tank in a matter of weeks. The school HAS to favor money over student well being, at least to a certain extent; the capitalist world is a cruel one. . . I'm sure the school is weighing the risks and benefits of reopening. To be honest, I'm worried about the workers who are often not included in this conversation because I'm sure some of them would rather work and bear a certain amount of risk than go homeless or lose food security and health insurance. Unemployment benefits can only go so far. Much like you, I'm frustrated that the world is the way that it is, but I don't think this is a one-sided issue.

Most of the class's lectures were disconnected topics only related by the final project. You learn a lot of very interesting things but only at a basic level and don't get to apply them. The lab I found to be very enjoyable. For the first half of the semester we mostly played around with the drone getting it to move and be steady eventually getting it to position itself next to a wall. The final challenge is getting the drone to fly through a maze autonomously. The way we do that is program a single C++ function that checks the distances read by the lidar on top of the drone then sets a desired yaw pitch and roll to get through the maze. The other main topic was tuning a PID controller. The problem with the class is that the most efficient way to do the project is to try as many different solutions as possible and hope one works, which isn't engineering, it's hacking. I would say in the last couple of weeks my team spent ~10 hours at the maze trying to get our drone through it. . . Also the final and midterm had questions about what we learned in lecture but since there wasn't any assignments to apply what we learned in lecture, it ended up being difficult for students to do well on that section of the tests. . . Overall it was a fun and interesting class but it's content wasn't very applicable to the rest of the CS program.

Pretty much all of the upperclassmen and most sophomores live in apartments and houses that they have already signed the lease for, and most of them are probably going to live in the house that they have paid for whether the school is online or not. Given this behavior, does it make sense for the University to shut down completely? Furthermore, by September most students will have been at home for roughly 6 months, and I can't imagine that the average student will be willing to continue in the same way for another 8 months-1 year. If students are bound to become fed up and act irresponsibly, does it make sense for the University to remain shut down? Finally, you mention the fact that COVID-19 is a risk to college students as well, but how big is that risk? Freak accidents occur and some may die, but how much more tragic would it be if all of the first-gen, low income students educations got seriously derailed, locking them and their future generations in their lower income status.(Let's not kid ourselves, online education was an absolute joke this semester, I can't imagine what another year of such teaching would mean for people's education). I think the only legitimate concern is what will to the local Ann Arbor community, but they need the school to open as well due to economic reasons.

However, we are at war right now and we all need to play our part -- the thing about wars is that everyone needs to make sacrifices and our sacrifice is going to be our comfort and the quality of our education and while it sucks I think it's something we have to do for the greater good.. . Not everyone is going to agree with you on this. Hell, I don't agree with you on this. . . >> Not to mention, part of Schlissel's assumptions for the ""public health informed semester"" is that people will follow a ""social compact"". In my opinion, that assumption is too optimistic and to some extent it is naive unless he has some way of enforcing it -- which even then that's a stretch because how exactly will UofM follow around 46,000 students to make sure nobody breaks the compact.. . No shit 46,000 students won't follow the compact, but these people are partying at home or living in their houses in Ann Arbor and partying anyway. College kids are gonna be college kids. . . >> Some might say, ""well if the NCAA reopens, we have to participate"" and I just don't feel like that's true. Yes, it would create issues, but if UofM cares as much as they claim about their students and by extension the student athletes then they would temporarily withdraw from the NCAA or at the very least not participate in some of the major sports like football even if they'd lose money - because that's what putting students first looks like.. . Temporarily withdraw from the NCAA . I guarantee you do not understand the inner workings of the collegiate athletic system in this country by assuming we can just withdraw from the NCAA. If the University of Michigan went rogue on the rest of the Big Ten and decided not to play football this year, we would put a $750 million annual television contract in jeopardy and risk our spot as a member of the conference. Seriously. And this stretches beyond sports, too. The reason we collaborate in research with schools like Illinois, Wisconsin, Purdue, Iowa, etc. is because we are a part of the Big Ten Academic Alliance, which is the world's most powerful research consortium. . . >> We cannot allow the University to put our lives second in the name of saving money first. Some might bring up that UofM needs the money otherwise it could damage our education in the future if not put UofM in financial peril. While I am aware currently colleges are fighting for their very existence because of the financial pains brought on by COVID-19, I believe UofM will be fine whether or not we come back. The endowment fund for UofM is 12 billion dollars and 22% of that is just return on investments made. Our endowment fund ranks in the top ten out of all colleges across the United States. I am aware the endowment fund is not a bank account and you can't just take money out of it on a whim, but this is still is evidence of the financial solvency of UofM.. . Saving money??? The damn institution is going to go broke if we don't have students back. If students go part-time or take gap years in large numbers, the university is set up for a massive logistical nightmare. . . >> I personally have considered starting a petition, writing letters, etc. to the school to tell them to stay shut down and to focus their resources on creating a better online experience since the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be completed by sometime next year. If not that extreme, at least a petition or letters or something telling the school to cancel big fall sports like football. However, I have held off on that because it seems as though public support seems to be for reopening and it feels pointless to even try. I guess this is both a rant and perhaps an exercise to see if there were others who felt the same as I do.. . I'm glad you're voicing your opinion on something you feel passionate about, but the financial consequences of an online semester make that possibility unrealistic, at best. . . We've all been sold down the river on a college experience that we won't get to have for a year and a half of our four years. And it sucks. . . But no matter what the school does, everyone who is not a freshman will be returning in the end of August. People are dying to see friends, to party, and to return to some sort of normalcy. People have leases, and they are not going to let them go to waste. In my case, I moved away from my hometown after I graduated high school and I live in a part of the country that is not well represented at Michigan. Because of this, I have no nearby friends from high school or college. I left Michigan in March, and will be returning in August. That will be essentially five months of EXTREMELY limited contact with friends. . . And as someone who is low risk for serious complications regarding COVID and has no co-morbidities, why should I sacrifice what should be one of the most exciting, interesting, and fun periods of growth in my life for this?. . No matter whether or not classes are online, 20,000 undergrads (myself included) will be returning to Ann Arbor, and there's nothing the school can do to stop it.

I worked hard to get accepted to a graduate program. I decided to accept admission at Michigan because I wanted the resources it offers. I wanted the culture it has. I wanted to work alongside other students who have a vision for innovation in Engineering. I've wanted to go to Michigan since I was in high school. This is finally my chance at it, and I'm pissed that it's on the line to be taken away from me. Online education isn't the same, it's not even close. . . Personally, I've already signed a lease for the upcoming year and I'll be moving to AA even if my classes are mostly online because I simply cannot work effectively at my parents house. I know that there are a lot of worries surrounding coming back to campus, and that I may be acting selfishly, but I do think that if the system is worked out correctly that some classes will be able to return and run safely. I also don't think there is a ""right"" way to do this. Either way, there is going to be a negative impact on the Umich/ AA community. Many stores/restaurants are already permanently closed or on the way there, more will probably follow if there isn't a large student population that keep them afloat. These are small businesses, which means it's families that can't pay bills, that can't afford food, and as someone else has stated poverty is also a major concern that we should all be thinking about.",2.0,positive,0.5885480046272278

You were basically given an electronic version of a ""paper exam"" and had to submit it by a certain deadline, otherwise you lose points for submitting late.. . 3.

Having the boxes separate from the actual exam questions, and having to look between your boxes sheet and your laptop screen was annoying for many people.. .

Lower level math classes, especially the calculus sequence, are usually a mess, but being online has made them pretty irritating. I finished up Math 116 (calc 2) online in winter and was in a spring section for about a week (in case I got NRC in winter. I wanted to have a backup) and the formats were the same. Basically, if they haven't changed format from the beginning of spring and end of winter, you're going to just go to 120 minute long live meetings and then break into groups with people for like 20-30 minutes who usually don't say anything or do anything. Winter wasn't bad at all because I knew a good chunk of people in my class and worked with them in person so the interaction wasn't awkward when we switched to online, but spring was awful because interacting with people and building friendships or even socializing with them is impossible. For a team based class, you get like zero opportunity to socialize and connect with people, and when you do get that time most people just stay silent. It makes it really difficult to work through problems and talk through them with people, or to do team homework and plan out who does what and etc. It's like talking to a brick wall, and when you get put into a BlueJeans breakout room and your GSI hops in and you're the only one talking it just feels weird and awkward. Honestly, the lectures could be asynchronous and recorded and you'd probably have the same outcome if not better. The whole part of splitting into teams and attempting to talk with other people online in a live meeting just does not work and is a waste of time. On top of this, the math department, as many other departments have, may have ramped up exam difficulty to combat cheating, which would be easy for an online math class.

There are a variety of factors that contribute to academic preparedness, and I doubt that age/grade is that strong of a predictor. In fact a quick G Scholar search finds data that implies that students who entered college early (before 16 y.o.) tend to self-select and end up performing better than students of the average age at the same college. Obviously, I don't know anything about OP and they may not fit the exact criteria of the participants, but I do think it is wrong to assume that younger individuals who are looking to take college courses are ""statistically"" less prepared. I feel like that topic is much more nuanced than your simplification implies. The fact remains that there is a subset of the highschool population that has the ability to take difficult college courses, and the viewpoint I provided is perfectly valid for them. I reiterate, there is absolutely no reason to assume that this kid will automatically fail this class. . . Additionally, my personal opinion is that its fine to not do well in a class. I think the autonomy to choose classes that will engage you is much more beneficial than simply maintaining GPA. Purposefully avoiding hard classes related to your interests seems like a mistake to me, no matter if the student is a high schooler or a college student.

Most developed countries are like that. . . > healthcare is fantastic but only if you can afford it . . You don't see the problem there do you? According to this NY Times article dated on 12/04/2013 ([https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/health/think-the-er-was-expensive-look-at-the-ambulance-bill.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/health/think-the-er-was-expensive-look-at-the-ambulance-bill.html)), this patient had her employer pay $1,772.42 for a 9 mile journey. That's incredibly mind blowing as a non-American! I mean, granted where I come from the patient will most likely die in traffic while in the ambulance - at least the patient doesn't have to see numbers like that. According to this WHO healthcare performance report ([https://www.who.int/healthinfo/paper30.pdf](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/paper30.pdf) ), the US ranks below countries like Colombia and Morocco. It still does 'okay' - being ranked 37th out of 191 - but it's crazy how poor it fairs. This other website which apparently took a survey of site visitors ( [https://www.numbeo.com/health-care/rankings\_by\_country.jsp](https://www.numbeo.com/health-care/rankings_by_country.jsp) ) found that the US ranked 30th, below countries like Sri Lanka, Ecuador, and Mexico (although I really don't like the way their ranking system works). . . > the US is a juggernaut for healthcare innovations . . Yes. No doubt. But, for a country that produces some of the greatest healthcare innovations, basic medicines still cost an absurd amount. The goal isn't to just do good research, but to also make medication affordable . According to this paper ( [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/\_\_\_media\_files\_publications\_issue\_brief\_2017\_oct\_sarnak\_paying\_for\_rx\_ib\_v2.pdf](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/___media_files_publications_issue_brief_2017_oct_sarnak_paying_for_rx_ib_v2.pdf) ), among 9 highly developed countries, the US has among the highest price for pharmaceuticals. . . > no safety net is objectively false . . I never said the US doesn't have any safety net. I just said it's rubbish compared to some European countries with similar levels of development.

Yeah, but you completely ignore the difficulties associated with getting a diploma from Umich in the first place. Let's start with high school. If you're from a low income family you're probably taking a part-time job and taking care of siblings (if any). This takes away from time that could be spent on studying or extra curricular activities. According to this report ( [https://hechingerreport.org/another-way-college-applications-are-rigged-against-low-income-students/](https://hechingerreport.org/another-way-college-applications-are-rigged-against-low-income-students/) ), low income students have an exceptionally hard time applying to colleges because they're busy literally trying to stay alive. Then you have the issues related to dumbass standardized examinations ( [https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/07/why-poor-schools-cant-win-at-standardized-testing/374287/](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/07/why-poor-schools-cant-win-at-standardized-testing/374287/) ). Now, assuming that these students can get into Umich and get some sort of financial aid, you have issues with college debt ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student\_debt#United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt#United_States) ), working part time ( [https://1gyhoq479ufd3yna29x7ubjn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Low-Income-Working-Learners-FR.pdf](https://1gyhoq479ufd3yna29x7ubjn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Low-Income-Working-Learners-FR.pdf) ), and fitting in ( [https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/03/privileged-poor-navigating-elite-university-life/585100/](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/03/privileged-poor-navigating-elite-university-life/585100/) ). . . > wealth simply isn't handed out here . .

For a country with a progressive tax system this makes no sense. The rich had a tax rate of 70%+ in the 1950's when the US saw its ""golden period"" and now it's somehow nearing 30%. This is literally the state giving out money in a sense to the rich. Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian, points out this absurdity in his book ""Utopia for Realists.""

It's cheaper to own a car in the UK and Germany! . . > We are not the best in everything but we are a generally a fantastic place to be for a host of reasons. As an example, with success one could buy a few hundred acres of land, build a beautiful home on it, shoot guns until you're tired, and then drive 10 minutes into town to work or grab a bite. There is an entire lifestyle that is simply not accessible to those in Europe and I personally would not trade it for hyped up stories about how terrible US is. If you are successful in the US, you are going to be far better off than almost anywhere in the world. . . Yeah, that's what I was saying.

If one can make an argument that illegal immigrants are a pawn between political contention, then international students are merely a pawn between interest groups--remember two weeks ago Umich went out of its way to [defend Chinese international students](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/06/university-of-michigan-leaders-will-strongly-oppose-restrictions-targeting-chinese-students-faculty.html)?

Orgo lab has just been watching short 10-15 minute lab videos and submitting about 2-3 assignments (pre-lab, post-lab, writing assignment, etc.) each week. The assignments are pretty straight forward but they do take at least a couple hours to do minimum and grading is VERY GSI-dependent. A lot of lab GSIs in the spring term are also really young (like rising juniors) so sometimes they weren't the best at giving guidance. What frustrated me the most about 211 though is that there wasn't any sort of grading scale laid out for us. It was kind of just a ""do your best and we'll evaluate you at the end of the term"" but I as well as a lot of other students felt really stressed not knowing what our grade was throughout the term.. . For Orgo 1, I personally don't mind the online format for lectures and exams. The class is definitely a big time commitment with 2-hour lectures 3 times a week, 2 1-hour discussions every week, then maybe an SLC study group on top of all that, and most importantly watching Nolta's office hours and doing the coursepack problems. For the past 2 months of spring term I've had no life lol and just did all of that and saw pretty good results on the exams. Honestly, I feel like the exams are a crazy time-crunch but they're simpler and more straight forward than the coursepack problems. In the coursepack, I've come across a lot of small, tricky problems that stem from a previous question but with the online format, Nolta can't really do that (especially with the boxes on a pdf format) and instead the questions focus on testing your basic knowledge of the concepts/mechanisms. The first exam was really difficult because I couldn't write on the computer screen but exams 2 and 3 went much better after printing them out so I'd definitely recommend doing that.. . Since it is spring term and class is already pretty fast-paced, the main thing for orgo would just be staying on top of material and practice problems. You'll be chilling thinking you have a week before the exam but in the blink of an eye, you'll have a whole lecture's worth of material dumped on you two days before the exam plus the previous concepts to master.

They also make a good point about illegal immigrants generally being in a more vulnerable position financially. They are likelier to be working service jobs that are disrupted due to the pandemic as opposed to students on an F1 visa, who are usually busy being students.. . Second, I'd like to question your claim that Democrats are ""bringing countless illegals over"". I don't think that's accurate. The Obama administration actually did deport many illegal immigrants. I think a more accurate representation of the Democrats' immigration policy is that they want to make legal immigration easier for everyone.. . Finally, I totally understand your frustration. I grew up with my parents facing those same challenges. The future is constantly uncertain, and that's a stressful experience. The road to gaining residence in this country is long, winding, and difficult. You feel powerless against a bureaucracy backed by a government over which you have no control. I know these things from personal experience.. . But please know that this experience is universal to all immigrants, regardless of the method through which you arrived. That helpless feeling is probably amplified when, at any moment, you are facing threat of deportation. Trying gain permanent residence is that much more difficult when you have no F1-OPT track because you have no documentation at all.. . This isn't a competition between legal and illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants are vulnerable just as many legal international students are for many of the same reasons. Instead of applauding the GOP for being ""fair"" in their exclusionary practices, maybe it would be better to consider how we can change this broken immigration system for ourselves and those who come after us.. .

Being admitted means the school has deemed these students to be worthy of the benefits of this institution. Applicants are not entitled to anything if they're not good enough. The same thing applies to the visas OP is talking about. . 2. I'm not implying that foreign students should be entitled to cheaper than domestic tuition. No idea where you got that from. I'm outright stating that 1/3-1/2 of a million is a lot of money. Such a staggering amount makes it more than clear that international students are treated differently to domestic students. . .

t1_fvvtucb,2020-06-24 19:41:10,t3_hf57pn,t3_hf57pn,"I will try to give some advice for 280! For me, as far as coding goes, I found it helpful to read through the entire spec (at least a skim) before I started coding. That way, I knew what to expect in the project and I could have an overall goal when I was coding (more than ""pass the autograder tests"" lol). If you don't already, write tests as you code. It's a good way to double check that your stuff is working and it can save you a LOT of headaches later (ex: for euchre, I had a function in card.cpp that didn't completely work and it was screwing with results in euchre.cpp, and I spent nearly four hours on that single function trying to work it out). It can also be helpful to write out your plans (pseudocode or just brain vomit is good too) when you're stuck on what's happening. I found this extra helpful for stuff like euchre.cpp in p3 and main.cpp in p5 which we had to do without starter code because I had absolutely no idea where to begin but once I had compiled all my thoughts in notes it was a lot easier than I had thought. It was also really useful when I got stuck on functions that weren't working as expected. I would write out what it needed to do in my own words, then make bullet points for what I wanted it to do, then debug on where my current code was messing up. If it's not working, it can also be better to just scrap it (I usually save it as a snippet in Notepad just in case) and just rewrite the function too, so you can think about it again.. . For the exams, I think the best thing you can do is just use the exams for practice (shocking, I know). To be honest, I actually wish there were more resources we could use as far as practicing multiple choice but they still provide us with a lot of exams. I did a couple under testing environments (without using Google or my notes), and then when I finished I corrected my answers and went back to read notes for the stuff I got wrong. I also wrote down the stuff I got wrong on my cheatsheet for quick reference. I struggle most with multiple choice, so I went back and did the multiple choice of other exams at my own pace. I also reviewed the concepts I was weakest on by doing the coding questions for those sections on the exam. I hadn't used the lecture notes before studying for the exam but I found them really helpful for reviewing concepts.. . As a comment on the lectures, I encourage you to attend (or watch) a lecture with an instructor who uses iclicker/poll/multiple choice questions during class. I find that it helps me stay engaged better and it's also a way that I can check my understanding during class, rather finding out later when I'm studying that I actually didn't fully understand the material. It's also nice because the professor will explain common errors/misunderstandings about incorrect answers so you will get reinforcement of why something is correct! Also, I realized that skipping out on lab sections definitely hurt my understanding of the material, so do your best to attend lab! If you're confused about it while you're in lecture, you should definitely to go lab so you can review and have a chance to ask questions in a smaller class.",1.0,error,0.0

The endowment isn't a rainy-day fund, sitting unused, waiting for a good idea (or fiscal crisis) to come along.. . First of all, the endowment fund itself really can't be touched. It's a savings account (or more accurately, many savings accounts), throwing off interest. The interest is what can be spent.. . Most of the time, however, the donor already had an idea of how it should be spent. And it's being spent that way already. If donors gave money for the hospital (which is a big chunk of the endowment) then the interest on that is used by the hospital. If they gave money for an endowed faculty chair, the University can't just fire the professor and use that money to lower tuition instead. . . It would be great if a donor said ""here's a bunch of money, don't do anything with it, just save it until it's really needed"" because that would be great to have right about now. But donors typically have specific parts of the mission that they want to support, and they want to see their funds being used to make a difference as soon as possible. . . From another perspective, the endowment is already being used to lower tuition.

The content will be suitable for senior undergraduates or graduate students interested in hardware-efficient algorithms and their VLSI implementations.. . . **EECS 498-001: Conversational Artificial Intelligence** (warning: Jason Mars course). . The science and art of creating conversational AI spans multiple areas in computer. science. Learning about and leveraging advances in these areas to create state-of-the. art conversational virtual assistants is the central focus of this course. Throughout the. course, students will learn principles of deep learning applied to natural language. processing, dialogue management, response generation, and other applications.. Students will also build end to end virtual assistants using tools that span both. traditional techniques as well as cutting edge techniques for these AI with the goal of. creating experiences that surpass existing technologies such as Google Assist, Siri, and. Alexa. Students will also be tasked with integrating the AI experiences they create with. a set real APIs of their choosing (e.g., Spotify, Fitbit, Unity, etc.).. . . more info can be found here:. . . https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/special-topics-courses/. . https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/new-courses/",4.0,error,0.0

The increase in administration is part of it, some necessary (ie. increased compliance) and some probably unnecessary. . . .

One dean per school, one provost to rule them all. It was ever thus (okay, yes, UM did add deans when we add schools like Ford or Kines, but they always had directors). . . .

Employers are usually either looking for an engineer or a BBA and having both doesn't really open any more doors. Also, most of my friends who were dual degree have chosen one or the other by now (I'm a junior). Business and engineering are not only two completely different subjects, but also require different types of people/personalities to excel at, in my opinion. Usually you'll realize you fit in to one and not the other pretty soon because Ross and CoE have very different communities.. . I don't want to discourage you from trying it out and I do know people who are successfully in the dual degree. The most successful people I know are people who have a genuine passion for both. For example, my friend made a software startup, which combines both CS and business. You'll also learn so much by being in both Ross and CoE and meet so many people.. . I would say the best advice I can give is to alternate coursework between the two. If possible, try to focus on only business classes one semester and then only engineering classes the next. This prevents you from taking completely different courses at the same time, like MKT and EECS, which will only make a 16+ course load even harder.

t1_fwi0k8n,2020-06-30 18:19:01,t3_hio9hu,t3_hio9hu,"I am a rising senior at UM studying pure math and biochem, but I was math sci before I switched to pure math (I dislike diffeq and it is pretty necessary for the submajor I was doing).. . tl;dr:. . 1. Whichever one best suits your interests -- you don't need to know which one when you come in. 2. Mathematical Sciences is a major -- some of your courses might be like that, some might not be. 3. Yes, the honors track is great. Highly recommend if you are interested in math.. 4. The different math majors are all designed for distinct things and hard to compare. 5. Math majors can do all sorts of things, and a math degree doesn't place strict constraints on your career. Yes, even for pure math majors.. 6. ""difficulty"" can be relative, but it is possible to be a math major and have a social life -- I know math majors who are involved in all sorts of things all across campus. Mathematical Sciences is a great track, and if you are passionate about it, it will be workable.. . . . 1. There are a lot of ways to be a mathematics major at UM. There are 5 distinct majors and a couple have different submajors. You mentioned hoping to emphasize computing skills -- for this, there are several submajors that might work equally well. The math advisors (and I will join the chorus of voices that recommend DeBacker, although I haven't met a bad advisor in the department) are fantastic and the programs are extremely flexible by and large -- I would encourage you to explore courses that you are interested in and let that guide you somewhat. . 2. Michigan Math has a reputation -- to some extent it is deserved, to some extent it is because the philosophy and approach to math is not what people are expecting. They care a lot about you really understanding the material, but a lot of people are expecting math to be similar to HS with an emphasis on how to do things algorithmically, with formulas and rules. This is not necessarily how math works, so a lot of people are caught off guard or don't know how to adjust their approach. Calc I and II are small seminars, capped at 18 to my knowledge, taught by a mix of faculty and GSIs, while Calc III and Calc IV are large lectures (maybe with labs/discussions? idk, I took an honors sequence).. 3. With that said, if you are hoping to be a math major, I would highly recommend doing an honors calc sequence. For mathematical sciences, if you have the AP credit, I recommend taking the 156/285/286(Honors Applied Calculus) sequence or the 175/176/285/286 sequence (Honors Seminar Sequence, has some applications since 175 is cryptography focused), but I've heard good things about the 185/186/285/286 sequence, and the 295/296/395/396 sequence is legendary -- I have been told it is incredibly challenging but incredibly rewarding. I took 156 (Honors Applied Calc II) and it was one of the best decisions I could have made for my freshman self. The honors courses are taught as small seminar courses. The honors courses are rigorous, but as others have mentioned, they do also have pretty favorable curves. They are also taught by faculty. . 4. The math majors (all of the many different types) are largely pretty flexible, especially for the first couple of years. After 217 (often thought of as the ""gateway"" course), most of my upper level courses are still a pretty decent mix between the different majors (although Actuarial and FinMath branch off to specific courses pretty shortly after 217).Most upper level courses that aren't Actuarial or FinMath (and even some of those I'd imagine) are fairly heavily proof-based -- even in applied math you will need to learn how to write an effective proof. Part of this is that developing a good understanding of modern mathematics involves developing an understanding and practical use of logic. Just about all of the math courses at UM are going to be challenging to varying degrees -- I would view this as a good thing, as I know I have developed and grown as a mathematician through the challenges of coursework. It would be difficult to pit majors against each other as being more or less difficult because the majors are pretty flexible and it is possible to make any of the majors particularly difficult because the department is fairly flexible about upper level course substitutions -- it is not uncommon for undergrads to take grad level courses. That being said, the math department does generally want its students to succeed, so the majors are all fairly doable if you are willing to put in the time and effort.. 5. As a pure math major, I can tell you that while graduate studies and a subsequent career in academia are options, they are not your only options. I am planning on pursuing a career more tightly in line with my other major, but the department provides a lot of career resources and there are definitely other careers for ""pure"" mathematicians, though many do involve applications of math. Pure mathematics does not mean you cannot do applied math, after all. Applied math will, however, provide coursework that will explore different areas of math and ways of applying math that might be particularly helpful if you want to do.. 6. UM has many challenging courses, but again, they can be incredibly rewarding. This is incredibly true of the math department. It is absolutely possible to be a math major and have a social life -- I myself am fairly involved on campus and I have friends in the department who are involved in an incredibly broad range of campus orgs. Also, the department has a lot of opportunities to get to know other math majors, and we are largely a pretty community-driven bunch.. .

To rub salt in the wound, it's basically impossible to finish exams in the allotted time frame. Scoring above the curve mattered more than actually mastering the material which is annoying since exam averages hovered around \~65%. It is definitely possible, however, to find GSIs that actually care about teaching. I found them to be way more helpful than professors and are the only reason I did decent in the class.. .

For example, I was able to calc BC to get out of calc 1&2 saving me 8 credits and two semesters worth of delay by starting with calc 3. However, even though I got a 5 on both AP econ exams and received 1 credit each you can't use AP econ credits as prereqs for any upper-level econ classes. So being an econ major I had to take econ 101 & 102 in order to take econ 401&402 to fulfill major requirements. Other AP classes that I took like AP government never counted towards my major and in LSA your distribution or gen-eds have to be taken on campus. So those AP credits boosted my number of credits so I hit the ""120 credits needed to graduate"" earlier but they didn't actually help me be able to graduate early because I still needed to fulfill all of the distribution requirements if that makes sense (I ended up graduating with 160+ credits and paying upper-level tuition for 3 years rather than 2). I would say your best bet is to work on classes that will help you get out of approved pre-reqs like starting at calc 3 (rather than calc 1), starting with orgo (rather than gen chem), and being able to test out of some or all of the language requirement as that basically equals an entire semester's worth or courses. The last thing to look at is how courses are structured in your major. For example, econ majors can be done in 3 years with proper planning but application-based programs (organizational studies, public health, SI, ford, PPE etc.) are 2-year programs meaning you will either need 4 years to complete your degree or be ready to apply in January of your freshman year.",1.0,neutral,0.8095977306365967

Your field of study will also impact how flexible things can be. From your post I assume you're in some kind of STEM field. . . The finance staff I work with are doing a lot now to figure out what rules there are regarding each source of student funding and options for remote work. My hope is that in the next two months some things could still be worked out if the current answer is that students have to be in person. Some government and industry grants might not normally allow for remote work. . . Then, if say you are from Iran, you are barred by the US government from working remotely there and receiving funding. . . I think the big question I still don't know as much about is options for GSIs (as an incoming student this likely doesn't impact you). I get the impression that is being worked out this month as faculty finalize plans for how the various in person/hybrid/fully remote options will work. . . The rules are also not the same for incoming vs. returning students. It's so frustratingly confusing, each time I feel like we have a handle on all the complications, 3-4 more pop up. . .

Michigan also has the U-M depression center. Idk if it's open but it has some resources.

t1_fwospqd,2020-07-02 12:27:24,t3_hjw2id,t3_hjw2id,"In January of 1963, buried at the [bottom of the Michigan Daily classified section](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754241/81), the first ad ran for the Michigan Scientific Introduction Service (MSIS). Very plainly it offered to use ""established techniques of personality appraisal and an IBM system...to introduce unmarried persons to others whose background and ideals are congenial with their own."" The service didn't run another ad until September of 1963 and then did so regularly through the fall of 1966. From the Ann Arbor News archives I learned that [MSIS was founded by Michael A. Fortuna](https://aadl.org/N011_1510_002), a 1960 BBA graduate who earned his [MBA from Michigan the following year.](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Michiganensian/A9bmAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22michael+a+fortuna%22&pg=PA426&printsec=frontcover) . . [In this December 1965 issue of Computers and Automation magazine (see page 47 of the PDF)](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/computersAndAutomation/196512.pdf) Fortuna said, ""The fact is that most people put more thought into choosing a cigaret [*sic*] brand than they do in picking a wife or husband"". The article states MSIS obtained around 150 facts from clients ""ranging from height and weight to dominant or submissive tendencies"" and then fed data into an IBM card reader which would return 10-15 potential matches. . . Based on the Computers and Automation article and this [September 1966 article from The Michigan Daily](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754191/173), it seems that just men were provided with their list of matches and their contact information. Women using the service had no agency and just had to wait around for a phone call. . . MSIS was not called out by name in the 1966 Michigan Daily (it referenced the Collegiate Dating Game) article, but the [following week MSIS ran its final ad in the Daily, referencing that article](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754191/228). That 1966 ad is the last primary source reference I can find to MSIS though I did find references to a married couple that is said to have met via MSIS and started dating in 1967.. . As for other success stories, Mina Jo Rosenbloom and Mike Linver met via MSIS in 1965 and married in 1967. They are thought to be the first married couple who met using a computerized or internet based dating service. Mina Jo and Mike have been profiled many times over including by [The Michigan Daily](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/campus-life/time-tinder), [NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46301786/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/online-dating-secret-science-love-first-byte/#.Xvzk7ihKjIV), and this [video produced by the Alumni Association.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hylz968Ilt8)",24.0,error,0.0

""I would rather have gone out with the computer!"" is the comment of Jerry Grossman, '70. This comment expresses the feeling of the majority of students whose opinions were sampled on campus yesterday.. . > ""The problem which arises with computerized dating is not the fault of the computer but rather it is the fault of the students who fill out the questionnaires,"" says Jan Supovitz, '69. ""Therefore, any mismatches which arise are due to exaggeration or outright lies made by the students."" Mimi Bales, '70, agrees: ""Some boys fill out the forms as if they were the ideal date just so they could go out with a neat girl."" . . > Blondes don't seem to have more fun in computerized dating. ""My date called me and all he asked was what color my hair was,"" explains Karen Kartheiser, '69. ""When I told him it was blonde, he said I hate blondes' and hung up!"" Even though the boy eventually - did take her out, Karen vows, ""I'll never go on one of those computer dates again."" . . > Ricki Graff, '69, feels that the computer dating system puts the girls at a disadvantage which the. boys can avoid. ""When a boy receives his date's name, he can check her out to see what she is like; that way he only takes out the girls whom he thinks are good enough for him. The girl. can't do this and must accept whomever decides to call her up,"" she said.. . > How do the boys feel about computer dating? Sandy Levison, '70,""would like to examine the computer system before he would accept the results."" Karl Schneider, '70, believes that the computer dating takes all of the fun out of looking for a date.. . > Sometimes mismatches occur which are difficult to explain. ""I called my date to find out what time I could pick her up,"" relates Dave Willard, '70, ""and I found out that she was two years older than I was and hadn't even filled out the form. It turned out that she and the girl I was supposed to date had the same name and that I was given the wrong telephone number by the dating service."" . . > What type of person signs up for a computer date? Many boys like Bob Ross, '70, feel that ""the girl who wants to go on a computer date is usually one who rarely goes out on other dates."". . > Carolyn Miegel, '70, believes that the situation is just the opposite. ""It is usually the more popular girls who go out on computer dates because they are looking for some variety in their dates. On the other hand, the shy girl who doesn't date often, does not sign up because is afraid that her date will be someone with whom she might not be comfortable,"" she said. . . > Computerized dating services for college students vary greatly in accuracy and selectivity. The Collegiate Dating Game, which most students are familiar with, operates through the mail and relies on the honesty of the applicants. Questionnaires, which were distributed throughout campus, were the basis of matching of Dates. Not only is specific information sought about the students' physical appearances, hobbies, etc., but also about the applicant's social and moral attitudes.. . I keep going back to the story from the student Karen Kartheiser. Not only does that guy decide to call her back, but after he hung up on her the first time, she still went out with him! I found the research on all this fascinating but felt like I needed to take a shower after, just felt gross after being immersed in 1960s dating norms.",17.0,error,0.0

So either way, LSA or engineering, you will have to take some form of non-major courses if you want to leave U of M with a degree, and so I would really make sure you take ones you are interested in as you are forced to take these types of classes, but you have the freedom to choose which ones. Probably the most leeway you will ever have in scheduling is the very first semester, so try to see if you can get a CS class in, some other general requirements, and something that you like that also fulfills some requirement.

Like the flu, some may contract it and not feel a thing, others die from it. Regardless, the general consensus is that the flu isn't the WORST thing in the world, but it is really painful and annoying when you do have it. So imagine a pandemic-level illness with a higher documented rate of death than the flu (as of now). Even if you don't die or even have lung damage, many folks are uncomfortable, in pain, etc. to an extent that it knocks them out for weeks (check out r/COVID19positive for anecdotes). A simple rhinovirus doesn't do that. . . Simply believing that 99% of cases for young people are without complication is flawed because 1) That number has no scientific basis besides a straight up guess, 2) Major complications aren't necessary to cause someone to be bed-ridden for days or weeks, and3) If only 1% of the student population experienced major complications, 400+ students on UM's campus would be affected, not including the 500+ at Michigan State and hundreds more at other schools--and that doesn't take into account the at-risk student groups.. .

Normally we'd write them on paper a decent amount and sort of ingrain them in our memory that way, but on a computer you can just... type them without knowing how they look. It's a bit hard to explain if you're not familiar with one of these languages, but if you're taking another language this probably isn't much of an issue. I didn't really absorb new vocabulary very well either beyond using them for online assessments.. . Our lectures became slides with voice overs to look at in our own time, so ended up being somewhat less engaging. Then discussion classes also were affected somewhat, like in breakout rooms sometimes people just were less inclined to talk without sensei listening in, handwriting things less, stuff like that. Again, maybe different with other languages but for me the handwritten assignments we were usually given helped me a lot with remembering things, considering they're written in a script I don't use natively. Like, classes weren't necessarily _bad_, just... meh I guess. I feel like the in-person atmosphere helped a lot, it just felt really warm and extra engaging I guess? Imagine things like people giving a funny answer to a question and everyone laughing (like in a wholesome way not a mean way).. . I can't really fault them for the way things were organized, especially on such short notice. I always had lots of fun in class and the Japanese department is honestly so great imo, so it's possible I was a bit spoiled. . . . tl;dr: It's really hard to put into words, but I think it just felt more disconnected, which isn't good for a foreign language class when you want to interact and practice with others a lot. I don't blame them for it though, it's just how the circumstances were. This is also a super subjective answer based on my own experience with one language's class.. . edit: I actually forgot something pretty big.

t1_fx9upon,2020-07-08 02:36:22,t3_hn74dv,t3_hn74dv,"Well, let's tackle it. It could be that it's due to most societies, up until the late-20th to 21st century, perpetuating a patriarchal hegemony. So the idea of Women's Studies, is to open insight into a women's perspective through history and culture. They're usually taken in conjunction with other degrees that one would benefit by taking such a class (sociology, psychology, anthropology, etc). . . Capitalism promotes the patriarchal hegemony quite often. (the western view of man brings home the bacon, woman cooks and cleans. The white man heads business, the person of color, or foreigner, is either the side kick or the janitor, and the woman or lgbtq+ person is the assistant. Ring any bells?) Usually as a means of keeping power away from those who want to destroy the class system. . . To answer your basis on it promoting marxism, i'll direct you back to my statement on 'class system' and hegemony. To explain marxism in this context goes like this:. . You have the aristocrats (those who are born wealthy, live wealthy, die wealthy), the bourgeoisie (the middle class, essentially. Those with spare money for expenses and have little worry for debt or basic necessities), and the proletariat (those who have to live paycheck to paycheck and work constantly to make ends meet). The hegemony basically puts strict lines in the dirt to where those who have wealth and education shouldn't be women, a person of color, lgbtq+, or anyone except a white straight male. And for a while that was essentially the norm. Marxism, according to Karl Marx (the man behind the ideology), is simply the dissolution of class. To make everyone equal on a societal level, and that those who have should contribute to society so that the have-nots could be able to live their lives. So in a way, it is, and that isn't a bad thing, at least to most of us.. . But we're humans. We're greedy, and some people simply are too greedy to spare money, because they want the newest gadget, or drive the biggest car, or own the biggest house, or eat the biggest and fanciest food. Essentially, Capitalism enables the yuppie culture the United States has prided itself upon through rose colored glasses since the 1980's-1990's, that is simply getting harder and harder to maintain. And this hegemony enables class divide, inequality, fascism and bigotry. . . Tl;Dr: Marxism is an ideology, not a means of controlling the economy. Capitalism is a very flawed system that promotes The Haves VS the Have Nots, the patriarchal hegemony being used as a means of control on society so that this system can remain in place. It's even imbedded into society that anything other than capitalism is simply 'unAmerican' (again promoting the us vs them mentality). . . So of course they'd talk about Marxism, and i'm assuming Karl Marx, because it points out the hypocrisy of capitalism; even though they say anyone can become big if they work hard enough, the reality is, they will die trying. Most have. . . . . But this is all assuming you actually want a serious answer to your question, rather than asking it to stroke a fragile ego, an ego bred from anti-intellectualism and a dissociation from anything 'politically correct', and thinking that someone from a liberal college, such as UofM, couldn't give a serious answer, and would simply say 'Capitalism bad, marxism good'.. .

I'm taking CHEM 210/211 right now and both classes aren't too bad. Orgo lab has just been watching short 10-15 minute lab videos and submitting about 2-3 assignments (pre-lab, post-lab, writing assignment, etc.) each week. The assignments are pretty straight forward but they do take at least a couple hours to do minimum and grading is VERY GSI-dependent. A lot of lab GSIs in the spring term are also really young (like rising juniors) so sometimes they weren't the best at giving guidance. What frustrated me the most about 211 though is that there wasn't any sort of grading scale laid out for us. It was kind of just a ""do your best and we'll evaluate you at the end of the term"" but I as well as a lot of other students felt really stressed not knowing what our grade was throughout the term.. . For Orgo 1, I personally don't mind the online format for lectures and exams. The class is definitely a big time commitment with 2-hour lectures 3 times a week, 2 1-hour discussions every week, then maybe an SLC study group on top of all that, and most importantly watching Nolta's office hours and doing the coursepack problems. For the past 2 months of spring term I've had no life lol and just did all of that and saw pretty good results on the exams. Honestly, I feel like the exams are a crazy time-crunch but they're simpler and more straight forward than the coursepack problems. In the coursepack, I've come across a lot of small, tricky problems that stem from a previous question but with the online format, Nolta can't really do that (especially with the boxes on a pdf format) and instead the questions focus on testing your basic knowledge of the concepts/mechanisms. The first exam was really difficult because I couldn't write on the computer screen but exams 2 and 3 went much better after printing them out so I'd definitely recommend doing that.. . Since it is spring term and class is already pretty fast-paced, the main thing for orgo would just be staying on top of material and practice problems. You'll be chilling thinking you have a week before the exam but in the blink of an eye, you'll have a whole lecture's worth of material dumped on you two days before the exam plus the previous concepts to master. The 210/211 teaching team did a great job of answering questions as soon as possible though so definitely take advantage of that.

My situation is very similar to yours with credits for multivariable cal and linear algebra. Considering the amount of math you have taken, my suggestion would be to take math 295, which I will be taking in fall. All math students need to take a course in analysis (MATH451) but math 295 covers analysis in more depth. If you want to do math, the rigor and depth in 295 will benefit you. Moreover, combined with 296, 295 would exempt you from math451 and math 217, and with one extra MATH395, you will also be exempted from math420(also a requirement for lots of math submajors). If you are interested in taking 295, just send Prof Stephen DeBacker an email and made a video appointment with him and he will tell you more details and give you permission. He is incredibly kind and willing to help especially if you are interested in math. Dont worry about not yet having an advising appointment cuz you can meet DeBacker without a general advisor (I met him before I had my transfer advising and before I am allowed to register for classes). . . Plus, If you are considering any 400level math, I would recommend 425 which is a comparatively easy one. I took probability at my previous university and transferred it to UM.

Think the Soviet Union, or China before Mao's death. . . Because of this, from my perspective, the hierarchy has simply shifted from the free market to the state. As a result, would patriarchal norms not still apply? Would women not still be passed over for government jobs in favor of men? Would minorities have started to hold positions of power much faster compared to white people, or would they stay the same?

The NEXT semester, when you have 69 credits already earned, at that point you will start to pay upper division.. . This may not apply to you, OP, but I never miss the chance to get it out there: College credits that you earn during high school (through AP or IB or dual enrollment or whatever) are not all equally helpful or wonderful. This comes as a surprise to many because school districts make a big-ass deal about how earning all these credits will save you money and you can graduate early and so on. It can feel like a big triumph to get all these credits! Some new students can call themselves sophomore before they even set foot on campus, wow. . . But the benefits of this are not as straightforward. Those credits might not fulfill specific requirements for the major you want. And because UM charges a flat rate for fulltime enrollment, you don't save money if your AP credits let you take 12 credits intead of 15 in a term. And they can also speed your arrival at the upper-division rate.. . Let me be clear: AP (and other other credits) aren't *useless*. They can help you get into more interesting classes sooner. They can facilitate you taking a lighter load during a brutal term. They may make it easier to double major. And yeah, if it's your goal maybe you can graduate earlier and avoid a term or two of tuition. But you want to use them strategically. You may want to leave some of them off the table and not claim them for credit at all.. . It is possible to de-apply for these credits, and some students have done that when the credit isn't helping their degree program but is making the difference between lower and upper division. You can do this, but it is a one-time thing and you can't change your mind later. For this reason, the registrar strongly advises that you work closely with your advisor to make sure removing the credit isn't a prerequisite for something else you've earned or won't otherwise cause a bunch of cascading problems going forward.",14.0,neutral,0.7970303297042847

Then perhaps the solution is to address why certain minorities are underrepresented rather than artificially biasing admissions towards them - that's one school of thought. Of course the problem with that is that these underlying issues are complicated and challenging to fix, and it might take a while especially if the powers that be aren't concerned with addressing the true root causes.

They've mentioned stuff about separating students into smaller ""pods"" (sort of to simulate a large household like students have off campus) to reduce larger group exposures, and if they come up with a plan for that and it's a plan that makes you feel comfortable, it might be worth it to come back. I will say, there probably won't be large parties anywhere and social opportunities on campus will be reduced no matter what but if they release a plan for the dorms that includes anything other than ""you live in a single room and all interactions are forbidden"" there will be some dorm social life. If it meets your standards for what you want, I would say come back.. . If you can't wait to make that choice (and I will say, I don't think U of M would prohibit contract termination until after they release plans. The window after might be limited, but I seriously doubt they'd lock everyone in before they've said what they intend to do. They're waiting to release plans because they want the plans to be good and realistic, offering what college experience people can reasonably have while remaining as safe as possible. They also don't want to come up with a plan that they have to bail on super early because it ended up being too optimistic, or present a plan that's overly restrictive relative to the actual dangers presented in the fall that people who might have no choice but to live in the dorms are downright miserable for the semester) then I would say terminate. If possible, maybe see if you can terminate only for the fall semester, and then keep an eye on the way things are going when winter rolls around. . . Definitely think about how your living environment affects your academics as well as your social life. Do you feel productive at home? Is it a conducive environment to your studies (if you got any experience with that this spring, how did it go)? A lot of people I know (and people I don't) have had trouble focusing or working well at home, whether it's due to lack of material resources such as strong wifi signals and a dedicated workspace, due to being at home making them feel really removed from college and forgetting the fact it's still a time when they need to be working hard, or because of family reasons (tense family relationships or just a family that's loud/not respectful of study time or space/etc.). Ultimately, you will spend more money if you end up doing really poorly at home and need to take an extra semester due to having to drop classes or not get a grade you need. I'm not saying this is super likely, but be realistic about your own abilities to work at home vs at school. Everyone is different.. . Finally, definitely consider how your desired class schedule fits into this. Are all your classes going to be offered 100% online? Most are, but some lab classes might have to be offered as a highly modified hybrid. Would you need to change your schedule to facilitate everything being online? Are there certain classes or types of classes that it's important to you offer some kind of in person component for you to do your best? Once again, everyone is different and this might not apply to you at all! . . Just remember that while social concerns are really important, academic ones are too. And at the end of the day, academic concerns will probably have more bearing on the financial concerns. Spending extra money for social experiences--while totally valid, the college experience does matter and I'm not denying that, I'm just speaking relative to the current situation where social experiences are more uncertain--is probably going to be less compelling than spending extra money for academic experiences. As an OOS student, you chose to spend extra money (assuming you applied to in-state schools as well) for some combination of these things when you chose to attend U of M. I would look at the reasons you originally chose to come to a more expensive school and look at how those will look in the fall. Did you choose because of the college town, the social life, the sports, the academics or (most likely) some balance of all these things and maybe more? Look at what matters to you and how much of that will be available in the fall and contingent on you being on campus. Ultimately it's a super personal decision but I wish you the best of luck in making it! I hope that whatever you pick, you have a great fall semester and feel happy with your choice :)",19.0,error,0.0

Please go tell the Black student population at UMich that having mostly White and Asian students in EECS is considered a ""bunch of diversity"". The Black EECS portion being only 1.6%. The State of Michigan has about a 14% Black population. So even if the the university and department got to half that at 7%, that would be substantial. The university plays huge in racial gentrification in Ann Arbor. Most students would be very surprised to learn that [Kerrytown and Waterhill used to be historically black neighborhoods](https://www.ecurrent.com/feature/gentrification-and-segregation-in-ann-arbor-and-ypsilanti/) [2](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2018/09/how_ann_arbors_historically_bl.html) The University was the pivotal driving force and influence that pushed Black families out of these neighborhood as they could no longer afford to live there. As a result, fewer Black children were attending local schools (eg.. the Mack School, Community High School, and others). As we know, the Ann Arbor Public Schools are big feeder schools to the University. The average student's family background kept getting wealthier. Enrollment numbers got bigger; more administrators were added; more university building were constructed. Because of the limited amount of land and housing, housing prices skyrocketed. No surprise, the history of the university and the local Ann Arbor government has always been deeply intertwined with many city officials being former university administrators, faculty, or students. The city government bought all the land surrounding the city. A greenbelt got approved which prevents urban sprawl from happening to keep the supply of housing low. Additionally, affordable housing initiatives get voted down. U-M receives several hundred millions of dollars from the State of Michigan each year. A public university should serve the communities in its state, and it is not doing enough for the Black community. U-M should be investing more into K-12 resources for Black families to prepare them for college. U-M has a couple small programs geared towards URM groups, but that's ""took a mile, give an inch"". It does not need so many international students.

My instructor prepared handwritten notes and took pictures of them to show us during class, and he would explain them verbally. I personally found it more helpful when he explaining and writing at the same time, though this could be different for you or depending on your instructor. More importantly, I felt like I was wasting almost half the class time because we were given time to work through book problems in small groups and write our answers in the Zoom whiteboard, but it was difficult to write from a computer and a lot of people stayed silent. This part definitely worked better in person.

The responsibilities of the RAs this year are going to be much greater than normal, in addition to the fact that we will be living *and* working in a hazardous environment. This goes above and beyond the original job description for the job I signed up for, but it doesn't seem that the compensation will increase.. . 2) I'm one of those people who doesn't like to wear a mask. I already have to wear one for 8-16 hour shifts at work at home and I don't want to go to school where I'll have to wear one all day, every day, even in the bathrooms. It's much more comfortable for me and safer for everybody for me to stay my ass at home where I only have to wear a mask at work and for short periods of time like when getting groceries, as opposed to how constant it's going to be on campus. I do not want to go to the library for an all-night study session and have to wear a mask the whole time. . . 3) Going along with that ... how on earth are they going to keep facilities like libraries and other study areas at half capacity (or whatever the mandate will be?) Those places are routinely packed as it is. What that's telling me is that my only option to study a lot of the time will be in my dorm room, because there isn't even going to be space to study in the actual designated areas for it. I'd rather stay at home and set up a little office than deal with that frustration.. . 4) Where am I going to work on campus? The dining hall is going to be mostly takeout only, which will greatly reduces the number of student employees necessary. Will gyms even re-open? I've tried to apply for a library position three times and have never heard back. So much of the South U/State St business shut down that employment opportunities will be limited there, too. I have to pay my tuition and I have a stable job at home that will 100% never be closed down, no matter how bad things get. . . 5) On a frivolous note, I don't want to go back if I can't even really hang out with my friends or go to parties. . . 6) An outbreak is inevitable.

And of course looking at the endowment and things like scholarships does inform budget choices surrounding tuition. Not completely black and white as they'd like you to believe. There were strategies to freeze/lower tuition this year that many colleges employed, just not UM. It's really a balancing game for universities. Do they decide to increase tuition and potentially lose money from lower enrollment. They lose trust from the public this way and quite possibly derail student's lives. Or do they freeze/lower tuition in this unprecedented time and acknowledge the financial struggles many are going through, which might not be as profitable. UMich chose a middle road with less risk involved by charging more affluent families increased tuition only.. . ""1. Increase the *spending rate*. Deploy more of the fund's accrued value for the university's use. This doesn't add flexibility to how these funds can be used, but may provide temporary relief to the university's general fund budget. Spending rates are set by institutional policy overseen, typically, by an investment committee of the Board. Spending rates are typically tied to something like a 12-quarter trailing average of earnings and are sometimes adjusted for inflation. This has the effect of smoothing out the annual allocation to the university, i.e. avoiding sudden spikes up or down with the markets, which would make the endowment earning less dependable and endowment spending more volatile. Increasing the spending rate may mean riskier investments strategies, however, and this can have longer term consequences.. . 2. Consider liquidating (or fully deploying) and *quasi-endowments*. These are generally board-designated and have fewer restrictions.. . 3. Sell-off selected *real estate* or other holdings that may not be part or the long-term endowment pool and provide the flexibility to be liquidated.. . 4. Use funds from endowed *scholarships* first, before using general funds (e.g., tuition revenue) to support scholarships. In some cases, colleges may be forced to change their financial aid strategy at least temporarily. Even the wealthiest universities may need to return to being need-aware rather than truly need-blind.. . 5. Temporarily use discretionary funds, often called *excellence funds* available to the president, provost, or dean to offset the university's general fund obligation to the unit. As with others, this can provide temporary relief as it likely cannot (and should not) become a permanent strategy. Excellence funds provide needed latitude and resources for leaders to invest strategically in their highest priorities.. . 6. Temporarily alter solicitation strategy to focus more on *current-use* funds, engaging donors in this strategic, timely, and more urgent approach to philanthropy.. . 7. Deploy *unspent* funds. This may sound obvious, but Foundation CEO's and Advancement VP's report significant amounts of unspent endowment income throughout their campuses, as deans and others choose to ""bank"" some endowment distributions year-after-year (i.e., saving for an emergency or perhaps far-our long-term spending strategy such as a new building or expensive piece of equipment). Some Foundation leaders report tens of millions, and in some cases more than $100M of unspent endowment distributions being held at various offices across the campus. *Now is the time to activate those funds*. University and foundation leadership should develop an ""underutilized funds initiative"" to deploy these resources as quickly (for example over the next two years) and strategically as possible. This can provide much needed general fund relief AND demonstrates good stewardship of donor funds, especially important when returning to that donor to consider another gift.""",8.0,error,0.0

t1_fxuw3oo,2020-07-12 19:35:41,t3_hpfohn,t3_hpfohn,"A lot of great points have already been touched upon but I'll throw in my take, too.. . I think the answer to this is going to vary wildly from person to person. Only you can determine what's best for you, and more importantly, what your risk tolerance is. Would you be okay if most people on your floor, using the same bathroom as you are, aren't taking the virus seriously and don't care if they get it? In a house/apartment, you probably know most if not all of the people you're living with so you're at least able to discern the tendencies of those you'd be living with. In a dorm, such a determination isn't possible. If you can get out of your housing contract, I would certainly stay home. Yes, that's a huge letdown and not at all what you expected your sophomore year would be like. On the bright side though, you'll almost assuredly remain safer and have another two fantastic (likely normal) years on campus to look forward to. . . If you're locked into a lease/housing contract, I understand the desire to stay on campus. Eating that cost just isn't palatable or feasible for most. There's surely a higher likelihood of getting out of a housing contract than an apartment/housing lease, but I have no idea what those odds are. With that said, the primary reason for living in a dorm is the socialization aspect and there is no doubt that will take a significant hit during a pandemic. I also had a single in Couzens and I had more colds during that fall/winter than any other time in my life. This does not happen to everyone, but communal living/dining/bathroom spaces certainly set the stage for an increased risk of getting sick. I have absolutely no idea how they plan to effectively handle rushes in the dining hall, how to manage the bathrooms, and other communal spaces if someone were to get sick. . . Sure, if you don't go you're going to miss out on some fun, there's absolutely no denying that. However, in absolutely no way will this be like any other year. Tailgates may happen but they won't be the same, most sporting events won't happen and if they do they'll be at limited capacity, going out to bars and restaurants won't be the same, etc. People just need to determine their own personal risk calculus while also keeping in mind their decisions do impact other people. I think this pandemic has really emphasized how individualistic our society is. That comes with a lot of benefits, too, but in times like this, I think we would be much better off if we could just temporarily put that on the back burner.. . At this point in time, I don't see how bringing tens of thousands of students back on campus is a good idea. A lot of people on campus are less likely to adhere to proper mitigation efforts because they're relatively low risk and live with others who are relatively low risk. Even if you are doing everything you can to stay safe, how many other people are you going to encounter on a daily basis who aren't? Many people are out partying, sharing drinks, sharing weed, etc (totally acceptable activities during normal times) acting completely indifferent to the entire thing. This is only going to get intensified with people more densely populated, interacting with more diverse groups of people, and when the weather gets a bit cooler and forces people inside.",3.0,error,0.0
