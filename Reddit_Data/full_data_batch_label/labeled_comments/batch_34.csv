Coming here from a non-rich/""crazy"" background was *jarring*. I was the *only* one of my hometown friends whose parents weren't divorced, and American Eagle was a *nice* store. I remember walking down my dorm hallway one afternoon and overhearing a girl I knew talking about ""yeah after I got my first Longchamp bag,""... My response: ""I'm gonna keep walking cuz 1. what is a Longchamp. 2. how much does it cost. \*whipping out my Android phone\* $450. Awesome. Anyway I'm late for my daily cry about not being able to relate to anyone here."" It's hard to go from ""$20 leggings are a splurge"" to where every girl you see has multiple $100 leggings. Everyone at community college was so much more friendly, engaged, open, and caring. Cry in the Angell Hall bathroom and no one makes eye contact. Cry in a community college bathroom and a girl with hoop earrings will ask you whose ass she has to beat.. . Btw I see ur a new grad, take this, it's got all the career navigation info I wish I'd had coming out of college and it is VERY helpful for figuring out mental health/disability regarding work: https://www.askamanager.org/. . Kinda tangential rant, your comment made me reflect on the past several years since graduating: . . To anyone who sees this and is struggling with a lot, it's ok to take time to find people you can actually grow with/give yourself enough energy to do it. It took taking a semester off freshman year for mental health reasons and coming back later to find friends that have lasted into post-grad. I ran around a couple different circles and removed myself from a couple unsupportive/flaky friend groups to find my people (traumatized mostly middle/lower middle class social butterflies with crazy families heyyyyy), that's just life. It's human nature that like attracts like, and you'll be better off with people who get it. The friends I still talk to, we talk about normal interests but also deeper stuff like attachment styles, synesthesia, how good it is to be away from our families, and how to navigate work relationships when we grew up with 0 healthy conflict resolution skills. None of us have alcohol problems anymore. None of us had the emotional capacity to be able to talk much about our childhoods in college, but as adults with schedules and better boundaries and good insurance plans that cover therapy... phew. And you can make these types of friends as an adult too.. . Especially to upperclassmen/new grads feeling a type of way - life gets better postgrad too. That doesn't help with the ""I want More Friends NOW"" feeling but it is what it is. College is not the best four years of your life, it can be fun and get you away from home, but that is not the end. The first few years post-grad are a struggle, literally no one knows what they're doing post-grad and most first jobs are shitty. It's like being a freshman but in life! But this time you're better prepared and hopefully can become financially independent/stable soon.",2.0,error,0.0

The university will not allow you to get aid for that 1000 dollars. However if your aid doesn't cover up to that 1000 you can receive more aid before they lower your aid. So let's say you have to pay 15000 and you're expect to pay 1000, you have aid for 11000. If you get a scholarship for 4000 dollars making it 15000 they will lower your aid by 1000 dollars so the total aid will be 14000 and you still have to pay that 1000.

t1_iomrmfv,2022-09-16 05:56:56,t3_xfbn9k,t3_xfbn9k,"**Q1**. . I found the stats classes lighter than the math classes on average. The major requires only 26 credits, which is a large plus for students who want to either graduate early or switch majors.. . The undergraduate classes are very reasonable. If I has to rank the classes I took on how difficult I found them when I did them, it'd go:. 306 < 413 < 415 < 526 < 426 < 525 < 610. . I did them in this order so you can gauge how much preparation I had vs how difficult I found them:. 306 -> 525 + 415 -> 413 + 426 -> 610 -> 526. . **Q3**. . I can only speak for the classes I've done. I'll cover the ones I think you'll like given your interest in applied stats, leaving a few keywords on the content that you can google if you want. Most professors I've run into in statistics have been decent-to-amazing at teaching, so I don't think you'll end up with too many bad ones. Additionally opinions vary from student to student, so you can look at Atlas scores (atlas.ai.umich.edu, I think this should be your MSU grades equivalent too) to get a gauge as they'll likely be more informative. . . 306 with Tan Kean Ming had a take-home midterm and a very reasonable final project when I did it. It teaches you R, with a focus on the Tidyverse set of packages, manipulating tables of data, plotting graphs, and exploring a dataset. Very practical, and very useful. This would be harder for students with fewer programming classes under their belt. . . 413 with Mark Rulkowski was amazing. The material (linear regression fundamentals, model interpretation, hypothesis testing, shrinkage, GLMs, etc.) was very useful, and he presented it in the most intuitive way possible. A couple of years later it still sticks in my head somehow. I didn't find it very difficult, but this was more of a function of instructor quality than anything else.. . I found 415 with Ziwei Zhu very reasonable (they were a good lecturer as well, very knowledgeable). Class covers machine/statistical learning, minus neural nets (do 315 if you want to learn about NNs). A few students complained about the midterm that semester, as it was entirely programming and a bit of a time crunch. The final was on paper, so that should have been fixed by now. Try to get a good group for the final project, it was a Kaggle-like competition that semester.. . Other classes you should consider are 315 (neural nets, harder than 415 despite a lower class number so you should have calc 3, probability, linear algebra and some programming done before you take it), 451 (Bayesian methods like MCMC, Bayesian regression and hierarchical models, very useful and very popular), and 531 (time series analysis, autoregressive models, filtering, smoothing, continuous-time continuous-state hidden Markov models, also known as partially-observed Markov processes). I haven't done these, but have either worked with the professors, tutored students in them, or had to learn the material on the side. . . **Q5**. . Mathematics at U-M spills over for the following classes that stats majors often take as these are either commonly or always taught by math faculty:. Calc 1, 2 and 3 (math 115, 116, 215/285), linear algebra (math 214/217), probability (math/stats 425/525, which are dual-listed), and stochastic processes (math/stats 526, dual-listed).. . Most of the complaints against math at Michigan are about the intro classes (math 115, 116, 215, 216, 214), not necessarily the upper levels. . . **Q6**. . You will learn how to code (at least a little) in 306. 315, 415, 451, and 531 also feature a good amount of programming. . . I believe EECS 183 (intro programming) is a requirement, but you should try to do EECS 280 and 281 as well if you have the time. They really help. . . **Q7**. . Finally, you should talk to Gina Cornacchia, the stats undergrad coordinator. She's really friendly and pleasant, and super helpful.",7.0,error,0.0

A 3-button jacket should have the middle button buttoned, sometimes the top, but never the bottom.. . * if you're on the heavy side, it's acceptable to leave your suit jacket unbuttoned when standing. . * There are two types of suits: A 2-piece suit (pants and jacket) and a 3-piece suit (pants, jacket, vest). A 3-piece suit is far more formal and better suited to weddings and funerals than career fairs.. . * Avoid light-colored suits. You don't want to go in looking like Saul Goodman or a used car salesman. The most professional suit colors are navy blue, charcoal gray, and black.. . * Different suit colors are used in different levels of being formal. A navy blue or a charcoal suit are acceptable for a job fair or interview. A black suit may be overkill, but acceptable if you have no alternative.. . * Understand dress code lingo.

Acceptable business casual attire would be dress pants/trousers, a button-down shirt or polo shirt, and a sport jacket or sweater. ""Business professional"" means a suit, and no room to negotiate.. . * Don't go for wild ties. A basic pattern or solid color is plenty, leave the Spongebob tie in your closet.. . * Understand certain colors don't go together, and this applies to ties as well as shirts/pants. Black does not go with navy blue, for example.. . * Don't let the size intimidate you. It's not uncommon for your suit to be a bigger size than what you ordinarily wear.

Get involved with something that is close to student life. Volunteer for a hall council ( if in the dorms), tutor students, get involved in a DE&I initiative ( clubs, jobs, events, volunteer work). As an engineer it was a hard but useful position for me, and it challenged my notions of how to support students of different backgrounds with unique goals.

With its flexible elastomer backrest, there's no need for all those levers and knobs. The back of the chair simply stretches or retracts based on where your spine applies pressure .

The evaluation can be hundreds of dollars or more, and there is a huge stigma around ADHD treatment that can be hard to work against. Additionally while your symptoms may be similar to your roommate, the underlying cause may be the same or different. I don't wish my ADHD diagnosis on anyone, but I do hope you get to the bottom of it so you can take care of yourself best! Talk to someone, get their perspective, and if it doesn't really sit right, talk to someone else. I saw a psychiatrist at the university who was wonderful, but they cannot provide ADHD evaluation. There's have a list somewhere online of local clinicians who do and their approximate cost, but had mine done at Ann Arbor Counseling Associates and they're awesome. I also had my evaluation covered by my student health insurance, which was incredible because they can be so costly. Whatever is going on, you deserve to prioritize your mental and physical health!

I had a hard time making friends in high school (which was a step up from middle school when I had no friends). I made friends easily freshman year because my floor had some pretty chill guys, but when I moved up to north campus for sophomore year, making friends was hard. Didn't make many new friends that year because I hadn't yet learned how and that location wasn't helpful. . . But junior year I was in a house close to central and threw myself into learning how to make friends. And I figured it out. Joining all the clubs I could was part of it. The other part of what goes into making friends is consistency and intention. You have to see the same people enough times (biweekly at least) for a connection to form. And there has to be that intention of befriending them. Both parties have to be interested, but someone has to initiate. If you're in a club enough with someone you're interested in, ask for their number. Ask to hang out. Suggest things to do. Or maybe the club becomes a friend group outside of the group meetings and you do fun things together. I had both happen in college. . . Learning how to make friends is a skill that will last you a lifetime. And it only gets harder as you get older. I say that not to scare you, but as a challenge. It's a code to crack. You got this!. .

I have rules like, I can't buy certain foods unless certain criteria are met. Also, you should read the last bullet point twice because it's super important.. . \-Cardio doesn't actually help you lose weight. Cardio burns calories, but it makes you more hungry. The advantage of doing cardio is that you can eat more food that day without going over your limit. It's also really good for your health so you should probably do it anyway. Weight lifting is a good option for weight loss because it burns calories over a longer period of time (including days you don't lift) and it will lower your body fat percentage, which will also increase your metabolism over time.. . \-You need to understand the three macronutrients (fat, protein, carbs), and also sugar and fiber. Basically, fat = neutral, carbs = bad, sugar = really really bad, protein = good, fiber = good. So, eat less carbs, eat more protein and fiber. Yes, it's really that simple!",1.0,neutral,0.6441840529441833

If you use their website it shows all the nutrition/calorie info and lots of things are low cal and small portioned. For ex, yesterday at lunch I ate a small side salad with feta, a cup of vegetable soup, a grain bowl type thingy, and half of a birthday cake bar with a cup of jasmine tea. I was so full and it was really good- all for around 500 calories. For breakfast I usually eat at home (off campus) and have Better Oats 100 calorie oatmeal. Dinner is usually 1/2 a serving of whatever meal kit I order because I live off campus, but if I lived on campus I would totally just eat at the dining hall. I'm a big snacker (due to weed munchies lol) so I always keep Drizzlicious rice cakes (order from Amazon) which are 90 calories for 21 mini cakes and a variety of low calorie candy (smarties, tic tacs, gum, cinnamon Altoids, pez, fun dip, etc). But I make an effort to save this stuff as a last resort and try to snack on healthy stuff like grapes and carrot sticks. I work out now and then if I feel like it to exercise tapes at home (which might not be an option for you) but I've taken Zumba at Group X and it was awesome. I just live far away. . . Doing all of this (and honestly not anything else, bare minimum effort) I've lost like 15 lbs since June. I believe that slow and consistent changes make for better long term weight loss. I don't deny myself anything and I don't force myself to exercise... I just use portion control religiously and keep myself accountable with MyFitnessPal and daily weigh ins. It's hard at first but you get used to it and I swear it's not that bad. . . But if you try to crash diet, over exercise, or just keep denying yourself foods that you like... you will very likely either fail (making yourself fatter and more depressed, making it harder to try again), or give yourself an eating disorder. And being skinny isn't fun if you're TOO thin/can't ever enjoy food again/ losing hair and teeth/ have shitty nails and skin/ can't sleep or focus on schoolwork/ etc. Trust me. Do it the right way by making slow consistent changes that make sense and make you feel at least semi-good.

So, in a perfect world he gets the med redshirt, stays at Michigan, McCarthy goes pro after his junior year (post-'23 season), McNamara then wins the starting job again, and has two more years as the # 1 QB in '24 and '25. Unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world, and the scenario I just mentioned above, would be quite risky for several reasons. First, McNamara might not get a med redshirt, McCarthy might not go pro after next season (my $ would be on him going pro after '23), but it's possible (but not probable, in my opinion). And even if, at that point, McNamara does compete for the starting job, there is no guarantee he'll win it. So, I think the only way McNamara gets the starting QB position again is if (and I hate even thinking about this one) McCarthy gets injured and has to miss a few games, or worse, the rest of the season. Of course that would depend on how quickly McNamara heals up from his injury (although I think he:'s expected to come back sooner than was initially expected).",1.0,neutral,0.7988678216934204

If you're going into engineering it's extremely time consuming and rigorous. The other majors seem about what you'd expect though. Also I've had a consistently bad experience as far as math classes here go, they run it in a flipped classroom teach yourself style that just doesn't seem to work that well, it's way better if you can transfer it in.. 4.

I've met people who don't even speak English, while traveling abroad, that still recognize this school so if you're looking to go to a school that people everywhere will recognize it's the right choice.

Ann Arbor is a nice and safe feeling city but the traffic is extremely annoying to navigate. But with the campus being as spread out as it is there's no avoiding doing a lot of bussing/biking/driving/walking to get between classes. Winters here add another layer that makes getting to class super annoying. I definitely don't regret coming here though since it will be a major accomplishment in my life when I finish and I am for sure getting a top tier education backed by really solid faculty. I learned way more than I did at my old college in half the time. But I definitely feel like I could have saved myself a lot of trauma by going to a smaller school and I've heard similar sentiment from other people who transferred here.. .

Also, try to meet up with people and just talk regularly/grab coffee or something if you can- meeting up with and chatting with people is really helpful when the deeper winter hits. When studying, study somewhere with other people around, ie Starbucks or libraries like Shapiro (if it's not distracting). Last point, GTFO, and stay TF out of your room as much as possible, for me, staying in my room for more than like 3-4 hours at a time hurts my motivation, mood, and sociability.

Everything on paper could be the same, but you if you got a shit schedule with 45-75 min between each class...it's going to feel a lot more like spinning your wheels compared to someone with back to back classes all on one campus... . you have to make an honest assessment of what you're capable of, optimize where you can, and perhaps cut things. Working 30hrs a week is nuts. You can probably find a job that'll pay 30% more and let you work 20hrs instead. It's a very favorable market for job seekers and I'm assuming that you need to survive on that money.. . Alternatively, would it make more sense to take a loan and 18 credits a semester and get out a lot faster? Every year you're not working at your ""real job"", you're losing that income. Perhaps you're not going in the hole on paper today, but if you take 2 extra years to graduate, and you make 60k upon graduation, that's 120k of lost future wages. It's not going to cost 120k to borrow rent now. Ymmv",1.0,negative,0.623720645904541

Northeastern (job co-op program seemed cool) MSOE (Cool Software Engineering (rather than CS ) program) and some other Minnesota college who's name escaped me. Aside from the friends, Michigan won out due to it's amazing aid package.. 3. The majority of the students here fall into one or more of these groups, and if you're not in a group, it will be significantly harder to find a community here / not feel like an imposter and it'll be harder to find things to enjoy here (people in these groups struggle too, they're just more likely to have adequate background / support systems to get them through, not always) White, Asian, athletes, rich people, (You could absolutely luck out and make friends in your major classes or other places despite not being in these groups, I'm just saying from experience, not being in these groups can come with a huge feeling of being other'd at this school (not always)). Also notice how defensive I am being when I type this out? People here can be touchy (not all) and will try to talk over your experiences to protect their precious school.. 4. Best? Nothing you can find elsewhere. Worse? See 3. Sure other schools have this problem but it's good to know to know if you want to avoid this kind of community. Also, teachers talk about office hours, but they tend to be crowded, even ealy on, so it can be hard to get help, especially if you're not from a strong educational background.. 5. Undergrads? Virtue signaling, think they have all the answers but they really just have a limited perspective and look foolish to those who don't share it, sheltered. There are nice fun quirky dorks who are fun but you only find them in certain pockets of the school, and I wouldn't go here really relying on finding those pockets while dealing with everything else. This place helped me develop as a person, but that was inspite of / because of 3 years of a traumatic mixture of mostly invalidating assholes and limited access to resources to succeed, while dealing with undiagnosed disabilities. Even without that, I still know fellow minorities and others with similar backgrounds who see all the same shit.I just now found a home in this city, living with great people, but I wouldn't go through the last 3years again for one decent co-op house.. 6. Free food events lmao Also Billy Magic and memes. 7. Big, pretty, lots of unique architecture. Classrooms and buildings range in age but nothing is poorly maintained in anyway. No fastfood, most food options are at least kinda expensive cheapest meals are 10 dollars. 8. Dunno. 9. Hard to judge, my time management is kinda poor. I work 11 hours a day Mon-Fri on going to classes, school work, and career stuff as I'm a senior.. 10. Eat at places once a week, . 11. Find the school that fits YOU. Don't chase prestige or go where your flakey online friends go.. 12. Try restraunts, walk in the arb, watch squirells, Video game Archive in Shapiro",1.0,error,0.0

I initially signed a contract because rent was cheap relative to other places (it was $710/month last year, $750/month this year), but after the first semester, I grew to enjoy the community aspect of things. Since there are so many people, you can have it that there is always somebody to do something with if you so choose. Alternatively, you can just live your life in your room/outside of the house and nobody will bat an eye at you (about half of our members do this). Keep in mind that as a new Coop member, you would likely get a double/triple instead of a single (unless you're lucky), though if you find that you like the Coop you live in, seniority will help you get a better room option the next year. . . . If you're really concerned about weed smell, just email the president of the house and ask for a tour. Tours are definitely a good way to get the vibe of the house, and you could also ask to be a part of the house dinner to see how the culture of the house is like (though take what you see with a grain of salt, since house cultures can vary between years). . . . I also find the people talking about lack of diversity of thought to be laughable. As somebody else pointed out, it's a housing cooperative which is very community based, so you're more likely to see people whose views reflect that. However, people are very receptive to having conversations about disagreements. . . . Overall, I would say that if you don't have anything lined up with other people for living arrangements, tour some of the Coops you think you'd be interested in.

In the feasibility concerns, double majors usually allow you to double count some credits, and only needs one capstone, so the total credits needed are not the simple summation. For some natural combinations, it is doable to finish in normal 4 years. For some hard ones, it depends - I did see several of my friends did MechE+CS...Some graduate in 5 or 4.5 years, some in 4 years - The latters either/both worked really hard or/and took courses in summer. Even under the circumstances that two majors are not in the same school, you can definitely work one by one - just make sure both of them are active.. . Pros: Majors really show that you are in this field. Most minors are not that useful for recruiters/grad programs. You can benefit from two majors' resources and tell a really good story with the two majors. You can also have much wider choices of specialization and future work to do - A, B, and the intersections of A and B.. . Cons: It either/both takes more time or/and adds more stress and workload to your university journey. My BS dual took me 4 years, but I have 6 semesters of \~18 credits, and also had summer courses. My current dual adds one more year on my first major. So you do need to think about the potential financial stress you may face, and the time and energy consumed.. .

They trick themselves into thinking they will watch them every day to keep up with the class.

Do not do them a day before the exam, start doing them at least a week before, and do them 1-2 hours each day until the exam. This should be the ""core"" of your studying, anything like videos or reading the textbook should be strictly supplements. . 3) Office hours- After doing the practice problems compile a list that you got wrong or still have questions about.

""... what limits Asian American admissions is not a race-conscious selection process. Legacy admissions, sports preferences and other factors, however, do ... 43 percent of white students admitted to Harvard fell under the categories of recruited athletes, legacy students and children of faculty and staff. That share also includes what's referred to as the ""dean's interest list,"" which consists of applicants whose parents or relatives made donations to the university. The research noted that roughly 75 percent of white students admitted from those categories, identified as ""ALDCs,"" ""would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs."""" .
