The writing was on the wall, but they still had spring break where countless people traveled internationally (a lot to very high risk areas at the time such as Italy, Spain, etc), then had all the students come back for 2 days of class where students intermingled with zero PPE, and then sent us home to our families.

t1_gbiw7aj,2020-11-08 00:44:03,t3_jq0exi,t3_jq0exi,"For me, we need to have a conversation...an actual one. One that allows both sides to be vulnerable. Because these last 4 years have shown me, there are different americas, and they don't see eye to eye. I have spoken to a few of my trump supporting peers. They liked him for the economy. He is a captialist, and under his regime, stock profolios have gotten bigger, especially during the pandemic. I'm not saying that's good or bad, but if you just want to maximize wealth, maybe everything else is secondary i.e. social justice. Others is the converse, but we can't assume every american wants the same thing for america and we need to have that discussion, to explain why other things matter. For example, in large cities, social justice is a big thing because that's what people interact with on a regular basis, however, how many people care about the dwindling blue collar jobs, dying cities due to population decline, or local farmers being abused by big companies in the midwest? Probably a lot of less. Hell, when I lived in LA I didn't think about it, it was only when I started living in smaller towns where I thought about it. It's not maliciously intended, but I can see why people feel left behind when the media is saying you need to have a tech job, or college education or have to be a high powered woman. Some people don't want any of that and we need to make avenues for that as well. It's not a dichotomy. We can still care about social justice and make sure our farmers are taken care of. . . . Another thing white folx can do in particular is sit down and listen when others talk about white supremacy. At UofM and in Ann arbor, a lot of white folx like to think they are 'woke' because of their perceived sense of high intellectualism or they have a marginalized identity that they think they aren't the problem. The issue is, racism and white supremacy isn't just de jure and de facto racism. It's not just structural, systemic and systematic racism either. It's everyday interactions. For example quite a few white queer people will try to speak for the poc, because they conflate their experiences as a queer person for experience as a poc. That is false. The reality is, white people has the privilege of becoming invisible and hide their queer identity \*if\* they choose to. Poc don't have that luxury. There is a fundamental difference that isn't surmountable. And that's fine. Just understand the limits of your own experience. Don't speak over those who have the experience. When you do (even when well intentioned) you are contributing to white supremacy. It harkens back to age of imperialism when white people were deciding the fates of poc, as if they (white people) know better than poc. Stop. . . . Additionally, because U of M has a lot globally ranked programs in psychology, sociology, social work, politics and more, graduates and students foolishly assume they know more they do. And sadly it's hubris. I can't tell you how many dates I've on been with a budding sociologist, or social worker where she would try to talk about issues affecting the black community. It's great you are learning about this on a conceptual level, but understand that academic knowledge isn't a substitute of lived experiences, understand just because you go to U of M 'smaller' colleges aren't as well versed to talk these issues. Anecdotally, I come from a community college, and although I don't have the terminology U of M grads have, I can talk miles around most when it comes to social justice, because I am from the areas they read about. Please stop gate keeping, and don't look down on other because they may not have the degree or come from wealth. Again, when you do, that's white supremacy at work. . . . A 3rd thing, is don't yeet someone just because they don't tell you what you want to hear. Just because someone may disagree with you on how to approach a solution, doesn't mean there's irreconcilable ideaological differences. As a poc, I do find police can be problem, but I wouldn't go as far as saying ACAB, which apparently makes me toxic in the left, but when I don't say Blue lives matter, the right wants to get rid of me too. There is a middle ground. Policy isn't zero sum. . . . I have more ideas as well, but I'm tired of writing so let me stop here.",2.0,error,0.0

Giving yourself a few semesters to work on a research project is super valuable and will make for a good thesis + you won't feel rushed writing one because a lot of the work would have already been done. Timeline wise, the semester before you take the thesis course you will want to fill out that form. This entails writing a proposal and finding a second reader who will sign off on your thesis. . .

Whereas other game programs are spread across multiple production-related courses, UMich students have one course and four months to go from ""never made a game before"" to ""competing for internships with MSU, EMU, etc"".. . While we do succeed at this (and many of our students are in the industry now), this has an effect on the course's difficulty curve-- we must ramp up Unity knowledge quickly (to the level of recreating either a Zelda NES dungeon or Metroid NES region within three weeks) so that we may pivot to focusing on game design, higher level design patterns, and other critical topics.. . Fortunately, the course becomes much easier after that first project (first few weeks of the course), as (1) students become equipped with design patterns to make their software production vastly more efficient and (2) The project objectives are chosen partially by the students, as they now control their games' design (some game designs simply require less time investment than others).. . Students who arrive with time-management discipline and prospective project team members typically report a smooth experience in the early weeks (and throughout the course). The course's early weeks can provide a rude awakening for those unprepared (though everyone improves and ends up in a good spot by the end).. .

My name is Nyako (not really), and I've been on a non-traditional path since after high school. This led to a life of painful struggle these last 7 years. I've learned to take things as they come and cope well, but this semester has been incredibly difficult due t o loneliness that had to be endured, the insane amount of work all of my well intentioned professors have put on me and every other student. This occurred due to different department heads deciding this should be the amount of work we do and material we learn while the world continues to go belly side up. We students had no say in that are i n a much more vulnerable, unstable position. Many of us don't have jobs to support ourselves and must keep our grades up despite our mental health just so we can eat.. . I beg of you. Please, Please, deeply consider the P/NRC option for this semester , with all that is going on in the world, I speak for a large percentage of the student body when I say, we need this option. Those who do not want it can opt to reveal their grades like they could last year. . .

They're pretty vastly different spaces, but that kind of thing only becomes clear after the fact.. . ---. . Here's a very biased answer from a high-level digital circuit person:. . Analog design (usually) tends to be a pretty manual process in terms of doing layout by hand, running a lot of simulations to verify the transient behavior of your device, etc. A lot of analog design is focused on sensors, e.g. temperature, chemical, MEMS; converters, e.g. DACs and ADCs, or oscillators, e.g. PLLs / DCOs. You make a small device and spend a lot of time tuning it and optimizing it.. . Digital design can be either partially automated or fully automated task, depending on whether you focus on lower-level or higher-level tasks. Lower level tasks would be things like hand-designing non-CMOS circuits or other full-custom circuits (although full-custom design is pretty rare these days, IMO). Higher-level tasks would be something like full SoC integration.. . IMO in lower-level tasks you spend some of your time hand-designing circuits and a lot of time writing scripts to do simulations. In higher-level tasks you do a lot of time writing scripts for automated algorithms and a lot of time trying to debug performance problems (Why is the power consumption for this circuit so high? Why is the critical path so slow? etc).. . Also there's mixed signal design, which - you guessed it - is analog and digital together.

The Humanities take so much undeserved shit at U of M and in academia in general. I found it hard not to internalize that, but our skills and perspectives are valued and important. Can I ask what your major is?. . For what it's worth - I graduated with a double major in Creative Writing (shoutout RC!) and Anthropology straight into the Great Recession. My first job was in corporate sales; I hated every second of it but it got me to Chicago. I had a stint doing copywriting for the same company (CareerBuilder.com, they were great to work for but I am not a salesperson lol) and then worked with a recruiter to land my first nonprofit job. Definitely not necessary to work with a recruiter to do that, I just happened to work across the hall from their office.. . I've held a variety of fundraising roles over the last eight years, and found my sweet spot with grants management. I earned a Master of Public Policy from DePaul and am now working on combining grants stuff with immigration policy advocacy. Not to say that everything has been easy. I've never made over $55k/year, I have an absurd amount of student loan debt, and I lost my job due to depression/anxiety last year (got a new one so it's all good!) Most importantly, I'm happy, because I stay true to my strengths and passions. I like people, I like telling stories, I like working on big social problems with fellow altruistic nerds.. . In my experience, your major truly doesn't matter when it comes to work after graduation. GPA actually doesn't matter either. What matters most is how you tell your story - about your skills, values, passions, grit, how you approach challenges, how you handle difficult people. This comes in networking and in your cover letter and interview, and just takes some work to refine and practice. I got the ""what are you going to do with that?"" question about my major all the time in undergrad. My response was ""whatever the fuck I want"" while internally screaming in existential dread. But trust me when I say this Michigan degree stands out. Employers notice it. At my previous job (UChicago medicine fundraising), several people in senior leadership were Wolverines.. .

If you're applying as a freshmen and already knew, say, you wanted to do Ross or School of Info, it just sometimes can make it a little easier to designate that from the start, or sometimes it just does nothing, can't hurt you though.. . Residential College is a weird little sub-program nested within LSA. It has some extra requirements, but plenty of people just get tired and leave and do normal LSA stuff. It's hosted in East Quad, though, always seemed pretty groovy but oddish but a solid community? Similarly though, if you're not familiar and just pass on it, it won't be any huge loss on your end; it's almost kinda niche.. . Re: the letter...

My capstone prof has 3 students in the class (6 if you can the thesis students that meet half the time). I have been struggling like hell this semester for many reasons. Most recently it has been my SOs stalker ex who keeps making out anxiety shoot through the roof. Since April my SO has had significantly increasing anxiety. First Covid, then her sister being hospitalized with a brain aneurysm, then going to a treatment place for eating disorders, then getting kicked out because insurance dropped, then hair falling out, then law school starting, then having to change therapists, then having to change them again because they were a piece of trash, then crazy (abusive now diagnosed schizophrenic) ex trying to get back in her life and find her, to not being able to do her work under this amount of pressure and anxiety and that spiraling on itself with finals coming very soon. I have my own problems sure but my SO is the most important person in my life (whom I live with currently). It's not just Covid, it's not just life, right now nothing feels normal and the motivation to even look at my work is nonexistent. I share this because people like you (and my capstone prof who only even knows the last two points from that list) are the people giving us students some inkling of hope. My sister used to be depressed when she joined the peace corps as a teacher because she felt like she never made a difference. I used to tell her that if you change the life of one person it was worth it. I know not much of this relates to you but what I'm trying to say is that no matter how much you hate the system you are confined to, remember that any amount of difference you make in the lives of your students is what counts. It is the caring and understanding teachers like you that make the profession so honorable. No one will ever understand the extent of what their students are going through especially during Covid (lots of posts on this subreddit about the loss of loved ones) but to ease our burdens, to comfort us in any possible way, to fight on our behalf when all looks grim even to you, that is the meaning of respect above all, that is the meaning of being honorable, that is success.

I chose to only transfer 22 of those.. . The reason I chose not to transfer some of the more useless credits is because umich bases tuition on your completed credits. When you move up to 55+ credits, you're considered an upper level student (even if you're still in your second year of your program, like I was when I started at umich) and tuition costs about $2,000 extra per semester.

Do you mean to say that some U-M students don't know where their next meal is coming from, or live at home with abusive parents? Covid infection rates on the U-M dashboard indicate that a total of roughly 2,500 students have become infected with Covid, out of 31,000 undergrads (99% of students who test positive are undergrads.) But you are saying that a third of your students have become ill or have to take care of a sick family member. Why do you think the rate in your classroom is so high relative to the rest of the student population? I am not suggesting that they are catching Covid in your classroom; contact tracing has already proven that students are not catching Covid that way.

The Carnegie standard for 12 credit hours for full-time, roughly equates to an expected 36 hours of total schoolwork (in and outside the classroom). If you cannot muster 36 hours, you should not be a full-time student. You should be part-time and get a part-time job. I know that, especially as an EECS student where we have some 4 credit classes where the average student is spending 30+ hrs a week on that class, students here can greatly pass 36 hrs a week when enrolled in less than 12 credits. This is not a failure of the financial aid regulations, but with the University's failure to follow federal education guidelines. The solution is not give more money for part-time students but fix the day inconsistency in number of hours per credit. Otherwise the credit hours is pretty meaningless metric. A case-by-case basis per student per specific class is not a system possible to manage across the nation. This is why we even came up with credit hours in the first place.. .

Additionally, you didn't answer my question, why choose to work so hard instead of picking a community college? Your lack of response to that question ""is laughable and really shows you have little exposure to society"". . . . ""If you cannot muster 36 hours, you should not be a full-time student. You should be part-time and get a part-time job."". One of my examples for why people shouldn't stop recieving aid was literally so that they could work more if they needed to? If you need to work more, it's because you don't have enough money. So then your reasonable response to this was to say ""yes, give them even less money now that they are trying to catch up by working more""? What if someone is working more to cover what their aid doesn't and that is affecting their time for schoolwork?. . You said ""muster"" like people who can't do that aren't trying, and are lazy. You keep insisting that you are stating the ""harsh truth"" but your wording goes beyond harsh, you're straight up judgemental, you speak with assumptions. It's okay to do that, but at least own it. People have lives, things happen, situations are not universal and I don't think aid should be either.

My bad, I should've clarified. I meant count that towards your particular argument, not towards being fraud. It is obviously fraud. . . ""leaving out my logic"".

I was talking about your responses to my statements with generalizations. . . . ""There are exemptions in law for medical issues."". Then you should also know that these exemptions are complicated and don't fit every situation. Apparently having thyroid cancer and needing to be in the hospital for months doesn't count as being ""extremely sick"" by those same exemption standards. Sure, this is one example, but if this was a case that wasn't included, then how many other 'unique' cases are also not covered? . . ""Yes, the manner which people speak in regards to financial aid makes me believe many people feel entitled to the money (I also seen many veterans do this for disability as well)."". If this is the case then I don't think we have a similar stance on what 'entitlement' means. I took it by it's literal definition. To have a legal right to something, which people who have aid do have a legal right to it, as do veterans for their disability. They do not 'feel' entitled to that money, they are legally entitled to it. . I am assuming you mean to say that they feel they are deserving of it, simply for existing, and if this is the case, then I'd have to disagree with you on that perception. It is true in some cases that people want to be handed everything in life, but I don't think wanting to actually learn and perform well in school/have a class load you can handle is an example of that. . .

I've taken EECS 203, 280, and 281, and also MATH 215 and 217, and I still feel ENGR 100 was the most stressful class I have taken. I was in the underwater vehicles section taught by Laura Alford. The section was very well taught - Laura is so passionate and energetic, and Robin Fowler, the Tech Comm instructor, is like your mom helping you to get through it. However, the workload was exhausting - you'll have to meet 3-4 times a week with your project team. You'll have several 10-20 page technical papers to write, as well as presentations you have to give in front of people from industry they bring in (we worked closely with BP). Despite the work and stress, it is a class I look back on nostalgically. . . On another note, EECS 280 is my favorite class I have ever taken. The organization is impeccable, the material is interesting, and the projects are awesome (specifically projects 2 (computer vision) and 5 (machine learning / NLP) ). I am hoping to IA for the class next semester. . . In conclusion: choose just ONE of EECS 280 and ENGR 100. I'd recommend just getting E100 out of the way, and it will probably be a little easier online than in person. I actually took EECS 280 in the spring semester which was awesome, so I would consider doing ENGR 100 in the winter and EECS 280 in the spring. . . P.S. EECS 203 is a clusterfuck of a class. The organization is terrible, and although the material is interesting, the way it is taught makes it miserable. If you love math, I would recommend taking MATH 217 (coolest math class I have ever taken) and then MATH 465 instead (however if you don't enjoy math, 217 / 465 will be miserable as it is highly theoretical and proof-based).

If you get a glucose meter (different than a1c test) you can also do daily testing at home. to see how different foods affect your blood glucose. Look online for a guide to what your numbers should be but generally you want to be around 100 when you wake up (before you've eaten), below 180 an hour after you eat, and below 140 two hours after you eat. If your morning fasting number is above 126 you're considered pre-diabetic and should go to a doctor.. . A basic a1c meter is cheap, like $20-$30 at any pharmacy but the test strips can be expensive, like a buck or more each. (They come in packages of 50 or 100 but you'll get a few included with your meter.). . Hope that helps.",1.0,neutral,0.8498014211654663

Ideally, you want to have questions that are as unbiased as possible and do not ""lead"" someone to a particular answer. This is especially important if you're going to be coding the data and running it through a R-squared/correlation coefficient. If your questions are biased, your data is going to show virtually no correlation between the two independent factors, which will disprove your hypothesis about a correlation.. . * Your demographic information is incomplete and inconsistent.

I was an undergrad at U-M back then, and I'm now a 6th year PhD student (still at U-M). As we graduated into a ruined economy and every news story was about how yet another bank had failed and more people were losing their homes, my two best friends here couldn't find full-time work: one ended up teaching English in Asia for a year and the other took a job as an administrative assistant. 11-12 years later things look a lot different: turns out the economy came roaring back; those two friends now manage large teams of people at well-known companies.. . Obviously there are major differences between 2008 and 2020 (and in many ways 2020 is worse) but the ironic callback of feeling like the world is collapsing outside our academic bubble is not lost on me. I do think one of the things that has changed for the better is that mental health issues are taken much more seriously now. On the other hand, those mental health issues (like imposter syndrome created by social media, etc) are real.. . One of the biggest problems I've come to recognize in myself and others is what I call ""the difficulty of getting started"". It happens when you have a major goal with a deadline, and the amount of work is almost unfathomable. (It could be an EECS project, or a term paper, or whatever.) The hour of work you could put into it now feels insignificant compared to the dozens or hundreds of hours you need to spend on it over the next few weeks or months... so instead you tab over to Instagram, or Netflix, or whatever.. . You asked for specific advice, so here are my suggestions:. . 1) Fully embrace the idea that you can get better at something with practice, and that struggling with something is the first step to getting better at it. There's been a bunch of research on this recently called ""growth mindset behavior"". And from middle school to college, individuals who believe they **can** improve at something **do** improve. Those who believe intelligence is fixed, or that they are inherently bad at something don't improve (or don't improve as much). . . 2) Address your non-productive behavior metacognitively: ask yourself why. Like if you find yourself on Disney+ in the middle of the day, ask yourself, ""Am I doing this because I have free time to catch up on the Mandalorian? Or am I just looking for something to watch because I want to procrastinate things I actually should be doing?"". . 3) (This is the big one for me) - If you start taking even the smallest measurable action toward your goals, you'll eventually find you achieve some sort of outcome that you're happy with. Stressed out by a big homework problem set? Just solve the first problem for now. Oh, you worked on it for 10 hours and couldn't solve it? Well, now you know you need to do something about that - office hours, talk with classmates, think about switching classes, etc. Fully engaging with the task is the first step to either accomplishing it or refocusing and doing something else instead. If you procrastinate, you never fully address either the task or the underlying issue preventing you from doing it.. .

I've since gone on to law school at another institution..... and all my first-year law classes are online. Hopefully I can give a unique perspective because of this.. . I wouldn't pay too much attention to the disparaging comments to be honest. It's all too easy for someone to criticize others when they're hiding behind a mouse and keyboard. They don't get it, and they never will. They don't understand what you're working through and working against. They don't understand the struggles of parents yelling at each-other during class, or the lack of quiet workspace, or the disruptions to internet in rural areas, or the other dozens of issues that each person is uniquely tackling this year.. . That said, the most important thing is to **be good to yourself**. School is stressful enough, and now we're throwing a pandemic and online learning on top of that. Do things that make yourself feel good and improve your mental wellbeing. One way to do this is to get fresh air -- we may be under lockdown, but that doesn't mean we have to hide in our homes -- you can get some fresh air in your front/backyard, apartment balcony, or whatever. It really helps, and that 5-minute breather does wonders for you. Here are some more tips:. . * Prioritize assignments. This is a big one, and one I definitely had to re-learn for law school. Make a list of your active assignments. Rank them according to due date. Give yourself an estimate for how long each assignment will take, and add ~10-25% of that time on top of it. When you finish an assignment, unless you're feeling really good about yourself, use that remaining time to take a break. For big assignments, chop them up into smaller pieces and spread them out over a few days. For example, don't just dedicate Friday to writing your 5-page paper, say ""Monday I'll do the research, Tuesday I'll write the abstract and intro, Wednesday I'll write the analysis, Thursday I'll write the discussion, and Friday I'll write the conclusion and edit."" This way, you're not giving yourself mental fatigue by focusing on one task all day.. . * Write. It. Down. My memory has been shit because of online learning. I cannot remember any due dates, office hours, review session times, anything. To cope with this, I've been writing all this stuff down. Post-It notes are great for this, I jot down details and slap them onto my work space. If you feel like you're struggling to remember important times, start writing them out (and don't rely too much on online calendar services).. . * Paying attention in class. By now, a lot of students and professors have realized something: It's a *lot* easier to hide cellphone/computer usage during class when we're online. A lot of professors aren't even having students turn their cameras on, so literally nobody is watching us. It's way too easy to *think* you're going to passively listen while you browse the interwebz. I'm not going to tell you ""don't browse the internet during class."" You've heard that enough times and you know it already. *If* you're going to do that though, be smart about it - set up a recording device (I highly recommend OBS Studio, since you can lock recording to a single application instead of your whole screen) so you can play lectures back if the professor doesn't provide recordings.. . * Separation between workspace and leisure space. This ones tough right now. Most of us don't have the luxury of a home-office. We're having to make do with what we have. A lot of us probably converted our gaming setups into an ad-hoc study space. This has created a lot of problems for people trying to focus on homework, and trying to relax when you're done. When you're using the same space for such different tasks, your brain is more or less getting confused about what it should be doing, leading to anxiety. What's important, is to have some sort of physical separation between where you do your work, and where you relax. Basically, avoid doing your homework where you would normally do your gaming. You can still do this even if the only viable ""lecture place"" is your normal chillzone. Create some sort of ""difference"" that allows your brain to turn off from study mode. What I did, was I purchased some cheap cardboard and bamboo skewers (large poster-board works great) to create a ""cardboard wall"" that encompassed my desk. During lectures, people can only see my wall behind me. This wall, in turn, creates that necessary ""difference."" I set it up for lecture and studying, and take it down at the end of the day. It's really done wonders for my mental wellbeing, as odd as it sounds. As a bonus, classmates get really tripped out by it lol.. . So, to sum all this up: Don't care what others think - they'll never get it. Prioritize assignments, write stuff down if your memory sucks, record lectures yourself if you know yourself to be easily distracted, and create a separation between work and leisure.",6.0,error,0.0

t1_gdte7ax,2020-11-27 23:59:45,t3_k1r07m,t3_k1r07m,"Hello Lisa,. . I am a graduate student in the college of engineering department. While may other users have already added great input, I hope I can give you a perspective as a student, who transferred from a small community college to an R1, a working engineer and now as a graduate student at U of M. . . . First it would be helpful if you posted what you wrote to the professor. Without it, and left to my imagination of using only the professor's reply and your subsequent response, it seems like you are projecting onto the professor and your email was trying to instigate, intimidate or patronize the professor. From my perspective, the professor is very professional and on top of that, very patient with you. He explained his teaching philosophy to and offered a pathway for your son to improve. That is not sarcasm, infact, the professor is being quite generous. As a parent of a student and not a student yourself, he has no obligation to you, and could have elected to ignore you altogether. . . . . Next, I understand you are dissatisfied with your son's performance and dissatisfied with how the course is being run. That is perfectly valid; you are entitled to your opinion. However, there is a wisdom with this teaching philosophy - which is, preparing your son's critical thinking skills. Since your son is in Calc 2, I presume he is a STEM major, and if there is one thing you need a stem graduate is critical thinking skills. I can assure you, regardless of where your son goes to work, there will be a problem that is not nicely structured for him. . . . Highschool and even community college math is so much easier because most of it is plug in play. I remember my AP calc courses saying find the derivative of 4x, or integrate 4x\^2+2. During these days we were only learning techniques, and success was determinant on how well you knew how to apply these rules. I suspect your son can do this well due his high marks.. . However, upon transferring to university, problems are no longer plug in play. They are much more open. The formulas aren't always provided for you, and often you have to decided what kind of problem it is before you can even decide how to solve it. And this is the hard part, especially; when you are learning it for the first time. It hits everyone differently. I remember my first set of midterms.... I was below average in all of them. The skills I developed up to that point, served me well, but I didn't have skills to help me for future success. I had to learn these new skills. And it's hard! You have to start something new and different, in a set time, and hope you develop mastery before the next test. . . And you son is still transitioning. Granted, things are more difficult now, because of the pandemic and because of remote learning; however, just because your son isn't doing well now, doesn't mean he will never perform well. . . Moving on, university isn't an exchange of...tell me how to do something and I'll do it. A good university should provide their students with the tools they need in order to succeed after university. This means developing skills outside the core class. This means, learning how to ask for help, finding supplementary material to learn with the main material isn't working out. Practicing longer hours to master your craft. Having the tenacity to continue, especially when things aren't going well. . . . This means, you can not intercede when your son is not doing well. Your son will not be able to advocate for himself if you are doing the heavy lifting for him. He needs to develop these skills for himself. If he does not, he will have to develop them later in life - which is often the more difficult and painful route, especially when companies and post graduate programs expect him to already have these skills. . . My suggestion for you is allow your son to fail. He is in a new environment and needs to learn how to adjust to it. He will become a stronger person, and will have gain skills, that will make him more successful later in life.",11.0,error,0.0

Socioeconomic mobility in the United States refers to the upward or downward movement of Americans from one social class or economic level to another, through job changes, inheritance, marriage, connections, tax changes, innovation, illegal activities, hard work, lobbying, luck, health changes or other factors. This vertical mobility can be the change in socioeconomic status between parents and children (""inter-generational""); or over the course of a lifetime (""intra-generational""). Socioeconomic mobility typically refers to ""relative mobility"", the chance that an individual American's income or social status will rise or fall in comparison to other Americans, but can also refer to ""absolute"" mobility, based on changes in living standards in America. In recent years, several studies have found that vertical intergenerational mobility is lower in the US than in some European countries.. .

I'm not sure whether I want to double major (or minor) in math, but it's a possibility. I know 217 is required for math, but I've also heard it's much harder than 214. Also, almost all 217 sections are already full (including Schneider, who I've heard is really good). If I take 214 now, would it still be possible to double major/minor in math? Also, I know 217 is more about theory/proofs/etc, but what are the other major differences, if any? Would I be disadvantaged by taking it instead of 214 in some way?. 2. Engr 100. Which remote sections were good this semester? I really wanted to do the drone one but I'm remote next sem. Other remote ones that seemed nice to me are 960/970 (which I heard was boring this time because there was no real project), 320 (data science), 560 (robot paintbrush), and 800 (pizza).

Every day a new struggle. Constant anxiety. Like wading through chest-high mud with a ball and chain strapped to your nuts and a crocodile nipping at your ass. Goddamn there were days I didn't think I'd make it. Truly, honestly, I was convinced I would never graduate from that fucking place. . . I was a semester shy of doing it when I totally broke down. I had to go home and lay on my brother's couch staring at the ceiling for three days like an infantryman with PTSD. Total nervous breakdown punctuated with random bouts of crying, usually when I remembered how much German homework I had and how little German I understood after three goddamned years of taking classes. It was awful. . . I finally turned a corner when my sister was trying to console me one night, and I remember her saying something like, ""You don't have to graduate. Nobody will think less of you."" . . And I was like, ""**What did you say?** Nah... fuck that. FUCK THAT."" . . My brother dropped me off in Ann Arbor the next day and I graduated later that year. . . You didn't come this far just to come this far.

Nearly every institution has a policy requiring you to take about half your credits at their campus, even if all the courses you took on other campuses are transferrable. So you could be setting yourself up for an even greater delay in graduating if you enroll in a third institution (depends on how far along you are).. . You should follow up with this, but give yourself a little bit of time to come to terms with this so you can advocate for yourself in a calm and persuasive way. This is upsetting for sure, but in my experience having an upset frame of mind can impede finding a solution.. . With all due respect to a very helpful and wise /u/purpleandpenguins, I want to make sure OP's expectations are appropriate: the ombudsman is unlikely to have the power to restore credits if they were truly awarded in error, but they may be able to help advocate for a process to restore some fairness here or get someone to look at them again. Credit is a religiously-guarded faculty governance issue and some departments have proven very difficult to budge on stingy transfer credit policies. But given the circumstances, maybe something can be done.. . The case may not be whether UM's transfer credit policy is ""correct"" but rather that when a staff member erroneously told you that your credits were good, you made an enrollment decision and invested time/energy/tuition at UM based on that information. That puts you in a bind not of your own making. This is what I would come back to, this is the backbone of why you need some help--a mistake by someone at UM (not you) gave you bad information that influenced your enrollment. In this case I think someone owes you a chance to have those credits very closely re-evaluated to see if they could be deemed eligible for transfer (even if they didn't seem to be based on some standard policy that UM is following).",13.0,negative,0.7663755416870117

Dr. Lau is a super nice professor, but his teaching style doesn't really work for a lot of students (including myself), so I would watch the lectures at 1.5x speed to get the gist of what he was talking about and then do a bunch of past exams. One tip I have is just to do a bunch of past exam questions because the weekly quizzes are modeled like the past exam questions. Also, the class doesn't really have a GSI, but has Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULAs) that offer about 4 practice sessions a week where they go over past exam questions. I would recommend going to 1-2 of these as they are really helpful. This is what I recommend doing for 135, as this is what I have been doing and I am surprisedly doing well in a physics class.

I accept why this might feel, to a student, that this is some kind of scheme to generate ""profits"", and we can agree to disagree on how that plays out given how the University operates.. . ORiginal reply:. . I am a little familiar with dual enrollment as this has been a contentious issue in the state for decades. . . Can you explain what loophole you mean? This article explains one of several changes the state mandated (it used to be that UM wouldn't accept dual enrollment credit if the class was mostly high schoolers, as they describe) but doesn't describe another change, which is that UM also disqualified ""double dipping"" credits (that is, a credit that counted for both high school credit and college credit.) Now UM accepts those too. But what remains unchanged is that the legislature does not mandate that a University has to wholesale accept all dual enrollment as transfer credits. Is that the ""loophole"" you mean? Or is there something else? . . For many students, dual enrollment involves them taking a class or two. Denying those credits could be a money grab on campuses with no threshold tuition pricing. But UM gets the same tuition whether you take 12, 15, or 18 credits. There is only financial gain if it makes at least a semester's worth of difference. That could affect any student who took entire semesters worth of credit AND whose credits could credibly be denied under current guidelines. It sounds like it has happened to you; how many students are affected, I wonder? How many additional semesters of school are students forced into by this? And again, the faculty who make the decisions about credit transfer are not paid some kind of bounty for denying credit. Where is the *financial* incentive for faculty to do that? Yes, UM gets more tuition dollars from some students through dual enrollment credit denial. But does that mean that those extra terms are the driver in faculty decision-making?. . I can't quite see yet see how the adage ""PROFITS (sic) OVER STUDENTS"" applies in this case. Like I said above, I suspect some arrogance comes into play.

Absolutely coming from a place where you don't have to pay for all of if any of your tuition helps, but I don't understand why you would pay for 18 credits a semester at a school like Michigan if it would be financially detrimental to you when you could dual enroll or take some classes as a CC for a fraction of the price, or if you're OOS just go to a school in your state that would cost half the amount. Loans and interest are concerning but there are absolutely economical ways to attend this school without losing your schedule to the max. . . And I think if you get in a situation where OP is where they just can't do it anymore I think it's okay not to push yourself too hard. The boundaries for an 18 credits semester during a normal year are somewhat set, but during a year of remote learning they're extremely fuzzy and can result in some very bad situations where professors expect you to do even more now that you're home, as I remember seeing on this forum about a particular math class.. . As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression I very much disagree with your last statement. I generally dislike gatekeeping mental illness but if the way you ""achieved mental health"" was by pushing yourself even harder then I don't think you had a very typical form of anxiety/depression. In those situations, holding difficult goals you're struggling to achieve with the looming threat that if you don't acheive it you're going to be financially ruined for the rest of your life is only going to make things worse as it feeds into a negative loop. There are many better ways of achieving mental health, from lightening your load, to seeking medical or therapeutical intervention, to taking a gap semester to regroup, or more often all of the above.. . Edit: OP mentioned in other posts that they're doing this to save their parents money. I'm sure they could just talk with them and see what they think, if they're really concerned about it.

Normally a raise would go into effect in September, but this September everyone's salary was frozen as to what it was the year before. The exception was made for unionized employees because their raises are in their union contract.. . I saw someone else say that raises were merely ""postponed"" for faculty; I had not heard that. At any rate, at some point the University would probably like to make up for this year's freeze with better raises in a future year, but pandemic recovery is going to be with us for awhile so that would be hard to make happen budgetarily. It's unlikely the state appropriation will go up by much and we've all seen how keen people are to pay more tuition in a pandemic, so the resources aren't there to give raises big enough to make up for a missed year.. . In an ordinary year, faculty raises are usually a little higher than staff raises. That's because there is a national competitive market for faculty and that is less true for staff.. . Bonuses: Some staff can be given one-time bonuses (instead of raises). Perhaps this happens for faculty but I don't know. This is a cheaper way to reward staff because it is one-time money and doesn't increase their salary base for future years and it doesn't impact salary-based programs like retirement matching. That said, bonuses have been discouraged by leadership (although I know this is sometimes ignored). Bonuses are supposed to be used on rare occasions.

Math, gen chem, physics, etc. Stuff that was or should have been conceptually digestible but was brutally difficult in practice. . . I think it's a combination of factors. In huge lectures (my math 215 class was >100 ppl), it's difficult to convey topics in a way that will make sense to everyone, so you kind of just have to throw the gist of the matter on the whiteboard and hope that if it doesn't make sense, students will come to office hours or math lab - of course, math lab being staffed by underpaid and uninterested grad students and 200-level courses being a low priority for most professors, these resources end up not being as helpful as you'd want. . .

I don't know if it's something intentionally done on the university's side, or some sort of unconscious holdover from days past where such mentalities were more prevalent and accepted, or just a factor of it being really hard to convey complex topics to lecture halls full of hundreds of students. Probably some combination.. . I always thought the formatting of Calc 1/2 and calc 3/4 should be switched - for 1/2, a GSI teaches a classroom of 15-20 students, whereas for 3/4 you get giant lecture halls. Always seemed backwards to me.. . What I can tell you is that if you can just get through it, the path gets easier (or at least, difficult in different ways) later. I did horribly in calc 3, and ended up graduating with honors. In upper level classes, what I found was that the concepts were much more difficult, but the grading was far more forgiving, a total reversal of how it is for the ""weeder"" classes. Also, in those courses its way easier to establish relationships with your instructors and get more value out of office hours.. . If you find yourself in similar struggles with similar classes, I suggest online resources like Kahn Academy or other YouTube guides. There's even a channel on YouTube that does all the problems in Physics 140/240 web work with work shown and explanations (different variable values but the same problems). If you can, see if you can shell out some money for stuff like CourseHero, Chegg, and WolframAplha Pro accounts. Those types of resources can help keep your HW grade up high enough that you can survive a had exam, and you may learn enough through them that the exams are less brutal by the time they roll around.. .

If the dorms are full then you should probably look to find someone subletting an aparrment/house room for a semester, which you will almost definitely be able to find, and it will probably be cheaper than usual since people usually take 10-20% off the price to gurantee it is subley and they don't lose 100% the cost.. .

It's just really unfortunate that code written a month ago by someone else, which can be terribly structured not necessarily wrt the project but wrt to adding new things, will affect your grade on a final exam taken only by yourself (especially when it means the projects are worth more than listed technically since they are also worth half the final/midterm).. . In comparison the normal handwritten exams where you are guranteed everything outside of it will work, makes the benchmark much clearer for the amount of work each student will have to do.

You have a lot of options when it comes to potentially leaving the program and they could help you navigate those.

Of course the circumstances are nowhere near the same as yours, but many students that start a PhD find themselves facing similar second thoughts. There are also Rackham staff you could speak with if you wanted an opinion outside your program. . . You could consider taking a medical leave of absence which can be approved for up to two years. During this time you aren't making progress towards your degree and are not funded (more in a sec on that) but keep your spot in the program. You could be working elsewhere during that time. And if in the next two years you decide you want to give it another shot, you can just jump back in. If you decide it isn't what you want then you can just discontinue. . . Since there could be a gap between taking a leave and getting a job, it's worth noting that right now Rackham is making sure students on a medical leave have continued GradCare coverage.

I hated it during my sophomore year. I hated it during my junior year. I hate it right now. And I am very likely going to hate it whenever it arises in the future.. . I am a loner and perfectionist by nature, and have a difficult time trusting other people to do things right. It's a personal flaw, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. When it's **my** grade on the line, I want it to be representative of **my** effort. Period.. . The majority of my classes involve writing essays, a skill at which I generally excel, and my grades reflect that. I've grown confident of my abilities to put out quality work with minimal interference from others. I've always been at my most comfortable when I have **maximal** agency over the quality of my work. Everything about the grammar, word choice, paragraph structure, syntax, etc. is fine-tuned and tweaked until I am personally satisfied.. . So, group projects are incredibly stressful for me.. . How can I trust others to have such a dedication to their work? Maybe this is a blow-off class for them and they don't care as much as I do. Maybe their skills differ from mine. Maybe they have stuff going on in their lives that prevent them from spending as much time on their work as I do. I try to be understanding, but it's hard.. . How do I stop myself from nitpicking every single little detail from their contributions to the group project? I have to stop myself because my gut reaction from seeing others' work is ""this is not how I would have done it/phrased it/written it therefore it is wrong!"" even if there's actually nothing wrong with what they've done. I'm paranoid.. . When I offer criticism, I *try* to do so in a constructive manner, but everyone always takes it personally (I'd like to think I don't but I probably do too), and thus I have been ""trained"" to not speak up even when I think this part should reeeeeally be changed.. . Maybe it's because I'm asocial and have a hard time ""clicking"" with people in general. I don't know. But I do know you're not alone in hating group work.

Use that as a guide to pick a major out of CS and whatever your other major is (if you need to pick). Even if I wasn't sure I wanted to go into a CS-related field vs. PPE, I would probably still pick the former because of the hard skills you can get from a CS degree, vs. the soft skills taught in PPE that - while still important - are easier to learn in industry when compared to knowing how to code, for example.",2.0,positive,0.49191564321517944

It sounds like the Stone Age, but in fact it was still the case about 20 years ago.. . The rule remains in place despite the fact that professors, in addition to their original job responsibilities, also perform the tasks of data entry staff these days.

I find that 203 either makes sense or it doesn't and for plenty of people, myself included, it doesn't, so you end up having to spend a decent chunk of time on it.. . 203 advice-- attend/watch the lectures regularly (MOST IMPORTANT imo), go to discussion, start the hw early, and go to office hours as much as you can. Also, as a heads up, the exam reviews are super helpful and I also had a better experience attending them live. For remote learning, discussion (at least the one I went to) had really low attendance but the IA will go over examples of problems that you'll see on hw/exam and it's a great chance to practice doing them and definitely will make you realize if you don't actually understand something you thought you got in the lecture. After submitting your homework, actually go through the solutions and make sure you understand what you got wrong and how to do the problem and you'll be in much better shape. I also recommend keeping track of the hw stdev (they come out in Gradescope ""your hw has been graded"" emails) to have an idea of where you stand in the class in case grade reports are super late like they were this semester.. . 280 advice-- take advantage of the lecture notes they have online! Super useful and ngl if you skipped a couple of lectures you can probably fill in the info to do the project just with the notes + Google (not speaking from experience, nope, definitely not). However, doing great on the projects absolutely does not mean you 100% know the material that will be tested on exams. Lab (the class) is really great to really understand even if you thought you already figured it out after lecture. There are also lab assignments (they were worth points when I took the class last winter, though that may have changed?) that are pretty easy even if you don't actually understand the material, so be aware that doing good on the coding side doesn't mean you really understand the stuff that goes on exams. Projects are doable in a shorter amount of time (like a week, not two days, and it sucks, but it's doable) but if you can get started earlier definitely get started earlier. Get familiar with the spec and the starter code they provide for you. Also, the debugger is your best friend! If you didn't really use it before, this is a really good time to start.. . As a side note, I think these two classes did a pretty good job transitioning to online learning (especially compared to some other classes I've heard about/experienced) although of course it's still hard to get into the right mindset when you're at home instead of in a lecture hall. Good luck next semester!",1.0,error,0.0

There is a solution to the situation in which a student loses a family member to COVID. The solution is to allow that student to drop out with no penalties, and allow them full monetary reimbursement. To my understanding the school already does this on occasion. It should have been made easier and more widespread. Or it can be done on a teacher to student situation.. . The solution is not to make grading easier, because not only does that not accurately assess a students skills and education that they earn in college, but it is unfair to other students and past graduates.. . It's not only me, but also other current students who work hard for their A, and to have the same GPA as a student who got a C but marked it as an A is just wrong.. . This only bothers me because employers rarely look at grades, but from time to time do look at GPA. It is wholly an unfair situation for many people, plain and simple.. . And again...

Students can still want to continue their education even after a family member has passed. Often, they just need the time and help to recover. The problem in this pandemic though, is that many students are not just losing one parent but sometimes both or they end up losing someone else close to them. We shouldn't lose compassion because the job market post college is a dog-eat-dog-world. These students maybe do need monetary reimbursement but often from what I have noticed and understood, students in these situations need understanding, time, and help to catch up on academics and life. I'm not sure you understand that the grief from losing someone can vary from person to person so someone who is in such a situation can have a full depressive episode and it is often hard to recover from losing someone. Once again, students shouldn't have to throw out their future because of unprecedented circumstances. Because you graduated earlier, you might never have went through schooling in the middle of a pandemic or at least, you didn't go through it this far. P/F is not grade inflation, it's just letting students understand that there is a back up option in case they need mental time for something else. Also, employers most likely will be able to see that graduates went through school in the middle of a pandemic and will thus anyways even without the GPA or P/F system will be able to understand the situation of the graduate. You're acting as if you were under the same circumstances as students schooling in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic and didn't get the same grade adjustment when in fact, you were not. You didn't go through this while in a pandemic and thus you were not given a P/F option during most semesters.

I know I started off my first two years not being able to relax after finals because I was so live wired all the time, but through my junior and senior year (currently just finished the semester, one more to go) I have been more able to shut off and relax. Part of this comes from senioritis and not giving a fuck, but also from experiencing summer internships that after you leave work, you're done and don't have to focus on it (usually). It's harder to maintain a work life balance while in school because assignments are always due and you have to always work towards projects and exams vs in work you only work during the 40 hrs you're paid to do so. . .

As many of you know, the first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines arrived Dec. 14 at Michigan Medicine in the first step of a massive effort to vaccinate all University of Michigan and Michigan Medicine faculty, staff, students, and patients.. . We will eventually vaccinate everyone who wants to be vaccinated. Currently, vaccine supplies are limited so the COVID-19 Vaccine & Therapeutics Taskforce (CVTT), a multi-disciplinary team of experts, has developed a prioritization for distribution based on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.. . To facilitate this process, all faculty, staff and students should complete our Blue Queue questionnaire. Blue Queue is the official tool for all U-M faculty, staff and students to indicate they would like to receive the COVID-19 vaccine through the university. The questionnaire asks to identify:. . * Your interest in receiving an invitation to schedule the vaccine; you can also indicate that you do not want the vaccine at this time. * General health information and information about your role. . When filling out the questionnaire, answer everything to the best of your knowledge with the information you have available. Some questions may not be straightforward for every one answering so it is okay to answer as best you can.. . [**CLICK HERE TO ACCESS THE BLUE QUEUE QUESTIONNAIRE**](https://mmheadlines.org/2020/12/covid-19-vaccine-questionnaire-for-u-m-faculty-staff-and-students-on-all-three-campuses/). . You must log in using your uniqname and UMICH password (Level 1 for Michigan Medicine) to complete the questionnaire. This is a new questionnaire so please be sure to complete it, even if you previously completed a survey related to COVID-19 vaccines. Completing the Blue Queue questionnaire is the only way to receive an invitation to schedule a vaccination.. . It is important for all faculty, staff, and students to participate so we can administer all available doses and vaccinate as many members of our community as quickly as possible. Even if you do not yet know if you want to receive the vaccine, please complete the questionnaire as soon as possible. If you change your mind about receiving a vaccine at a later date, you can resubmit the survey and change your response.. . To learn more about the vaccine or if you have questions, please visit the [COVID-19 vaccine frequently asked questions](https://mmheadlines.org/2020/11/covid-19-vaccination-planning-faqs/) page. These questions are updated frequently so be sure to check for updated information.. .
