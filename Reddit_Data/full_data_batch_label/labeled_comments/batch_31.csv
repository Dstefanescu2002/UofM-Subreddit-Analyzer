Testing out usually entails meeting with the chief program advisor and convincing them that you're ready for EECS 281.. .

A strong background in Biology 172 is very good and oftentimes can carry you in 310. . In terms of exams, they weren't that bad as long as you didn't procrastinate, and actually understood what you were learning. I found that using piazza as a tool to ask questions, and answer other students question as a great way to study, as oftentimes peoples questions are very eye-opening to topics. Do all types of practice from problem roulette, the textbook recommended problems, practice exams, GSI worksheets, lecture quizzes, etc. UTILIZE ALL RESOURCES. . .

That is a general rule of thumb, so most of the content in the FE is stuff you're pretty familiar with and would only require a bit of review. . . . Also, from what I've heard, there are some states that allow you to take the PE exam before you've gained 4 years of experience, so you could theoretically take the PE after you pass the FE while everything is fresh in your head, then gain 4 years of experience and become a certified PE. However, I would be careful with this approach because if you move states before gaining the experience, you may need to retake the PE exam even if you passed it the initial time. . . . From how I look at it, becoming a certified PE is not the worst process since it's just a couple of exams (compared to other non-engineering disciplines that need to take more exams) for a total cost of around $700. You may even be able to get your company to reimburse you for the PE exam. When it comes to opportunities, having certifications and things that make you stand out could push you over in getting a new job, so it's definitely easier to take the FE now and then decide later that you don't want the PE than the other way around.",2.0,neutral,0.7964779138565063

Both the digital courses you mention perfectly suit my interests! One question I have is regarding the difficulty level of the courses. I have a decently strong background in front end design so would it be advisable to skip 470 and directly go for 570? I don't want to punch above my weight, but at the same time there are certain other topics that I'd like to cover within my credit limit.. . As for the biomems course, Yes! It is definitely something I'm interested in. I'm interested in joining(hopefully!) the labs of a couple profs with research projects in that area (Prof. Yoon, Prof. Flynn)..

North campus, so basically always a drive required. I actually have friends who live out of town ask me to pick up an order for them whenever I visit, it's that good.. 2. **Sharetea** \- Big fruit selection, great taste, particularly love the Peach kiwi green tea, my go-to when downtown.. 3. **Chatime** \- Big fruit selection, but leaves me with a worse gross aftertaste than I find myself having at Sharetea for some reason. Used to be my go-to before Sharetea opened.. 4. **Ding Tea** \- Bubbles aren't as great, flavors are okay but nothing special, I also think it's aesthetic is kinda ugly but still not my least favorite shop. 5. **Quickly** \- The drinks itself taste incredibly lackluster, but I love the snack selection (though it's a bit pricey). Egg waffles, Mochi waffles in particular. Nextdoor to pinball petes too, ready for a good time.. 6. **UniTea** \- I'd consider this more of a dessert shop than a Boba shop, but wasn't a huge fan of it. Girlfriend seems to love their ice cream, though.. 7. **Sweeting** \- Haven't been here in a while since the Bubble Island days, don't remember anything being great and doubt much has changed. At least there's rolled ice cream (again, pricey).. 8. **Moge Tea** \- Little to no fruit selection, and what I tried didn't really appeal at all. North campus too, albeit a more accessible parking lot.. 9. **Tea Ninja** \- Tried it twice, unspectacular, I also think the aesthetic is a huge eyesore, nothing to note here.. .

t1_i94vanp,2022-05-18 23:05:50,t3_uslgfp,t3_uslgfp,"Hello Fanny! I am neither affiliated with MRADS or Honors, but here are my opinions. In terms of dorms, I think Mojo is better than South in terms of amenities. As people have mentioned, Mojo does have A/C, which is really nice for the first few weeks on campus. One of my friends lived in Mojo this past year, and he really enjoyed it :). Location is definitely a plus! I lived on the Hill my freshman year, and I really enjoyed it. Palmer Field is great, and the dorms are close to CCTC (if you have any classes on North). This past year, I often went to the Mojo dining hall. But I think most important part is the ability to meet new people in the dorms. From what I understand, you will be put onto the same floor as MRADS/Honors program members. I don't know how this affects anything, but I think either dorm will be great to meet new people.. . In terms of the program, I think MRADS might be a better choice. MRADS does help you get research positions, similar to UROP (if this is something that you are interested in). I think this experience early on in your freshman year can help you in the long run. I was a part of UROP last year, and I really enjoyed doing research. If this is something that you know you want to get into or are interested in trying in, I think MRADS would be great (along with the Mojo housing). I am not too familiar with the Honors program, but from what I have seen, it seems like you have a few different requirements, and you have to take a certain number of classes. I took COGSCI 200 in Fall 21, and there were a few people who did this honors project (if they wanted to declare COGSCI 200 as an honors class). I think this may contribute to one of the requirements for the Honors program. However, on thing that you could also consider is obtaining Honors for your degree. I am a computer science major in LSA, and there is an option to declare Honors if you meet the GPA requirements and complete an Honors thesis.. .

I can't speak for every class but honestly I think that most of them will be in a pretty similar spot, besides maybe non-code based classes like 376 and 203 since I'm not too sure how they handle stuff over there. . . I also feel for students who get honor coded without having actually done anything, but these cases are not the norm, and there is NO way we can get around all false positives. That's why there's an honor council process, and students who have nothing on their record yet have it expedited! I really do sympathize with you but I think you're talking a lot about things we already know and have accounted for. We know that students are gonna get similar advice in office hours, we know that students are gonna look at stack overflow, we know that FRQ problems on the exam only have so many ways to solve them and the line limit can mean solutions look similar. This is all accounted for, and we don't just send out reports based on MOSS reports automatically, they are all looked through by hand and considered. Again, I can't speak for other classes.. . I think most people underestimate how *different* people's code looks with these more complex problems at higher level classes like 281. I like comparing it to handwriting, even in solving the same problem in the same way with all the same ideas, people's code will still look different! The HC reports we send are very egregious and quite obvious to someone who has been working as an IA and looking at a lot of different implementations of a certain set of code for awhile. Having exactly the same code and just changing the variables from 'max' to 'biggest', even on a line limited exam problem, is more than telling. We also have other methods we use to check for cheating outside of code similarity as well. I don't know what class you're referencing or what the exact case is but I am certain that everything we personally send out is almost certainly cheating, or if it's not, is still overt enough that we would be wrong not to send out the report. You say it's not especially uncommon, but I think it is (at least on our end), it's just that there are a lot of EECS students out there and they take a lot of classes, so it's not too unlikely that you'll personally meet someone but those false positive reports are quite unlikely. I would also try to be critical of anyone's supposed innocence, people tend to not really want to admit to fault with that kind of stuff. . . . That being said I have a lot of complaints with the honor council in general and how they handle things, and I really do sympathize for how frustrating it is, whether you're innocent or not.

It's more important to talk about why doing research through UROP would help you with your career goals, regardless of your background.. . However, just some friendly advice if you'd like. I did UROP last year as a sophomore with no prior research experience. My thoughts on the whole thing were, while it's great for people with little to no experience, if you already have something, I highly recommend just researching some professors and other lab PI's in your field of interest online, and cold emailing them about possible positions (what/why you're interested, etc.). The reason is, I thought UROP would be giving you a lab, but you still end up cold emailing professors looking for research assistants, just in the class. While UROP has some good time spent with resume building and cover letter writing, I think the weekly seminar you have to go to, plus the additional assignments they make you do to obtain the grade you want are huge wastes of time. Personally, I wish I had just taken the time to look into people myself and emailing them with my resume, as that would have given me the same thing UROP did, without the huge time waste, and I think that'd be easier for you to obtain a position seeing as you have a lot of experience.

It requires hardwork, and even before that making sure you get into classes since the upper level course get booked fast. Money is not easy to come by, but you need balance the pros and cons of the overwork and potentially not getting credit during a semester if you burnout and don't pass. Burning out is okay and happens to a lot of us in CS, but just know this method will make it more likely to happen.. . **Note:** if you're in LSA since money is a concern if possible DO NOT DECLARE until the semester you are taking 281! Declaring for CS as an LSA student will change your tuition charge to match engineering, there aren't any apparent benefits to declaring early. But make sure you do before your enrollment date when you want to enroll into upper levels because declaring is required to enroll into those.. . **Onto speedrunning:** . Requirements may have changed but for a CS Major specially you need 280, 203, 281, 370, 376, I think 4 uppers (16 credits) and a capstone (capstone can count towards upper credits).. . People I know who have done the CS speedrun will do 203 and 280 together. Then the next semester do 281, 370, and 376 together. Then can do two uppers per semester the following year. An alternative to two uppers per semester is 3 uppers in one semester and taking the 4th in a spring/summer term. Now that is 4 semesters or two years to get the CS classes out of the way, not including other requirements. The 281, 370, 376 semester will be very, very heavy. 281 and 370 are project heavy and conceptually harder for a lot of students. 376 is an annoyance for a lot of students as well and in my experience requires time dedicated to the office hours in order to complete most homeworks.",1.0,neutral,0.4980410039424896

Generally there are two ways companies evaluate technical questions:. . 1. optimal solution/algorithmic approach. This is where optimal solution does matter and you are usually coding in a text document where the code is never executed and ran. Minor syntax errors and even some logic errors are forgiven but that depends on the interviewer. There is more leeway to BS things since you don't run the code if you communicate your thinking well for the optimal solution, but as always try and get it 100% correct.. 2. live coding environment. This is a shared online IDE where they will evaluate how you code and debug in real time. So syntax errors and the logic does matter. If you run out of time (which will happen at some places) and your answer is not complete, it is on you to explain the theory of your answer to finish with a solution. Generally in this type of interview they care more for you coding up A solution, and worry about it being optimal later.. . However, this is very much company, by company. Some companies will tell you (i.e. Coinbase) that they do not care about optimal solution, they want code that actually executes and works.

They ask that you do them two weeks before your orientation date. I don't think it's critical, but that's the ask from the COE advising.

The one exception is the language tests which can allow you to skip the LSA requirement (I know, you're COE but I thought I'd mention this part). . 2) fill out the advising questionnaire/survey. They want that one week ahead of your advising appointment. It asks basic info such as AP credits you have already, anticipated scores, questions you have for the advisor, etc. . . 3) my kid went in and created a 'backpack' of classes just to get an idea of classes they wanted to take, times of day for the classes, etc. You can look at ""rate my professor"" to see if there are sections of a classes that you want to get/avoid ;). . 4) make a 4+ year plan if you're bored. My kid has three alternate plans as guidelines. They are considering dual majoring, doing a semester abroad, and potentially participating in SUGS, so it's complicated to plan out correctly. There are sample schedules in google sheets on the advising sites. My kid likes to plan and then validate it rather than just trusting someone else to create the plan from scratch. . . 5) know any class *exceptions* you want to ask for during advising. For instance, if you have extensive coding experience but no AP result in CS, you can ask for a eng-101 waiver into 280 I believe. Search around the uMich site and you'll find the form/diag test.

Feel free to skip to the end if you only want the most helpful tips.. . 1) Go to optional discussions, use the free tutoring where available, and do homework during office hours. I'm not sure what you're going to be taking, but for all of my math, eecs, and stats classes, the homework would be very tough until I actually learned the topics. Easier said than done, so how do you learn the topics? Go to office hours and discussions. Talk the topics out with the instructor or ta, and answer if you were to teach the class, how would you teach the topic you just learned about? For discussion, at least for stats and eecs, a lot of it is going over the lecture material again. Even if the topics seem super clear, still go. It's very easy to get out of the school routine. As for office hours, I started doing my homework (not projects, mind you) only around office hours. It's very easy to clear up little misconceptions that you have, and often if you ask ""is this right?"" the instructor will say yes or they will tell you where you went wrong. This is definitely the number 1 time save in the weekly work load. . 2) Weekly studying. This is probably where you're going to spend the most trial and error. If you need to read a textbook, learn to read a textbook. There are plenty of videos on youtube or articles about it, but I would say keep notes on your reading, and write maybe 1 or 2 key ideas from every paragraph for non math textbooks, and do every example problem for math ones. Especially for math, being able to do the example problems without looking at the solution will help you out miles down the road since the homeworks will cover much harder versions of the same problems. When it comes to lecture, I like to write one or two sentences about exactly what that lecture was about (think learning objectives if you ever did those), and then one or two exam style questions. These questions form the basis of your study guides for exam time. Another small thing I do every week now is to redo homework problems I get wrong the week the grades come out. For eecs, that is usually a week to two weeks after the due date of the homework. It forces you to actually learn from your mistakes (rather than just acknowledging you made a mistake) and then it also keeps you engaged with earlier parts of the course. It is very easy to forget what you did 3 weeks ago.. . 3) Exam Cramming. If practice exams are out there, start early if you can. Redo the problems you get wrong (and if you get them wrong again, do them again). It's very easy to trick yourself into knowing a subject if you don't try to solve problems without help or looking at a solution in my opinion. My favorite way to study for exams is to spend 30 minutes or so and write absolutely everything I can remember, then use my notes/previous lecture material to fill in gaps, and then do it again. I don't like rewatching lectures or just reading notes, I find it too passive and not productive at all. If your class has discussion problems, try to do discussion problems without help. And if you haven't already done so, redo the homework problems you didn't get right.. . 4) Doing homework. The nice thing about homework is that you are forced to do these essentially ""free"" practice problems for your exams. Again, do your homework in office hours, it's a lot easier to engage with the material if someone knowledgeable on the subject is nearby. If this isn't possible, then at least find a study spot and study group. I tutored at the math lab for a couple months this year and the most successful students were those who would come in with a group and get comfortable with the material.. . Sorry for the info dump, and by no means am I doing all of these all the time, this is just what I have found to be the most helpful tips I can come up with. I think all in all, for a 17 - 18 credit workload (which is what I have been taking pretty consistently), I still am able to keep at least Friday afternoon - Sunday mornings open, as well as hanging with friends for a couple hours every day. Exam season will always be different, you should definitely study more then, but overall the experience is definitely doable. The biggest time save was definitely going to office hours and discussions, and making your lectures go a little bit further with 10 minutes of reflection works wonders on what you actually get out of your courses. I would highly recommend starting with a light course load, make some friends and make some memories! It goes by a lot quicker than you realize :)",4.0,error,0.0

I can't imagine they won't eventually get the SI minors into LSA because that's, like, what, half the damn university?

The list below were the things I picked up mostly my first semester in the kitchen, and if you learn those you've got some range of basic techniques and can grow from there:. . * throw pasta in a pot, boil at til soft, use a strainer to get the water filtered out and then it's done. Usually mid heat like a 5 or 6 is sufficient, and don't neglect it and wander off cus stuff can boil over. If you can boil water you can also make mac and cheese.. . * rice is pretty similar, measure out X cups of water, bring to a boil, dump in X/2 cups of rice, put a lid on, drop the heat to low, and just wait for the rice to soften and absorb all that water. . * eggs are cheap and versatile. Learning to crack them, then beat 2 in a coffee mug and dump it onto an oiled pan, throw in some shredded cheese, flip, got an omelette. Eggs you'll wanna do over low heat, like a 3. I lived on almost exclusively eggs that first summer of the pandemic, lmao.. . * get one of those george foreman folding grills for burgers and chicken breasts, phenomenally easy and useful, you spray nonstick spray on top and bottom, throw shit on, close it, and wait til it's done. If a folding grill is outta price range, you can cook 'em on a pan too, just not /as/ easy, just fry X minutes, flip, fry X minutes on the other side.. . * baking is super formulaic so just grab a box of cookie or brownie mix at the store, add the ingredients it says, mix the stuff in a bowl, plop globs on a sheet or in a tray, wait, boom, you bake now. . * got a slowcooker or access to one? Those are all about easy, most recipes are ""throw these 5 things in a slow cooker, set to high for X hours or low for Y hours, and that's that"". . From there you'll have the basic techniques down and you can just start googling and youtubing things you enjoy or want to make. I just learned meatballs last week and they turned out pretty dope.. . Bonus Tip :: Learn the safe temps for different meats, and get a decent meat thermometer to take out the guesswork for healths sake. I've had friends get way sick on undercooking their stuff.

I'm not too certain about adding classes after they start as I have not tried that.. 2.

You are only registering for fall classes at your advising appointment but you can also ask questions about what to take in the future. I recommend you go online and look up a sample schedule for computer science I found that super helpful when trying to figure all of this out because I could just delete classes on the schedule and it gives you an idea about what order to take the classes in. . 3. As mentioned in answer 2, you can look up online ""computer science university of michigan sample schedule"" and you'll find a website that has it. You can also ask your advisor for help every semester on what you should take. They are there to help but I haven't found them extremely available after you declare. . 4. I don't recommend you overload yourself I've found about 15/16 credits is a good amount but it's definitely something that takes a couple semesters to figure out what you can handle. Do about 15 for the first semester.. 5. For this there are two options: . When you navigate to backpacking there is an option for schedule builder from there you just look up a couple classes and attempt to build a sample schedule then it'll show you times that work for the classes you choose. . Alternatively you can go to the ""Lsa course guide"" and look for classes in a specific department and it'll show you all the available classes including the time. . 6.

Like others have said, you need to respect time for the projects. Your outcome is determined by whether or not you're motivated to start the projects on the day they come out. Even if you think you can finish them quickly, then just start early and get it over with. I'm my case I'd often start projects on spec day, and be done in 3-4 days at most (exception being 482), and have the rest of the time free or to study for the exam without worrying about anything else.. . A good mantra would be, if you don't have a 100% on the projects, you're not done. The averages are high for a reason. And much of the time, exams use code similar to projects, so put the toughest parts of the project directly on your note card (especially true for 485...). . And lastly, don't skimp on partial credit. The graders are just students and the rubrics are set up to give points, not take them away. So spill your brain out on the written portion and don't leave anything out, even if it's pseudo code (which they will often take, especially 482).",3.0,neutral,0.7670711278915405

I wasn't able to kind of intuitively pick it up the way that a lot of others could, so it took me a lot longer to do the homework and labs and made lecture hard to watch (watching recordings was better for me since I could pause). . . I see so many people that are like ""oh it's super easy, super light work load, just review the notes and you'll be fine"" and everything along those lines but I didn't find stats to be as easy as what those people said. There's a lot of equations and a lot of variables that mean a plethora of different things and I found it difficult to keep track of and identify those variables. Not to mention the fact that the GSIs (at least mine) are very very picky with wording, so it was frustrating to get docked points for an error in wording rather than an error in the actual stats part of the question. . . All of this being said, I still managed to get a B in the class so they really do make it very easy to pass but I just had a hard time actually understanding it and conceptualizing it. Looking at what you're considering for the fall, it seems like you've got a good understanding of (or at least ability to do) higher level math that I definitely couldn't do, so I think you'd be fine in 250.",9.0,negative,0.7215508222579956

My only guess is that it has to do with the relatively unforgiving grading distribution coupled with a general antipathy towards math.. . My situation is very, very unique, but hopefully will give some reason to relax. . . I'm a returning, nontraditional student in my 30s finishing up my undergraduate degree. I haven't taken a formal mathematics class since 11th grade Trig circa 2001 (and I don't remember a thing from the class outside of SOHCAHTOA). Also, this was in the pre-STEM era, where there wasn't the modern emphasis on mastering those subjects by the end of high school. Furthermore, here are my math placement results:. . ""Math Score A: 11 %ile: 6 . Placement: Math 105, definite recommendation"". . I didn't bother with 105 and I am taking 115 right now in the Spring and doing very well. And this is a 7-week hyper-accelerated course where we basically burn through a chapter or more each week, halfway drowning in the material. . . If you're worried, I'd recommend taking it in the Winter when the grade distribution will be more forgiving than the Fall (and Spring/Summer, for different reasons), based purely on the types of students taking the class.. . I rolled the dice with that and took it in the Spring where less than 30 people are taking the course. Based on the grade distribution, I think 3 students will receive an A, and maybe 3 or 4 more will get an A-. Right now, I'm in the A- range and can live with that. In a term like this with so few students, it only takes a couple who are solid in math to destroy the curve, and there are definitely a few of them. But, the benefit is that you get through it in half the time. . . As long as you have a foundation in Algebra and are willing to put in the work (do tons of practice problems and exams, go to office hours) you should be fine. . . I should also mention that I got really fortunate with an excellent GSI, though honestly, that only makes a marginal difference and shouldn't make or break the term.. . Anyhow, what I'm saying is that you ought to worry less than you are. If you take the class, take it seriously, and put in some work, you should be fine.

This one has no arbitrary bound on that---this third-iteration backend is optimized to minimize memory usage and should accommodate millions of combinations.. 2. Atlas doesn't rate schedules by your preferences. For example, if you strictly want daily classes to start as late as possible, SchedOpt.org will display the schedules with the latest possible start times first. (Schedule 1 / x is the best scoring schedule, and you will see it upfront. They are sorted from most preferable to least preferable.). 3. Diverse types of preferences, worth highlighting. It can estimate the distance you have to travel every week going to classes and highlight the schedules with the least travel distance. This way, you waste less time commuting. It can try to shorten your school days. It can ensure that you get a lunch break within a large timeframe, possibly at slightly different times across weekdays. It can prioritize instructors you like, putting schedules with them closer to the top. Finally, it combines all these factors using weights you specify to calculate a ""composite preference score"" for each schedule. The top-left histogram shows the overall distribution of these scores across the 40,000+ schedules and shows that Schedule 1 is the best in this metric.. 4. Nuanced preference replication, also worth highlighting. People have different kinds of preferences when it comes to earliest class time---some like them to be exactly 9am, some like them as early as possible, some like them as late as possible. Whatever your kind of preference, the optimizer rates each schedule according to it with a score. The second histogram shows the distribution of these scores across the 40,000+ schedules. It tells you that the best composite-scoring schedule has one of the best ratings for earliest class times, but not the absolute best.. 5. The scatterplot gives you a broad overview of weekly travel distance (in meters) versus composite preference score. The current schedule is highlighted in pure black. It has the highest composite preference score, but you can choose to sacrifice a bit of that earliest-latest class preference for less distance to travel, as shown by the translucent dots to the bottom-left of the black dot. Scatterplots tell you what tradeoffs are possible between the x and y metrics.. .

But when you get the check it's for more than you expected, and then they send you an email saying they made an error, but because everyone's in a hurry could you please just deposit the check and mail a personal check for the difference? The check itself looks really authentic (it's on heavy paper, with a nice company logo and signature), but it's a fake.

Renters get screwed in Ann Arbor because they have limited choices in where to live, especially if they aren't looking nearly a year in advance.

Judicial is the smallest. It's the Central Student Judiciary. I think members are nominated by the CSG President, and confirmed by the CSG Assembly. They almost never get called. Sometimes, they get involved in election cases, if an appeal is made to a decision from the Election Commission.. . . . Legislative is the bicameral, with a strong ""lower house"" and weak ""upper house"". The strong ""lower house"" is the CSG Assembly, made up up elected representatives from each school and college, and I think some special elected representatives like for International Students now as well maybe? Not sure. The number of reps per school/college is dependent on its size. The Assembly has a Speaker and Vice Speaker. The speaker does not technically need to be a elected representative, but they basically always are. The speaker is elected by popular vote of the Assembly. The Assembly also has committees, led by Chairs (membership of each committee is made up of those Reps). The weak ""upper house"" is the University Council. It is made up of the Presidents of each of the smaller student governments across Michigan (LSA Student Government, Rackham Student Government, Residence Halls Association, etc.). It is chaired by the University Council President, who is the Vice President of Central Student Government.. . . . The Executive is led by the President. The President works with the Vice President, and an Executive Committee made up of officers - and that is typically led by the Chief of Staff. The other officers typically include Treasurer, General Counsel, Senior Policy Advisors, Communications Director, and sometimes others. There are also Executive Commissions. These are typically within the portfolio of one of the officers mentioned above, and are chaired by a Commission Chair. The most notable commission is probably SOFC, which funds student orgs. They are chaired by the SOFC Chair, who reports to the Treasurer of CSG. The Executive Officers also often have interns. There are also paid staff, like administrative staff and CSG Airbus staff. There is also a full-time SSO Advisor, but they aren't part of the Executive Branch, or really any branch (they are a representative from the University).. . . . Task forces are typically temporary commissions established by Executive Order of the President, but I think they can also sometimes be ad hoc committees made by the Assembly or University Council.. . . .

t1_ibsrvc1,2022-06-10 00:38:33,t3_v5rn4l,t3_v5rn4l,"Hi! First, welcome to UofM! I work with Newnan and am one of the people who helps new students register for classes during orientation, so I hope I can help ease some concerns as well as provide some helpful info.. . . . 1. First, I echo everything that has already been said. In general, my advice would be to *not* build schedules in advance. It is good practice to peruse the course guide and have ideas/options in mind or written down/stored somewhere, but it is often not productive to build schedules with specific sections/times until about 24 hours (or even less...) before your registration appointment. Unless you have a very early registration appointment (such as when you're a senior), you'd be surprised at how much course availability can change even within an hour. That being said, you're already in a great place and will be WAY more prepared than the majority of incoming students, so orientation will be a breeze and not very stressful for you. This is good, you're doing great already :). 2. On June 13th when you have your advising date, here is what to expect: this year, LSA students will have their orientation/advising done in *groups*. You will join a Zoom with about \~20 other students. The first hour will be a presentation done by the advisors (you will likely already be ahead of a lot of this information, as most students come in with little knowledge so this portion is necessary), but be sure to still pay attention because there are some details that will likely be new to you. **Make sure you are not late to the start date of your orientation.** If you join past a certain point, **ONSP will pull your registration appointment** meaning you will not be able to register for courses and will be bumped to a make-up date later in the summer. After the presentation, you'll go into a breakout room with the advisors who will help you build your schedule/answer questions. If you're on Monday the 13th, then your actual registration appointment will open exactly at 2:30PM (if your session starts at 1). Again, do not be late and make sure you show up at one. You'll have to hang tight for a bit before you can actually register, so patience is key :). 3. As mentioned in other responses, you should be fine about course availability. Here's some more specific details:. . * For your general chemistry sequence (130/125/126), there are still PLENTY of open seats and it won't fill by the time you register. You might have to pick a different time, but there's still lots of options.. * For Math 116, it will look like there's few seats open. The Math department is unique in that they only display a small number of seats at a time, wait for them all to fill up, and then release more throughout the summer. This is just the way they decide to do things, and it helps them meet course demand as well as balance registration across offered sections (making sure students who want to take the class take the class rather than everybody waitlisting for the best section times while ""bad"" or ""not ideal"" class times remain open. There may or may not be a lot of options on Monday when you register, it's hard to tell. With that being said, **once your registration appointment opens it stays open**, meaning you can make changes to your schedule throughout the summer and even into the first couple weeks of classes up to the add/drop deadline. If you really want a different Calc II section, just check on the course guide periodically throughout the summer to see when more classes open up. I would recommend checking in the mornings before like 10AM. You can use the ""Swap"" feature in Wolverine Access to switch into a different section if needed.. * PHIL 183 doesn't have a ton of open seats, but the seats that are open are mostly under Enrollment Restrictions for first year students. I am posting this the evening on 6/9/22 (Thursday). Between now and when you register on Monday, there will be about \~80 new students who register before you. In my experiences with this job, it's very unlikely this class will fill by the time you register on Monday.. * EECS 280: This class likely won't fill by the time you register, but there are some other issues that may or may not apply to you (more on this below). I encourage you to read through my points there before your session on Monday!. . Additionally, there's a few things I wanted to point out to you based on the screenshot of Schedule Builder you shared. In general, Atlas Schedule Builder is a *fantastic* tool *when used properly*. As simple and user friendly as it is, it has a lot of negative side effects students overlook which comes to bite them when registering. Since it was released a little while back, there's already been some great improvements (such as being able to remove courses as options that are closed in the Settings button, which believe it or not didn't used to be there, LOL), but there's still a long way to go.. . Notably, Schedule Builder **does not check for enrollment restrictions**. What does this mean? It means it does not account for things like OPEN RESTRICTED SEATS nor pre-requisites. When using Schedule Builder, it is extremely important to **always cross-reference the sections/courses you have in your schedule with the same course section in the LSA Course Guide or Wolverine Access**. On the LSA Course Guide, there is a column under ""Schedule"" next to the number of open seats. This might be for student groups, Honors, Enrollment Management, etc.... . In the case of your specific schedule, I want to emphasize some *potential* issues with EECS 280. You may already know this, but just in case! First, the EECS 280 lab you have in your sample schedule screenshot (LAB Section 21) has an enrollment restriction: all the seats are reserved for students in CSP (the Comprehensive Studies Program). If you're in CSP, great - feel free to ignore this. If you aren't in CSP or are wondering what that is, **it means you cannot take this specific lab section of EECS 280.** You won't be able to register for it. As of my posting this, there's still like 6 open sections of labs without enrollment restrictions you could register for.. . Second, **EECS 280 has Enforced Prerequisites** of the following: ENGR 101 or 151 or EECS 180 or 183 or ROB 102;(C or better, No OP/F). And fewer than 2 previous elections of EECS 280 (incl. grades of W & I). Enforced prerequisites mean you *cannot* register for the class without those prerequisites being *listed on your transcript*. If you already meet the pre-requisites and they are displayed on your transcript, fantastic - you're good to go. If not, here's some more info. If you are an incoming new student, I am assuming you do not have credit for EECS 180/183 nor ENGR 101/151. You may have transfer credit, you may have incoming AP/IB credit or something. **Unless the transfer credit for these pre-requisites are physically listed on your transcript** (meaning they've already been sent over, processed, and posted by the University) **you cannot register for EECS 280**. The EECS program is very specific (and unlike other departments on campus) in that they will NOT issue overrides until the credit is posted, literally (to my knowledge) no exceptions. Just something to consider.. . With that being said, you can request to start in EECS 280 if you don't have the required enforced pre-requisites, but you can ONLY do so after you attend orientation. You can read more about this [here](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/for-current-students/advising/enrollment/), and on the previous link you can access [this form to request permission](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOSfAH--5G5CrHp7X1GpLcwjYaWtDC2lFx7nFVRZla5GC77g/viewform). As part of this process, you need to complete a [diagnostic project](https://eecs280staff.github.io/diagnostic/) and receive a score of at least 50, and then you must wait (about 10-14 days) for your request to be approved/denied. It is not guaranteed to be approved. Either way, if the aforementioned applies to you, I'd recommend finding an alternative course for EECS 280 for the time being so you can have something in your schedule until you find out if you can or cannot register for EECS 280.. . Lastly, there is one tiny hiccup with your general chemistry courses. When registering for general chemistry, **Chem 125 and Chem 126 must match**. In your screenshot, you are registered for Section 100 of Chem 125, but Section 300 of Chem 126. Make sure you switch the Chem 126 (300) to Chem 126 (100) and you'll be good to go!. .

For example, English 125 is a course type that has tons of sections each semester students can choose from.. . In this case for Chem 130/125/126, the sections for Chem 125 and Chem 126 have to match based on how the course is organized and structured in Wolverine Access by the chemistry department.. . For all types of courses, the sections themselves don't really carry any meaning. For example, a course like Psych 111 might have four lecture sections offered each semester. Each section is often at a different day/time and may be taught be different instructors. Departments/programs code their courses differently, so there's no uniform way sections are numbered. For example, a class like Chem 130 might have lecture sections 100, 200, 300, and 400. There's no difference in content or difficulty between them, another way to think about it would be Option A, Option B, Option C, etc... The exception would be some courses have specific sections that differ from the rest. For example, one course might have a lecture section designed for students only in a program like CSP (Comprehensive Studies Program). For example, Psych 111 in the fall often had a lecture Section with a different format (in that there's no discussion component) designed for nursing students. With physics, some sections may differ in the way they teach physics, such as the studio versions of the course (more collaborative learning approach) vs the traditional lecture format (more independent learning). These exceptions are most always noted in the course guide under the ""Note"" in the Schedule portion or in the description. Hope this helps!",1.0,neutral,0.8687146306037903

There will be an article response instead of a quiz on 2 weeks of the semester, and those take like an hour or 2 to do. 3 exams per semester, but no final exam since last exam isn't cumulative.

Get outside of your comfort zone little by little if that's the issue! . . 3) Share your interests regularly (video games, tv shows, projects, etc) . . 4) Reflect deeply about what may be the issue, but dont beat yourself up for it.

FWIW, my first job title was ""Industrial Engineer."" I wasn't in the majority, but it was possible to find if you wanted to. I chose that job (internal process improvement consulting as an industrial engineer) because I didn't feel ready to pick one part of my degree to use in a field like supply chain, consulting, etc. . . That being said, plenty of the folks I knew who went into something more specialized didn't know that they wanted to do that thing before they took their first IOE class. They figured it out along the way based on their favorite and least favorite classes, as well as internships. . . > What is IOE in simple terms? . . When people think of an engineer, they think of someone who builds or creates things. IOEs usually don't build new things. We use a set of problem solving skills to optimize processes, products, strategies, etc. . . This video doesn't cover every single application of IE, but I remember liking it when I was a freshman trying to choose an engineering major to pursue: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=krCjsxDhNyM. . If you haven't already, check out the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers website. That's the professional organization for the field. . . > What are largest subject components (like math, business, physics?)? . . Almost zero physics - you have to take the classes because ABET (national accrediting body) requires that for all ABET-accredited engineering degrees. If you love physics, you could probably find applications of it in ergonomics and human factors - which are part of IOE. . . It's a lot of applied math (not super theoretical calculus - I liked the major despite hating the pure math classes I took after Math 116) and business concepts. Also a good chunk of statistics, which is way more useful in the workplace than pure math. . . > What type of thinking should one be good at to excel in IOE? . . I think IOE teaches you to be a better critical thinker and problem solver. I'm not sure you need a specific style but it helps to be curious and open minded. . . > What type of personality is most suitable for the major?. . Again, I think it's helpful to be curious and to like problem solving. Do you see inefficient processes (e.g., a long line at Chipotle) in the world and think of ways it could be better? That could be a good sign for enjoying IOE - but if you haven't experienced that, it doesn't mean it would be a bad fit. . . IOE is a (relatively) big department and I feel like there was a large variety in personalities and communication styles. *Maybe* it skewed a bit more extraverted than other CoE majors, but that could be explained by other demographic factors (e.g., more women, fewer international students, etc.). . .

t1_icxiksd,2022-06-19 10:31:48,t3_vfr79r,t3_vfr79r,"I have some place of comparison for you: I did a CS major as an undergrad at University of Michigan and my partner did a CS minor at Harvard. I don't have tons of personal experience with Harvard's CS program, but my partner and I were both CS TAs and I spent half a term at Harvard's engineering campus (where many of your CS classes would be held).. . My major complaints about Michigan's CS program include class size and the organization of the program itself. I feel like the weeder classes are punitive in large part due to the class size and that the class size makes your success dependent on a bizarre mix of strategy (going to office hours when no one else is there because you start your project as soon as it is assigned) and dumb luck (better not have any last minute bugs because you'll wait three hours in one of your first CS classes to get 5-10 minutes of time with a TA) that fail to demonstrate skill. When I joked about the office hours to my partner, he gave me an incredibly blank look because apparently this is not a real concern at Harvard, a small college. Michigan also requires some self-guided learning as a general policy in their ""higher level"" courses, which I disagree with - if I could learn it at home, what am I paying you for? This led to many confused students at office hours.. . Harvard and Michigan both share the issue of CS being a bit off-campus. Harvard Yard and most of the older houses are at Harvard Square in Cambridge. CS classes often take place at the new engineering campus in Allston across the bridge, so you'll need to take a 15 minute shuttle. (If you end up in the quad, you'll have a 25-30 minute ride.) Harvard houses are like Harry Potter houses; you get sorted in sophomore year and stay in there until you graduate (over 90-some percent of students live in campus housing for all four years!), so your commute time isn't getting any shorter. (Though the freshman dorms are in Harvard Yard, so you'll get that short commute time.) Michigan will have you taking the campus bus up to North Campus (engineering, art, architecture, music, performing arts). It's about 15-20 minutes from central campus, where most other student activities are. Typically, students don't live on campus after freshman or sophomore year, so you can live as close or far from the campus as you want.. . In re: the Harvard ""name"": my partner believes in the Harvard name, but his non-CS major also has him going into academia, not industry. I personally have interned at pretty good (not FAANG but known) companies, and I have never actually met anyone from Harvard there. I've met several folks from Michigan and definitely more from MIT or UIUC or Berkeley or Cornell than Harvard (sorry, big H). . . Other important differences to consider: are you in the College of Engineering at Michigan? I was, and it meant that we don't have to take English classes or most of the other requirements that liberal arts colleges like Harvard would have you do to get a ""well-rounded"" education. (In the College of Engineering, you could still opt to do them as electives or intellectual breadth, but it's not required for the most part!) What do you value most? You can always switch to LSA (liberal arts college at Michigan), but you probably might as well go to Harvard if you want a liberal arts experience in particular, since that's their specialty. At Michigan, you can also transfer to College of Engineering from LSA, but you have to be very careful about keeping your grades up at the beginning.. . tl;dr Michigan suffers from Big School problems (too many students, not enough funding for more faculty and staff) and a disorganized program. Harvard's ""rep"" doesn't seem to be as much of a name brand in SWE and Michigan has more name recognition. Harvard is inherently a liberal arts program, while Michigan doesn't have to be. Harvard engineering campus might potentially be farther away.. . Feel free to DM me if you have more questions.

However, I do think the students at Harvard, *on average*, are more academically oriented and higher achieving than at U-M.

In the CoE, the demographics of the graduate students tends to be 80%+ international students.

The VA certifying officials (I used to work as an assistant to them) at the university are the ones who actually understand your benefits, Phil just knows generalities and will most often miss many important things and not connect you with some more benefits/opportunities that you may qualify for. Speak with them and not Phil.. . I would also reach out to Dr. Eric Fretz (ebfretz@umich.edu), hes faculty at the university and does 10x what Phil does for veterans on campus.

CHEM 130: keep up with the chapters! Always be a chapter ahead, start early if you can! I think you can access the book online before the class starts. I'd recommend doing that, and being 1-2 chapters ahead (the 1st chapter is covered in a day or two since it's very basic). Additionally, I would say to rely more on the textbook than the lecture material (always go to lecture, but study from the textbook). Do all of the suggested textbook problems & make sure you understand why they should be solved a certain way. I got a 100% on the first couple exams and ended up with an A+ in the class. And I truly did not stretch myself out too thin to do so. I hope that provides some insight. . *I took it with Castaneda, but I've heard great things about Bartlett too! Check the ratings on ""atlas.umich.edu"" for all your courses and professors. . . CHEM 125/126: Just a ton of a busywork. You can get lucky based off of your GSI, but some grade for accuracy whereas others grade for effort/completion. Just be willing to put in the time. It's not very difficult content wise. . . MATH 115: it's not that bad. Do NOT let people psych you out. It's only ""notoriously hard"" because a whole lot of majors require Calc 1, and many take it their first semester freshman year where they are transitioning to college level classes in general. It's truly not that bad, especially if you took pre-Calc in high school (I didn't even take pre-Calc in high school, and I was just fine). You are just learning new math, just as you did in high school. And a lot of it is very intuitive imo. I totally regret letting people get to my head, I was so anxious/worried for no reason! It definitely requires work--go to office hours in the math lab and get close with your GSI! Don't be shy to email the instructor or ask questions in class whenever needed. Try to understand the material before you leave class, and try to understand every homework question-- a couple similar ones might show up on the exam. Additionally, look up ""umich exam shop"" to find old exams to study from. Chances are, you will come across very similar problems on the exams you take. Best of luck, you got this!. *Try to take a CSP section if you can. Paul Horvath is amazing with students, but all CSP sections have great things to be said about them. (Scroll to the bottom of the available classes and make sure your search includes full classes as well. Usually you can waitlist a class and ask for an override in the beginning of the semester. I wouldn't bet on it if there's more than 3-5 people on the waitlist over the class capacity).. . ENGR 101: Choose your partner wisely, or do not choose one at all, or maybe even hold off for the first couple projects until you find a reliable person. Having a partner is great to work with but you need to make sure they're trustworthy. I know many students who received an honor code violation that caused them to fail the course. Sometimes they cheated or their partner did. On that note, do not cheat or even think about it, these are PhD professors who have coded their own system to detect cheating (and they are literally coding experts). Go to office hours, the GSIs are super helpful! The class is really shaped for your enrichment, please take full advantage. Learning to code is super fun and the first half of the semester is honestly the perfect pace for a new coder! I went in with zero coding knowledge and still managed an A!. *Lectures are recorded for the class which is really convenient esp because it's on North Campus. Only one lecture is required per week, and the other is optional. . . Now I took these with ECON 101, which made it a little bit intense. If it's your first semester, I'd definitely recommend taking a lighter 4th class (like SPANISH 277 it seems like) to make sure you adjust well. Perhaps look into a minor that you could start taking pre-reqs to? Maybe some intro class? Or you could take advantage of your first-year seminar. Or take your 300-level humanities requirement. . .

I do have close friends that applied through the external transfer track and it certainly is competitive. I would reach out to several Ross students and ask to see their essays or have them look over yours. If you really want in, have like 25 people look over your essays (this could be Ross students, English teacher(s), academic peers, counselors, etc) in order to really refine them.. Remember that a lot of people hire college coaches to assist in their applications, and these coaches are trained to know exactly what Ross is looking for. To have a good chance, you have to become an expert. Research the BBA program, show demonstrated interest (contact admissions office, ask for appointments, attend virtual Ross events, be an active follower on their social media page, etc), and create your application around a concentration that best fits your experiences/coursework. (You can change your concentration at any time, so if you wanna go into Finance but you have taken marketing courses, have acquired marketing-related skills, and have a marketing internship, then apply with a focus in marketing to be able to connect your experiences with what you want to do and how Ross can help you. You need show you are taking initiative towards your goals). College coaches call this a ""spike""--having a heavy concentration of experiences in the area you are applying under rather than attempting to come off as well-rounded. . Additionally, you have to highlight what Ross offers that your current institution does not. Why MUST Ross be the only way you can continue your career the way you want? Is there a specific course?

I was so afraid that it was gonna get infected or not done right, so I researched a lot of places in A2 and Gamma is like extra certified or something, I think with the American Piercer Association or something. . . Anyways they did an amazing job. The piercer made sure I knew what was going on at all times and checked in multiple times before she actually pierced my ears. I love my piercings, although the only con is that it was quite expensive, coming in at about $300 total I think. However, to me it was worth it because all of their piercers are super trained and also they only use like gold and silver jewelry (basically non-allergenic metal I think). also they make sure you know exactly what to do for aftercare and give you a saline spray. Also, a jewelry change is included in that price (after a few weeks, they give you a different backing set that's shorter/better for healed piercings).. . As for the pain, it was about 5 seconds of a pinching feeling but quickly faded and I didn't really notice the feeling at all after a few hours. I would say go for it!

First impressions matter a lot and campus tours can really have an outsized impact on potential students, giving them an opportunity to not just see and hear about campus but about stoking their imagination for the opportunities and communities they can soon belong to. Similar to how real estate tours are always through mostly-empty houses so that clients can imagine their own furniture in the space, there's a reason campus tour guides are almost always current undergraduates: prospective students have to be able to imagine themselves as that person. Grad school is, unfortunately, one step too far for a typical high school student to have in their field of vision.. . Obviously you have good intentions, but it can be hard for prospective students to separate the hype and marketing from the reality within their own mind, and so the risk is that you leave your younger relative with an impression like ""UM is a boring state school where nothing interesting is happening"". Especially if they visit other campuses, by winging it yourself, you'll be implicitly competing against their (presumably more-practiced) tour guides.. . I would suggest waiting until September when campus will be more vibrant and (I would assume) tours will be available through the school.

I would strongly suggest thinking about why you want to pursue a dual degree and think about the trade-offs you will face. 18 credit semesters are hard (not just for CS, for most fields) and do not leave a lot time for building connections through clubs or other social activities (which scrolling through OP's replies seems to be why they want to pursue a dual degree).

""Huh was born in California while his parents were completing graduate school, but grew up in South Korea, where his family returned when he was approximately two years old. His mother and father taught Russian language and literature, and statistics respectively.[1][7] Poor scores on elementary school tests convinced him that he was not very good at math. He dropped out of high school to focus on writing poetry after becoming bored and exhausted by the routine of studying.[7] Because of this, he has been described as a late bloomer.[8] Huh commenced at Seoul National University (SNU) in 2002, but was initially unsettled. He initially aimed to become a science journalist and decided to major in astronomy and physics, but he had a poor attendance record and had to repeat several courses that he failed.[7]. Early in his studies he was mentored by Fields medalist mathematician Heisuke Hironaka, who went to SNU as a visiting professor.[9] Having failed several courses, Huh took an algebraic geometry course under Hironaka in his sixth year; Huh credited the course, which focused on singularity theory and was based on Hironaka's current research rather than established teaching material, for sparking his interest in research-level maths.[7] Huh then proceeded to complete a MS at SNU, while frequently travelling to Japan with Hironaka and acting as his personal assistant.[7] Due to his poor undergraduate record, Huh was rejected from all but one of the US universities that he applied to. He started his Ph.D. studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2009, before transferring in 2011 to the University of Michigan,[7] graduating in 2014 with a thesis written under the direction of Mircea Mustata.[10]"". .

t1_iezyvqi,2022-07-05 22:06:28,t1_ierlh2e,t3_v9v1t0,"Hi! I'm going into my sophomore year (academic standing junior) and I was a neuroscience major my freshman year. I took Bio 173 and Organic 210/211 of the classes you're taking this upcoming semester. . . Bio 173 is a joke, and as long as you show up and do the pre-lab questions you will pass. There are a total of 2 midterms that are open note and take up the time of the lab, so 3 hours, and besides that, maybe 3 ""major projects"" that take about an hour to complete. As long as you show up to class and do the assignments at minimum effort you will get an A. Also become friends with your GSI. It will help both in class and for making connections. . . Organic at U of M is no joke and honestly I probably would not have done as well if I had not taken it my senior year of high school. You are going to hear this from everyone but do not slack off. As long as you maintain diligence in studying and review at least 2-3 times a week you will be fine. In my opinion, the lectures were a lot less important than following the textbook they give you word for word- and memorize the problems they give you. They may reuse them. There are only 4 exams and that makes up your grade, but you only need 45% of the points to pass. If you need help go to office hours. And attend your discussion section. Even if it gets hard or youre depressed, you will thank yourself later. Some parts of exams will completely throw you for a loop but its orgo at u of m so its to be expected. Do not beat yourself up for not knowing *everything*. As long as you know at least 45% of the content for every exam you will do well over the average in the long run. . . For organic lab, you need to be thorough in your lab reports. Get to know your GSI and their expectations for the class so that you know exactly how to get an A. My GSI was worthless and actually got replaced, but the replacement was super lenient and as long as I followed a rubric I was getting 25/25 on each lab. However, my friend's GSI said there was absolutely no way anyone could get an A in her class and *no one did* because that's how she ran it. (he appealed later and did get an A but I'm just warning you some of these GSIS are miserable). It's unlikely you will get a GSI like that, but regardless, get to know them well and their grading style, what they look for, etc. Chem 211 has 2 midterms that are honestly kind of hard, but count the same or even less than the amount a lab report would, so don't sweat them. i got like 35% on both and still got an A because of my lab reports. Finally actually attend lecture because the professor tells you how to set up the lab/do it/your lab notebook so it's actually useful. . . . . I did not take the other two classes you are taking but if you took a heavy load of APs in highschool and know how to manage your time you will be alright. I took those 3 classes, first year japanese, and a health care class and managed to get all A's (B in 210). If you need any other advice feel free to ask!\~",2.0,error,0.0

(Not sure where the bigger ones are these days...The Union and Angell Hall?)

Play a couple games at Pinball Pete's on South U. You could grab a slice from Joe's Pizza at South U & East U, or sit down for a meal at the Brown Jug on South U. Head to the diag, pointing out the UGLi and Grad libraries. Check out the Michigan Union, spin the cube by the adjacent plaza. Walk through the law quad and point out the subterranean library (you can see it well enough from the outside...read up on it beforehand so you sound informed ;-), and consider a bite to eat at Dominick's next to there. Head up to Liberty & State, and walk down Liberty, popping in any stores that interest them. Maybe walk toward downtown for a nice dinner from a type of cuisine they might not be familiar with (e.g. Korean, Indian, Ethiopian). If they're here July 20 or Aug 17, check out a food truck rally at the Farmer's Market, or if they're here on a Saturday or Wednesday and it's nice, walk through the Farmer's Market and grab a sandwich to eat outside at Zingerman's. If they're vegetarian/vegan, there are some other threads with good recommendations, and maybe walk through the People's Food Co-op on 4th Ave. If the summer festival/Top of the Park is still in full swing, at least watch part of a movie there. There are plenty of niche stores downtown that might interest them, for comics, used books, fashion, games, M-emblazoned Michigan paraphernalia, etc. Plenty of museums too, like the Art Museum and Natural History Museum, on the off chance those are appealing.. . Walking by the undergrad dorms could be of some practical interest, like the Hill dorms, and North/South/East/West quads...they have different location advantages depending on what they're interested in, like someone who likes tennis or running on a track might prefer the Hill dorms, East Quad is home to the Residential College and attracts more eclectic types, North Quad is newer and is nearer the State/Liberty/downtown area, South Quad is closer to the athletic campus and attracts more student athletes.. . Riding Spin scooters might be a fun way to get around parts of campus, but you have to be 18 to use them legally, and I think they want both a driver's license and a credit card. . .

Maybe take them around North if they're interested in engineering. The BBB is always a great attraction, as is the Wilson Center if they have any interest in project teams.. . Off campus, there's a ton of great restaurants to take them to that I'm sure you know enough about.
