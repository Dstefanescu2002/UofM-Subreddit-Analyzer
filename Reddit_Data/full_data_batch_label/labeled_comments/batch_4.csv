In July/August of 1971 the crew of David Scott, Alfred Worden, and James Irwin traveled to the moon and back. Many of you in CoE, especially Aerospace, might know more about this mission but I didn't know much besides the fact that they all attended Michigan. . . Both Worden and Irwin earned their Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering from Michigan. From what I can tell Scott did not actually receive a degree from U-M. He attended Michigan for his freshman year, having been offered a swimming scholarship, and then transferred to West Point. . . The twelve day Apollo 15 mission was notable for several reasons. It was the first of a series of longer missions organized by NASA, nearly 4 days longer than Apollo 11. Scott and Irwin were the first landing team to use the lunar rover. You might have [watched this video in your high school physics class of David Scott dropping a hammer and feather on the moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDp1tiUsZw8). On the return to earth Worden performed the first spacewalk in deep space.. . Contrary to popular belief, [the crew did not plant a U-M flag on the moon](https://www.michigandaily.com/content/debunking-moon-myth. ). They did bring small U-M flags with them to have in the lunar module which were distributed on return (maybe some are in the FXB?). The crew [did establish a formal University of Michigan Club of The Moon, leaving a charter on the lunar surface.](https://www.facebook.com/michiganalumni/photos/46-years-ago-today-apollo-15s-u-m-alumni-crew-set-off-for-the-moon-where-they-le/10154544823461831/). . The crew also [brought several hundred stamped envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15_postal_covers_incident. ) with them on the mission. Some of these had been authorized by NASA but a few hundred extra that were not approved were also brought. The crew was reprimanded (none flew a NASA mission again) when NASA discovered that some were being sold and the astronauts had received a lump sum payment in exchange for them (they returned the money but it did not change NASA's penalty). . . Apollo 15 was not the only, or first, all-Wolverine NASA crew. James McDivitt and Ed White flew on Gemini 4 in 1965. The area between East and West Hall on central campus is named McDivitt-White Plaza in their honor. McDivitt later flew on Apollo 9 (along with David Scott). Ed White was the first American to perform a spacewalk, he died in 1967 during the Apollo 1 test fire.",21.0,error,0.0

The Apollo 15 postal covers incident, a 1972 NASA scandal, involved the astronauts of Apollo 15, who carried about 400 unauthorized postal covers into space and to the Moon's surface on the Lunar Module Falcon. Some of the envelopes were sold at high prices by West German stamp dealer Hermann Sieger, and are known as ""Sieger covers"". The crew of Apollo 15, David Scott, Alfred Worden and James Irwin, agreed to take payments for carrying the covers; though they returned the money, they were reprimanded by NASA. Amid much press coverage of the incident, the astronauts were called before a closed session of a Senate committee and never flew in space again.. .

The free printing isn't of great quality, as noted, but it's generally fine for prototyping and functional but not necessarily aesthetically pleasing parts. They also only have white PLA. The machines have been slowly dying for a long time, and were never high quality in the first place, so you get what you'd expect from a $600 printer designed several years ago by a company that has since shut down. That said, it's free, and sanding/filing can do a lot for surface quality.

t1_ev6r89v,2019-07-27 18:00:29,t3_ciiyql,t3_ciiyql,"I've been programming for 40+ years. I wasn't a big fan of OOP originally and even gave a talk in the late 1980s about its inherent weaknesses and how it wasn't going to solve all of our problems, but it did solve \*some\* of the problems we had back then. Back then the biggest problems were hard to understand spaghetti code that jumped from place to place, overuse of global variables, and the lack of code reusability. . . OOP didn't solve those problems, but good OOP languages and frameworks did mitigate them. For example, Objective-C on iOS is a pretty-good combination of language and framework. I can reuse about half of our code in multiple iOS and Mac projects just by including the source files or frameworks. This makes apps more reliable and less expensive to create. . . When I started using C, it didn't even have function prototypes. You could pass too many, too few, or the wrong types of parameters to a function and it would compile and link just fine, crashing at runtime. Pascal had better warnings, but was hard to use for stand-alone 'real world' microcomputer apps. Multithreading didn't exist, except via hardware interrupts and assembly language, although multiprocessing via fork() did exist. . . The author of that article names one goal of programming - reliability. That's ONE GOAL but by no means the only one. A more complete set of goals should be:. . 1. Correctness/reliability . 2. Speed (both single and multi-threaded). 3. Easy to write (low development cost). 4. Easy to understand (try inheriting a million line codebase). 5. Easy to modify/update. 6. Easy to test/prove. 7. Ability to re-use existing code in multiple projects (the holy grail). 8. Ease of learning and fun or at least not annoying to work in (not APL). . Functional programming by itself is good for processing data with simple well-defined inputs and outputs, but often they ""cheat"" by calling stateful databases to store the actual data. Those databases more often than not are written in C or C++, decidedly non-functional languages. The operating systems they run on are also written in C or C++, perhaps showing that functional programming is good for some things but not everything. . . The ability of a phone system to run reliably for years is great, but remember that a phone system is inherently a simple set of operations. Compare that to a modern multiuser game with AI and 3D engines and hundreds of moving sprites at all times. It's like comparing a command-line text editor like edlin to a multi-windowed word processing program like Word. . . Are there good lessons from functional languages? Absolutely! Non-mutable state is inherently more reliable than mutable state, so use it when possible. . . Are there good lessons from OOP languages? Yes! Putting a single feature into one tangible object or module makes it easy to understand, update, and reuse that object. . . And don't forget the shift to Generic Programming - the ability to write algorithms that safely operate on many different specific types of data. . . Programming paradigms are like religion to some people. They only believe in one and think it answers all of the questions in the universe, even as additional information comes along to show the opposite. The lack of security in languages is a big issue right now, so there's a move to make newer languages more secure. For example, in Swift a simple numeric overflow will terminate your application. The developers (rightly or wrongly) feel that crashing is better than being hacked or producing incorrect results. Hopefully future languages will crash less while still being secure, but someone has to invent them first.",17.0,error,0.0

Furthermore, all that is only for application-centric software development. There is so much non-application centric code out there too.

IMO your benefit from UROP really depends on what you want to do. Can you tell me more about your work history and career goals?. .

Sometimes that's the professors, but often this info is handled by grad students and it's a little bit unclear who the professor at the head of the lab is. . 2. Generally taking on Urop students is somewhat regarded as ""charity""/a good deed. The students are young and, while enthusiastic, somewhat unskilled. There's the added risk that, since many are trying out research for the first time, some will be very motivated/ambitious, and others will discover through the program that research isn't for them, and they'll be a bit apathetic. The labs do receive funding for each Urop student they take on, however. So if the lab you're interested in is smaller or less well funded, they may be more enthusiastic about the idea.

I've had urop students, paid students, and volunteers, as well as students taking independent study courses. Here are my tips:. . 1. Every lab/discipline is different. I'm a computer scientist. YMMV. 2. Be up front about interest in being paid. No need to hide it. You can always say your preference is for paid internships but you would be willing to consider academic credit or volunteering depending upon the opportunity.. 3. Think about this like employment - what do you have that I want? Things I like to hear:. - skillsets that I need, like programming. - passion and an interest to really explore deeply an area. - a desire to explore research with the eye that maybe you'll be interested in a grad degree. - dedication to a single lab in a semester. Eg you aren't going to try and join a whole bunch of things and do them all half assed. Things I don't like to hear:. - that you can learn a lot from me. I hear this quite a bit and while I'm sure it's meant to be complementary it's a turn off. I need people who can help me be productive (papers, experiments, analyses, etc). I have lots of teaching duties already.. 4. Volunteering isn't much of a bonus to me, if I have the money. My biggest challenge is my time, but this will depend highly on department and project.. 5. Being a junior is in your favor. Freshman/sophomore from urop are often quite limited in what they can do. Consider finding ways to differentiate yourself from them.. 6. Right now is *the time* to be hitting up faculty. Always include a full CV with your email and tell them what excited you about their lab. Top attribute is passion for me.. 7.

When the building was designed there had originally been plans for a swimming pool but construction on that was delayed due to lack of funds. . . The building officially opened in 1919 and the swimming pool was added in 1925. From looking over blueprints for the building (found via the [Bentley Historical Library Image Bank](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhl?page=index)) it seems like this pool was on the south side of the building, sort of where the Barnes and Noble was in the basement.

Take as many classes as possible at a CC (usually over the summer), or online (At least in engineering you can take 12 credits online). I'd check out the transfer credit database, and recommend you do as much calculus, intro science, and breadth requirements there as possible. I'd recommend against doing 203/280, etc at a CC because it'll hurt you later. This also is good for your GPA, because most of the classes you can take at a CC/online are the weeder classes that kill your GPA, while grades never transfer, only credits do (the classes there are also usually easier). . . 2. It's better to take out a loan, than it is to work, if it means you can graduate earlier. Basically this requires a bit of long term planning, but if you're here for 6 semesters, and working costs you 2-3 credits a semester (10 hours a week at work, at 2-3 times the number of hours on a credit, which is what the advising office recommends), that's an extra semester you'd have to stay if you worked. And if you can start a CS job 4 months earlier, you'll earn WAY more than you would working, and should be able to pay down the loans.. . This is what I did, and it seems to be working out (I'm graduating in december), although this may not be work out for everybody (this is not financial advise/don't sue me lol), and I also did work a little bit during the year, but that was for my resume.

I guess parts of North Campus can be pretty at times, but from the streets, campus looks relatively plain in general. The law quad is arguably the prettiest part of campus, but the outer perimeter of buildings seclude the inner courtyard, and the outward facing architecture is blocked off by a fair bit of tree leaves (especially this time of year) if you're viewing it from the street. . 3) while there are some cool buildings with funky architecture you can see from a car, I don't know how much you'll get out of the experience if you're in a moving vehicle and trying to keep your eyes on the road. . .

I'm not sure about your case but here are some anecdotes that will give you an idea of how they handle these cases.. . 1. My brother lived in Michigan for his entire life. He then went to school out of state in Indiana (paying out of state tuition). One summer he came home and wanted to take classes at UofM Flint. They denied his residency and tried to make him pay out of state tuition. After a lengthy battle they eventually caved and gave him in state tuition.. 2. I originally came to UofM in 2008-2009 and flunked out. I left school and joined the Navy for 6 years. When I left the Navy, I came back to Michigan on the GI Bill. It is a law that all state schools charge in state tuition to vets on the GI Bill. However, I think they just resumed any administrative paper work from my previous time here which meant that I kept the in state tuition that I previously had. At some point during my first semester back, someone in the residency office caught realized that I had lived out of state during my hiatus. They immediately removed my in state tuition and sent me a bill for like 30k. It took me about a week to get them to change it back to in state tuition.. 3. My girlfriend was born and raised in Ann Arbor and got her bachelors from Michigan in 2015 (in state tuition the whole time). She then left and went and worked in San Fransisco for like 14 months. After leaving her job there, she came back to UofM to take some classes before applying to med school. I can't remember the exact timeline of her case, but they made every effort to deny her in state tuition despite her being a Michigan resident for 96% of her life. I think eventually she got in state tuition but she might have had to pay one semester out of state prior to reestablishing residency.. . I'm not really sure how exactly they determine if a student gets in state tuition vs out of state tuition. However, these stories should make one point very clear. They will always default to out of state tuition if there is any indication that you have spent even one millisecond looking across the border at another state. However, my momma always used to say that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, so just keep fighting and hopefully you will win (20k/yr is a shit ton of money and worth a considerable amount of your time and energy).",2.0,error,0.0

This is because the ECE dept teaches in the fall and covers more theoretical ground while the CSE dept teaches in the winter and covers topics with a more applied flavor. Homework assignments in Fall '18 were mainly proofs and a tiny bit of implementing the algorithms/methods that we proved.. . The reason why it's recommended that you take an ML course before this one is mainly because of the mathematical rigor required in this course. Some people who have taken EECS 445 (the undergrad version of ML) prior to 545 still struggled, even though there is like 60% overlap in the topics covered. There is much less handholding in 545 than 445, and the homework assignments are much more theoretical (I don't remember even using sklearn for any assignments in 545, whereas in 445 you frequently use sklearn for some of the homework assignments to see the effects of tuning certain parameters in the different ML algorithms).. . If you're comfortable with the type of math covered in IOE (convex optimization) and matrix calculus you'll be fine. I walked in with decent background in linear algebra and matrix calculus, but still struggled because of convex optimization math.. . However, the idea of this course is an introduction to machine learning for graduate ECE/CSE students. If you want to study ML at a more advanced level, you can check out EECS 564 (Estimation, Filtering, and Detection). From what I've heard from friends who've taken both 564 and 545, 564 covers all the ML math you need at a more in-depth level and has more of an EE flavor to the topics covered. If you just want more ML exposure at the industry/research level, you can always join a research lab and tackle on an ML related research project instead (and I would recommend this over taking 545/564 if you already have an ML course under your belt).",3.0,neutral,0.8521345257759094

I didn't start til winter last year (sophomore year), but it's a huge help. Keeping a schedule will help you prioritize your time. I initially wrote schedules down for each day, but it was inefficient and more difficult to stick to. (Also keep track of assignments in a similar manner).. . 2. Plan your 4 (or 5) years at school in terms of classes. Look at the course guides. Explore different majors or minors through information pages. Talk to your advisor 3 times per semester. I've done this since the beginning and it's actually very satisfying. Keep track of degree planning in a spreadsheet. Most importantly, you aren't bound to whatever degree plan you set out for yourself, change it when you feel it's necessary or find an interesting new path for yourself. I came into school thinking I'd graduate in 4 years with a BBA and a minor in electrical engineering. That turned into dual degree of BBA and the Environment for a few weeks. Then I thought about minoring in Economics. Then Computer Science, and now, I'm going into junior year pretty much fully committed to a dual degree BBA and CS (LSA). And there's probably a few more things I was considering in between all that (by considering I mean planning out future courses and looking for interesting courses that would satisfy requirements).. . 3. Building off the last point: take classes you are interested in and don't underestimate yourself! These 4 (or 5) years are the best time to explore your areas of interest academically. If a class looks intimidating but something you hear is great and interests you, then take it and drop it if necessary. My primary example of this is EECS 183 (highly recommend!). I heard from the beginning at orientation that it was a great course, and I had a desire to learn programming (zero prior experience), yet I was intimidated and lacked confidence in my ability to perform in that kind of class. For 3 semesters I ignored the class until finally taking it last winter. It was the first or second most impactful ive taken thus far at Michigan. I ended up enjoying the class very much and didn't find it too difficult either. I enjoyed it so much that I stayed spring semester and took two more EECS courses (280 and 203), and now find myself committing to the full major.. . Extra: don't overextend yourself (too many clubs), go to office hours to get to know professors and do better in classes, and enjoy your life (try new things, it's the best time to do so).",11.0,error,0.0

This, combined with the fact that most 200+ level class IAs are transfers from other classes and not direct hires - like myself - means your best bet is to apply for 183.

Don't worry about your grades, your interview/video are much more important.. . If you're set on making money from the CS department, consider tutoring, either privately or through the department.

If you're consulting then it'll be Bond, Nexecon, 180 ( top 3 imo, but APEX and 180 could switch).. . If you're going finance. You'll need to network and make sure you can get a referall otherwise you'll need an incredible resume to get interview. This means go to all the events and talk to as many people as possible and try to fun to be around. If you make it to first round interviews, you'll need to have 3 stock pitches ready and know basic technicals. They'll grill you on your pitch so make sure you can back yourself up. Choose 3 stocks that aren't random penny stocks and don't choose super common ones either ( Amazon, Apple, FB, etc). There's also behaviorals so make sure focus on those as well. From there there is a second round which you'll need more pitches and be able to answer your finance technicals quite well. This is all from what I've heard btw (I went consulting). . Consulting is going to be different. While the initial process of either networking or having an incredible resume is the same, it changes for interviews. To give some more information, the cut-off my club used for GPA was 3.7 for sophomores. If they're a freshmen, we looked for several leadership positions, awards, and usually something that really sets the candidate apart. The majority of candidates are DECA nationalists or state finalists so that's essentially the bare minimum. We also do take into consideration your background and school district ( expect more from high income areas compared to low). The basic format for all the clubs is essentially market sizing and behavioral for first round and then a case for the second round. However, BOND and Nexecon are a bit different. BOND expects 4.0 students who are incredibly talented and I'm not too sure on what else they look for. Nexecon works the same as most other clubs, but referalls play a large part so networking is severely important. 180 considers referalls minimally and will only help if you're on the fence for an interview. Similarly, the cases for BOND and Nexecon are harder than the rest. Nexecon will give you a small case for the first round after market sizing and are only slightly easier than 180's and APEXs second round case. In the recent recruiting cycles, 180 has been placing heavily into finance as opposed to consulting so that is also important to consider. . . PM me if you need more info.",12.0,error,0.0

I also play violin, so it might be a little different given that you play bass clarinet . . In terms of auditioning, I'd say Pops and Campus Symphony Orchestra are pretty close in terms of how competitive positions are. I was last stand in CSO in the seconds my freshman year, and I was 3rd stand in the seconds for Pops when I did it my sophomore year. I'd say the talent level for both is pretty high. Campus Philharmonic Orchestra is also a campus orchestra and it's less competitive than CSO. You do a campus orchestra audition and then they'll place you in CSO, CPO, or nothing. For Campus orchestras, it's open to anyone affiliated with the University and not just students, so some of those spots are pretty much on lock. For example, I remember one of the clarinets being an older gentleman, maybe like 50, who was probably a professor, and I think hes been in CSO for awhile.. . Pops and Campus Orchestras are pretty different in terms of their schedule and what they play. I did CSO my freshman year; the practices were on Wednesday nights on North Campus, and that ended up being really difficult for me. One day in November you'll have 2 midterms on Thursday, and the last thing you'll want to do is catch a bus in freezing weather and lug your instrument to the music school. The repertoire was mostly regular stuff you'd expect from an orchestra - when I did it, we played Danzon no 2 one semester and a tchaik piece the other semester. We also did a solo and people within the orchestra auditioned for it. . . I didn't like having to bus up on a Wednesday and, this might just be me, but I thought the community in CSO was a little cold and I didn't make many friends there. I decided to not re-audition for CSO my sophomore year and decided to do Pops, since I heard that it was more laid back and the repertoire was more fun. . . Like I said, the audition process for Pops was similar to CSO's, and some people definitely did not make the cut. The biggest issue I had with Pops is that there's just too much music - we literally played like 15-20 pieces in a concert, which would take like 3 hours. Some of them were easier and some were harder, but no matter what, I just never felt like we had enough time to practice everything to the point where we did it well. For example, one concert we had we played Jupiter, and that was a trainwreck. Maybe I should've practiced more individually, but by the concert, a lot of people were still faking their runs and bowings weren't communicated well. Some pieces we literally just sight read in the first week and didnt touch until we played it at dress rehearsal. But the practices were on a Sunday, which fits most peoples' schedules better, and the community is really strong - if you're worried about making friends as a freshman, Pops gives you a really good avenue to meet other people who are really passionate about music. . . As a disclaimer, I thought Pops was fun and more relaxed, but still had this air of ""we have 20 pieces and 9 rehearsals to learn all of this music,"" which some people vibed with, some people didnt. CSO was much more like a ""traditional "" orchestra that I was used to growing up. I actually ended up not playing in either orchestra my senior year to focus on recruiting and other interests, so I might be exaggerating some of the negative aspects and giving due credit to the positive ones. . . . If you're hoping to play at a decently high level, then CSO and Pops are your best bet, and I would suggest putting in good effort in preparing for those auditions.",5.0,error,0.0

The 140 lab in particular doesn't require a lot of work.. . Personally, since I ended up majoring in something (computer science) that didn't require 210, I wished I had taken physics before chem, and then hopefully that I had ended up not taking 210 after realizing that I wanted to major in CS and thus didn't need it. I don't know why taking physics first isn't suggested more often by advisors. Anyway, I believe environmental engineering only requires one chem class (with AP chem counting), so if you decide to go with that over chemical engineering, you'd have taken 210 (or 130) for no reason, like I did. At the time, I didn't realize AP chem fulfilled the chemistry requirement, but I probably would have taken 210 anyway due to their recommendation. So, I recommend taking physics before chem, at least for people with AP calc credit.. . I think you can gauge how difficult you'll find 216 pretty well from your experience in 215.

I can be transparent about what we look for.. . 1) Calling out the 3 stock pitches rumor - almost always never happens in our interviews since we care more about depth, not breadth. More recently, we don't even ask applicants for a stock pitch, we ask you all to discuss an interesting investment (can be private too) or trends in an industry that could be a good space to explore for publicly traded companies since we recognize that not everyone comes to college knowing they want to work in finance. Some do, but we don't eliminate candidates by process of who has the most technicals right or who has the most number of stock pitches ready with a valuation model (most of which are poorly put together from my experiences of interviewing). A pitch in the sense of demonstrating an investor mindset is important but we do not need 3 by any means, know just one well. . . 2) The second round is not going to need another stock pitch. You get an investment case or go over the same pitch you had in your initial application depending on this year's interview plans so know your basic AP Econ/HS econ fundamentals like demand, supply, profit/loss, business decisions like how to spot if a company/industry is failing, etc. and general business thinking skills. Neither MII or GIC expects people to know how to build DCFs or walk us through one impeccably on day 1. It's our job to teach you that since you're an incoming freshman. . . 3) Don't be a tool and pretend like you know more than you do - sure, you bring in a pitch you found on SeekingAlpha or some other place. We will grill you if we think your technicals/resume/business knowledge doesn't add up for the pitch you put in front of us, but if you say it is a buy/short because it is valued at xyz multiple, back it up. Know why the multiple matters, know why you think it is undervalued or overvalued. It is really, really easy for seniors and upperclassmen to sniff out plagiarized pitches or any work that has not been put together by you, regardless of how stellar your resume is. Also don't come across as a ""hardo"" - fit really matters and genuinely nice, humble people are what both clubs look for regardless of how much you crushed it in your interviews. If you're cocky or try to come across as a know it all, unless you do know it all and can pale a senior with industry experience, sorry. . . Both clubs love potential interviewees who have a strong desire to learn and are willing to put in the time to be part of the community and are there for the love of investing (not to just be there to learn what's needed for banking). BBA Meet the Clubs is happening on 9/12 in Ross Winter Garden to learn more, there are all sorts of clubs.

t1_eyqdlsz,2019-09-01 11:53:33,t1_eypw0ux,t3_cy3rkg,"Since you asked for it, Proper fan etiquette for Michigan Stadium from an old crotchety alumnus: . . Arrive at the game on time. This means before team introductions and the band takes the field. If you don't, you're missing the best part.. . Our team deserves to be cheered by a full house when they run out of the tunnel. Ideally, you want to walk in behind the band when they depart Revelli Hall, about an hour before kickoff, but I won't push it.. . Bringing friends from another school to the game is cool. But don't sell your student ticket to an opposing student you don't know. Just don't do it. Nobody wants them in our section.. . Learn the words to the Victors.. . If you arrive after kickoff and someone else has claimed your seat, be cool. Don't make them move, and do NOT, under any circumstance, contact a stadium attendance usher for assistance. What are you, 12? Just suck it up and squeeze in like the rest of us.. . Cheer wildly for our band. Clap in time with the beat. If you get lost, watch their feet. Don't get ahead of the band when they play our fight song (There is usually some level of delay from the mics on the field to the speakers in the stands, watch the band members). Learn some rhythm.. . If you don't have said rhythm, don't bring a cowbell. Leave that to the professionals.. . The only response to ""GO!"" is ""BLUE!"" This should be self-explanatory. . . No wearing a jacket or coat over your Michigan stuff. If it's that cold, layer appropriately, but make sure your top layer says Michigan.. . Pump your fist every time the word ""HAIL"" is said during the Victors, as well as at any other point it's said that day. Between the first and second verses of the Victors, chant out ""LET'S GO BLUE"" and alternate pumping your fists with each word. Start with your left fist so you will be ready to fist pump for ""HAIL"" at the start of the second verse. So it goes like this: ""...the leaders and best, (pump left) LET'S; (pump right) GO; (pump left) BLUE!; (pump right) HAIL; to the victors valiant..."" Hard to explain in text, watch people for it. . . The official lyrics to the Varsity cheer are as follows:. . ""Varsity, varsity!. Varsity, oh, varsity!. Varsity oh varsity oh varsity!. var-sity-var-sity. Varsity, varsity!. Varsity, oh, varsity!. Varsity, oh, varsity. OH, VARSITY!"". . As our flag is raised by the tri-force ROTC colorguard, we invite you to stand and sing our national anthem. If you're not singing, shut the hell up. Seriously. And gentlemen, please remove your hats. Some people pump their fists at the line ""What so proudly we HAILED"" however please return to attention after that. . . Sitting is only permissible before kickoff, between quarters, during timeouts, and at halftime. The rest of the time, you are standing.. . Third downs for the opposing team are Key Plays. Get it?. . After Michigan forces the other team to go 3-and-out and the Michigan Marching Band plays ""Temptation"" we do the claw. This isn't the Florida State Tomahawk Chop, we are WOLVERINES. We have CLAWS. So many people don't understand the difference. . . Slippery Rock has the greatest football team in the history of anything. When the public address announcer starts going through scores from around the country, boo for OSU, MSU, other big rivals, but cheer like crazy when he reads Slippery Rock's score at the end. Unless, of course, they're losing, in which case, cry miserably. . . THE OFFICIAL RULES OF THE WAVE. The Wave is to be performed in the 3rd quarter after Michigan scores. Wait until after the ensuing kickoff and we are playing defense. Do not start the wave before or after this time. If Michigan does not score in the 3rd quarter (a rarity), then no wave is to be performed that day. It was not meant to be. If someone else tries, raise your hands in the STOP formation.. . The proper order for the wave is as follows:. . *The first lap. . *Once around full. . *Slow down. . *Speed up. . *Reverse. . *Split. . After the split has successfully gone around twice, it is acceptable to recombine the wave into the original direction and repeat the process.. . Dance along to ""Can't Turn You Loose"" at the start of the start of the 4th quarter. If you're lost, watch the cheerleaders for how to turn during the verses. . . Pay attention to the band. You'll learn a lot.. . WEAR MAIZE. Not yellow. MAIZE.. . When Blue kicks off, wait til the ball reaches its highest point, count to three, and yell ""HIT 'EM IN THE FACE!"" in unison. This is an old tradition that, sadly, has died out over the years. But I still hear some diehards around the stadium doing it, and it warms my heart. Let's bring it back.. . And last, but not least, DON'T TRASH THE BIG HOUSE.",39.0,error,0.0

Your stats are obviously below average for a freshman admit but that matters less after a year of university. I had a 3.5 gpa and 1500 SAT and was rejected from LSA out of high school, then transferred after a year at MSU with a 3.8 gpa after one semester and a 3.7 after a year, mostly business classes. I also had about 40 credits from AP classes at MSU but Michigan knocked that down to around 20 I think. . . You probably won't be admitted for the upcoming winter semester because by the time apps are due you won't have a full semester of grades for them to look at. But just knowing your high school stats, it wouldn't be a reach to make it in next fall if you nail your first semester and don't fuck up second semester if you're an otherwise average applicant. . . My only other advice is to not plan on transferring. I planned on transferring and luckily got in, but I probably would have had a miserable time continuing at MSU because I didn't involve myself that much on campus outside a small friend group.

The vast majority of the residents are undergraduates, though there's a smattering of grad students throughout, with one or two houses ""specializing"" in them, I believe.. . Typically, if you apply early getting in is no problem (this may have changed as of the advertising blitz two years ago), though as a first year member you're lower priority in placement and may not get the house you prefer.. . The co-op experience varies widely by house--Osterweil, for example, is quiet, small, cozy, clean, and ""conservative"" for lack of a better term, whereas houses like Luther or Truth or super social, but down and dirty, large party houses. Houses have pretty established reputations, so anybody within the co-op system can inform you of what to expect in a given house.. . Personally I loved the co-op system--it's dirt cheap, generally well-maintained, and provides and excellent and diverse social atmosphere to members, with lots of options in terms of atmosphere and setting depending on what you're looking for. Definitely tour a few houses before making a decision to make sure you're choosing the right houses to apply to.. . As for obligations, they are structured as cooperatives, which means that chores are regimented to an extent (several hours a week per person) and once a month you'll have to sit through house meetings to settle house issues collectively, which can last anywhere from half an hour to several hours depending on house size. On the flip side, all houses have several elected officer positions, which can give you leadership and management experience if you're looking for something of that sort. The parties are in my opinion excellent (far superior to frat parties, at any rate) with live music the norm rather than a rare treat--and of course, the progressives (where a party rotates across several co-ops over the course of the night) are a blast. . . Feel free to DM me if you have any more specific questions!. . Edit: As for visiting, you can do so any time, just email the house president asking to tour (available on the co-op website; part of their leadership obligation is to tour prospective residents, so don't feel bad about asking!).

This is super long, sorry.. . > Im not trying to farm sympathy for my ego or anything but why tf does it have to be so hard to make friends here at umich. [...] I tag along with them and have met their friends and they are really chill and fun people, but its not like im friends with them or anything, to them im just ""his roommate. [...] Like junior year of high school I got dropped from my friend group of like 7 years, . . Bad news first, if everyone else around you seems to act the same way, you might be doing something to cause it. However, if your roommates still hang out with you, that probably means you're not unpleasant to be around and do not suck. Completely non-sarcastically - congrats! . . You should ask one of your roommates who is honest and socially perceptive about if there's something you do that drives people away. Common things that people unintentionally do that drive people away are: being rude, seeming desperate, being a bad listener, not understanding boundaries, not being confident, etc. Maybe you just don't seem friendly, it could be that simple. And there are so many ways you can work on any of that, which will lead you to your goal of making more friends!. . > I can thank my social anxiety for my lack of people skills and inability to be the go outside of my comfort zone even a little.. . You also seem pretty self aware (good) if self defeating (stop that). You should know that social anxiety and lack of people skills are very, very fixable. I would know too, I've had severe social anxiety since I was a toddler and had to rebuild my people skills after some trauma. No one who meets me now can tell about either. Social skills are a muscle - some people have good home influences and develop them earlier, some people naturally have more, but you can build them to where no one can tell the difference. You do that by observing people who are really good socially, then practice conversations all the time. . . As for the anxiety - CAPS has a social anxiety skills group I've heard good things about, but (and I'm not kidding) get a fitbit/start playing pokemon go/start working out/download headspace, no meds have worked for my anxiety disorders as well as spending 2 hours outside per day (or sitting in windows in the winter), working out, and meditating has. The anxiety gets better as you get more confident.. . > and ever since then all I basically did all day was get high and play video games all day to fill the void. Hell I still do because its not like i have any plans or anything lol. [...] I know there are literally hundreds of clubs but I actually dont have any hobbies or even anything im the slightest bit decent at. . . Ok well that's not helping you lol and you know that. It's not bad to get high or play video games, and you could totally join one of the gaming clubs or the pokemon go discord or something, but you should also try a non-gaming club for balance/different socialization! Community service clubs like Circle K or Alpha Phi Omega have a ton of events, and Wolverine Support Network is a club that's literally just talking about what's going on in your life that week. You could go and talk about classes, maybe even share how the social anxiety journey is going. A lot of people who are really social AND kind are in WSN and it'd be a good place for you to observe how they interact and then practice. . . > ive gone to tailgates but im not really a sports fan.. . My comment isn't really relevant but the point of tailgates isn't that much for sports themselves, they're just social events where you crack open a beer and talk to people or dance. Go have fun.. . > Im guessing by now people probably picture me as a scrawny, pale, hunchback who only comes out of his room for mountain dew and Doritos. And tbh looking back on the last couple years, thats not too far off. Maybe extroversion is just natural selection taking its course because im 90% sure my genes are going to die off in a lotion filled tissue.. . I know you're making a joke, but well, I was a biology major and this is not how natural selection works! You'll get where you want! Also, stop being so hard on yourself, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enJQp8PhrLg. . I'll recap with more specific how-tos.. . * Ask one of your roommates if you're doing something to turn people away.. * Join a chill club. Community service is good. Make sure you commit to the meetings.. * Notice how people interact - what they say and how people respond. * Talk to everyone! Baristas, cashiers, lyft/uber drivers, your roommates' friends - ask them how their days have been, etc. Be genuinely interested in what they have to say, everyone has a different perspective and experience that you can learn from.. * For the anxiety, join the CAPS group and/or start working out/meditating.. .

If you aren't the kind to eat/sleep/breathe math and make this class (almost) your entire life for 4 years since you will continue with the same people, don't put yourself through it regardless of the cushy grade floor of everyone getting an A- or above. If you really want to go through math boot camp and do typically 400-level class content as a freshman and want to be a professional mathematician, i.e. be equipped to do REUs, research, etc. as a freshman vs an upperclassman and be published as an undergrad to eventually proceed to Ivy and top-tier programs, this might be a great fit. It all depends on your goals, and most people coming into the sequence have goals to make an academic career out of math. I've shared my 295-296 class with former IMO candidates and students starting math research in middle school since they knew they want to make research and academia their career path and this was the most appropriate class for them since they look linear algebra, number theory, etc. as HS freshmen. Or, if you are completely dedicated to making your college experience one of learning math intensely, honors + CS will leave you with little/no time for work + socializing + anything else you might wish to do at least for the first 2 years of college if you pair 295 with 280/281.. .

The most relevant ""job"" focused math classes are the 525-526 + 472 sequence (especially for quant/crypto positions) with a solid CS base over anything else. After working in investment banking and hedge fund positions where they love math majors, most of them are dual degrees with CS/Data science or are self-taught python/c++ geniuses.

Classes are generally nowhere near as vigorous, but I don't personally think that's a good measure of comprehension regardless. Put the effort into actually learning the material and you'll be fine knowledge wise, though might be a culture shock going from Calc2 @ WCC to Calc3/DiffEq/Linear Algebra at UMich. No regrets overall, and WCC classes are crazy cheap compared to Michigan. If I were doing it over again, I definitely would have chopped a semester at Michigan in favor of WCC.. . Math teachers I've had experience with there:. . * Yin Lu, doesn't explain things well, and has a strong accent which makes it worse. Exams don't pull punches. Weird grading schema which seems to arbitrarily hand out partial credit (aka make a minor mistake late in a long problem: half points, be completely off but get like the first step right: half points). Think my exam scores were like B, A, F, B, even though I don't think I was any more or less prepared. Watching Khan Academy videos was frankly more useful than his lectures.. * Steven Karr, takes a very high school like approach. Very by the numbers, but he explains the material well.. * Frank Gerlitz, who I had for physics, but also teaches math courses. A lot of people really don't like him, but I thought he was fine as a teacher. Kind of a dick, so I'd probably skip him if I had to retake things making this a non-endorsement endorsement. For my course, he let the class vote on the weight of homework vs quizzes vs exams (within reason). Don't know if he does that for all course, but having a tough final that's only worth like 10% of the grade really takes the stress off.. * Mohammed Abella, who is my favorite. Not to hate on WCC, an institution I'm fond of, but I'm not sure why he's there and not at UMich or whatever (probably reflective of the how shitty lecturer jobs are at Michigan). Exams are fairly soft, for better or worse, essentially goes over every 'type' of problem during the review sessions. Don't know if he does Calc 2 specifically.. * Joseph Wolkan, who doesn't teach Calc but does teach WCC's intro to statistics course very well. Curmudgeonly and dull in lecture, but has an excellent understanding of both statistics and knows exactly where people get caught up learning it. Course itself doesn't transfer to anything interesting (covers like 50% of STATS 250), but if you are at all worried about stats at Michigan I would recommend it as an introduction. Personally, I think I learned more in it than STATS 250, despite dumping an obscene amount of effort into getting an A+.. . A few forewarnings: even in an easier institution, summer courses run at a quick pace, and it's easy to dig yourself into a hole. If you get the option, recommend voting towards allowing exams to be taken in the testing center, which essentially gives you unlimited time to take thm. While any UMich student should be able to get a C at half effort at WCC, you still have to take the class seriously. Homework that's worth a modest but non-trivial percentage of the grade but is accepted until the end of the course is convenient, and a common feature, but it gives you a lot of rope to hang yourself (don't do homework -> middling exam scores -> oh shit I actually need to do them to make sure I get over the C line and the course ends in a week).",1.0,error,0.0

I've popped my tires so many times riding home at night when passing some of the party houses.. . . . If you'd like to do it yourself:. . 1. The tire should be relatively easy to remove from the bike. If you see some small levers on the sides at the center of the tire, then turn those until the metal bar/levers come off.. 2. Carefully take off the exterior tubing by slightly pinching between the metal frame/tire-- you should be able to get a small portion of the exterior tubing to sit on the outside of the frame. After this, you can gently work your way around the tire until the entire exterior tube flap is on the outside of the wheel frame. Repeat for the other side of the tire. The hardest part in the whole process will be separating the exterior tire tube from the tire-frame, but it should only take about a minute or less.. 3. Pull the exterior tube off of the frame, then remove the inner tube from the frame. It should be completely loose so it won't be difficult at all. Heck, it should just fall off. . 4. The tube should have a number with its measurement on it, that's the size that you'll need.. 5. After getting the size, then you can look on Amazon (Walmart should have the most common tubes) and purchase it.. 6. With your new tube, you can put it on the frame (making sure that the air-hole thingy is through the hole in the tire-frame (and at a 90 degree angle), then put the tire back on the same way you removed it. . 1. I've found that sometimes it's a little easier to put some air in the tube prior to putting the exterior tire tubing back onto the tire frame, but it's not too difficult either way.. 7. Partially inflate the whole tire/tube/frame, then put it back onto the bike (the same way you took it off) and inflate the tire the rest of the way.. . Once you've done it once (which might take like-- 20-25 minutes), then it should be easy enough to finish in 10 minutes or less if it ever happens again!. . . . [Also, here's a video of the process!

Do you find it easier to keep focused in/near your dorm? At the library? Somewhere loud? Somewhere quiet? Surrounded by people, or all alone? Try different places out and figure out what works best for you. . . - Don't be afraid to ask for help! I know it's easy to think that being unable to learn things on your own is a sign of weakness, but your profs/GSIs/TAs want to see you succeed. Introduce yourself early on if possible and go to office hours whether you're confused on a problem or an entire chapter. I've found that professors are also great sources of advice for professional development (finding internships/research, applying to grad school, etc) - especially in upper-level courses. Also, advisors are a big help - if you have a general advisor and a major-specific advisor, go to both regularly! Both will have varying but helpful insights about courses, future plans, and so forth.. . - Sometimes it's not always you. Classes here are incredibly difficult, and sometimes the structure can vary based on when you take them and the professor teaching them. I took Stats 250 my freshman year, which was the year they added a TON of new material and made it into more of a weeder course. The only advice I had going in was from upperclassmen who had found it incredibly easy in previous years. I thought I was just bad at learning the material, but by the following year the course had gained a reputation for being really challenging to keep up with. For classes like that - be mindful of when you're beginning to get confused, and ask for help the MOMENT you need it - as you probably know from experience, the material can build up fast and snowball into an entire semester of confusion and iffy grades. If you're REALLY worried about a future course, see if you can take it over the summer instead, either here when the class sizes are smaller or at a community college where the material is easier to digest.. . If you've read this far, just know that you're not the only one struggling here, and that persistence is key! Over time you'll be able to learn and grow from these early setbacks and come out stronger. :)",4.0,error,0.0

Anyway, that's neither here nor there anymore, just lingering resentment.. . . Let me give you my study tips as someone who ended up doing decently well at Umich probably only because I knew how to study. . . 1.Orgo is REALLY hard. It's all well and good to go to office hours, but go in With questions. Practice problems , practice problems, practice problems! And then when you get stuck, circle that part and then go to office hours and ask them to help you solve where you're going wrong, not just tell you. . . 2. Planner study time. Make it tangeable by writing it down. Wanna play video games? Too bad, you got studying to do for orgo from 5-7 pm. The you're gonna work on that English class project from 7 to 8:30. Write down your plan. . . 3. It's also good to completely change subjects if you're studying for multiple classes in a single day. I.e., go from orgo to English to physics instead of orgo to physics. It helps your brain get a breather and has been show to really help atudents concentrate . . 4. Rewrite your notes as you study em. especially if you type them in class. It's an active process that helps ingrain the material in your head AND helps you find out where you're struggling . . 5. join a study group or even get a tutor from the science center from the science tutoring list . . 6. Give yourself rewards when you are struggling to study. You'll have good study days and bad ones. On your bad days, give yourself rewards. Did you just study for half an hour or get to the end of that chapter? No? Ok, when you do, you can take a half hour break and watch some YouTube videos. Next break? You get to grab a cookie from the dining hall. . . 7. SLEEP. As much as it seems you NEED to pull all nighters, trust me they don't help. Instead, at least get 3-4 hours of sleep and then review in the morning. I say review and not study, because unless it's just rote memorization, you're not going to understand concepts right before the exam if you didn't remember them up till now.. . . Hope some of these help! Good luck!. . Edit: grammar",9.0,error,0.0

Straight up, while I think everyone looks sharp as hell during career fair, it is so much overkill and unnecessary. Why staff at the University promote this boggles the mind. Look at the recruiters, they are often in jeans or slacks and a polo shirt. Dress like them or slightly better. If you show up in nice slacks, nice shoes, and a nice button up shirt - you'll be fine. Throw on a tie if you feel fancy.. . However, there are a few caveats I offer to this. . * Dress standards are different across industries. Wearing fashionable t-shirts and jeans works at many business on the West Coast. That being said, most people dress up a bit more than their daily routine when interviewing. . * West coast tends to be a bit more lax than the East Coast. . * Ultimately, you should wear what reflects you and feels comfortable for you. Do you love wearing suits? Then go right ahead and rock it. If you like the Navy blazers and khakis, rock that. While the dress codes I've experienced have been pretty relaxed (software engineer from the West Coast), that doesn't mean some people aren't dressed up every day - but that tends to be a reflection of them and their fashion preference. Its also not too uncommon that people dress up a bit when they are visiting or hosting customers (so having a suit or nice getup on hand is a good idea - also good for weddings).. . My additional two cents along with just wearing nice slacks or shirt are:. . * It's fine to ask a recruiter or the person who is interviewing you what is appropriate to wear to an interview. Due to your youth they will be very understanding (and even later in life, it should not be an issue. I have done this. Not so much for an interview, but more to suss out dress code expectations in the workplace).. * Find some people working in the industries you are interested in and ask for advice - they are going to have the best suggestions. However, don't rely on what a Professor thinks unless they have actually worked in industry (I've found lifetime academics have somewhat skewed views of industry, mostly due to their limited exposure).. . However, if you do get a suit or blazer - no matter how cheap or expensive - Take it to a tailor and get it fitted! It will look way better on you and you'll feel sharper which will help your confidence. . . For not so expensive suits you might check Bonobos or Indochino for options. Bonobos are about in the mid-range but they tend to have occasional deals and sales so you can get a suit for a good price. They also have a fitting room in Detroit where you can get fitted for the right sizes before ordering. . . Best of luck.",2.0,error,0.0

Understand the concepts:. . While physical chemistry is a course that involves a lot of algebra, it is not a pure math course. Although some problems you can solve by just plugging into a formula, often times you will have to take the equations we learn and apply it to a new situation, and this requires conceptual understanding. Take the exam we just took as an example. Over half the exam is conceptual, in fact 39/70 points could be obtained without a single calculation, not to mention the partial credit you would get for knowing the correct equations to use, even if you did not solve it correctly. Understanding how to approach a problem is more valuable than memorizing which formula to use for a given situation, and I'd encourage you to make sure you understand why you're using an equation, not just how and when to use it.. . Do the PREP:. . It's no secret the homework in this class is much easier than the exam, you must do the PREP to succeed. My main recommendation is to not look at the key too soon. Suppose a problem has three steps A -> B -> C -> D. If you look at the key immediately you'll recognize this pattern, but you might struggle to apply it to new problems. On the other hand struggle with it longer, discuss with other students about how to approach a problem, you may find that you know how to do parts of the problem, like A -> B and C -> D and maybe just not part B -> C. This is much better not only because you'll recognize which areas you struggle with, but also it trains you to think about how to solve problems you have not encountered before. Often times when you look at a new problem it's hard to immediately see how to solve it, but being able to recognize which steps lead you closer to the solution will help you.. . Seek help from the instructor and GSIs:. . There's a plethora of resources available to you. Besides the weekly 3 hours of lectures + 1 hour discussion, there are 5 hours of Q&A with the instructor, 4 hours of GSI office hours, 2 hours of SLC study group, plus other study groups you can form with your peers. If you don't understand a problem, there's almost always someone available you can ask, and if not there's Piazza, which usually gets answers within a few hours. This holds especially true for conceptual questions; while calculation problems have a key you can check, there's only the solution for concepts, but you want to make sure you're getting to the answer for the correct reason. This is also why it's good to discuss with your peers.

University President Robben Fleming supported this idea and submitted a proposal to the Regents that summer but it was rejected, citing concerns about financial liability for the university if the store failed. . . Frustrated with the university's inaction students held a protest at the administration building (now named for Fleming) on September 19th. Talks with U-M administration continued during the next week but didn't lead to a solution. . . On September 25th students staged a sit-in at the LS&A building. Fleming continued to talk with students throughout the night and encouraged them to leave [before state and Ann Arbor police were called in to arrest students. In total 107 students were arrested](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754159/243). . . After this things came to a relatively calm solution, in part because anti-war protests began to capture much more student attention. U-M faculty governance helped broker a deal with students and the administration where the university was not financially liable for the bookstore if it failed.

Boning up on the coding basics will help - people have already given you some good advice on that but I would add some additional advice:. . * Do some mock interviews - I believe the various career resource centers offer that - then also do it with someone knowledgeable enough with coding to give you some basic coding ones - or have your friend do it (there are tons of ""questions"" online you can research). You might nail demonstrating you understand linked lists, but if you can't give a strong answer to where you see yourself in five years, it still could hurt you in the interview. . * Be honest about where you're at. Tell the interviewer what you've studied, projects you've worked on, what you still want to learn. Talk about those things you like most about coding and what you'd be excited to learn about on the job.. . My main point is that a good interviewer will understand you are an undergrad and likely give you some leeway if your coding skills aren't yet up to a certain par. What they are looking for is your potential. They want to understand your ability to critically think through a problem, ability to learn and adapt, and your excitement for the position. Having examples from your past in school to underline that is essential.. . My caveat to all of that is that interviewing is just as hard as being the interviewee, and there are a lot of people out there who are terrible at it unfortunately. However, being prepped not just with presenting your coding skills, but the tips I listed above, you can help overcome that by integrating those important points into the conversation (ie - if they don't ask you what you are looking for in a role, then you figure out how to work it into the conversation). . .

Really the biggest reason we don't put out compost bins/trash cans more in the dining is hall is that 1) we want to compost as much as possible! It really sucks when we see people dumping food into a trash can that could have been composted. We compost pretty aggressively and 2) if we DID put compost bins out (speaking from 4 years of experience here), people will not pay attention and will throw non-compostable things into the compost bins, rendering that whole bin complete trash. We have tried closing up garbage bins to keep people from throwing their compost in the trash, plastering signs all over the compost bins in bright red letters that they were for compost only, people just don't read.. . . .
