That said, it's pretty easy to come up with an idea and you already know you have the resources available to you. But you have to be interested in doing an independent project on top of your schoolwork. . - yes you have to complete a minor all the way thru.. - There are some benefits not mentioned in this thread -- your capstone is a great thing to talk abt in job interviews, I like the honors advising team, there's social events, etc. By far the worst part is the three one-credit seminars.

I'm not definitively saying that this is what affected the OP -- could be something else going on -- but I hope people double-check their Dropbox settings, and possibly change them to better fit their needs. So, if you didn't know about this, read on. . . In the real sync, you files do get saved to your computer in full, and if you get logged out of the Dropbox app (or even delete it altogether), they stay on your hard drive. . . The ""fake,"" ""online-only sync"" way: If you use that, then all the file and folder *listings* show up on your computer, but most of the files are not actually on your hard drive -- only a few are (essentially, the ones that you recently opened, or ones that you explicitly selected to always download to you hard drive). When you want to access a file, it quickly downloads from the cloud and is ready to be worked on. If most of your files aren't ginormous, you have a fast connection most of the time, and you don't need to access very old files very often, you might not even notice it's happening. . . This is intended for people whose hard drive is not large enough to store their entire Dropbox contents plus whatever else they keep on their computer. The original way was to use ""selective sync"" and manually exclude certain folders from sync, but for some it was a hassle, and you also couldn't check what was in those folders without going to the web, so it had downsides. . . The new way has its advantages (and selective sync is also still available), but it is increasingly set as the default option when you install the Dropbox app on your computers, so if you don't know about it, you might get duped: you think the files are there -- because look, I can see them listed! -- but most of them are sitting in the cloud. When they rolled out this feature they promoted it pretty heavily, but most people don't read press releases and dismiss login notifications. On the other hand, the fact that this is the new default was introduced pretty stealthily, and it's not what you imagine ""Dropbox sync"" would be doing, so many people discover it as an unpleasant surprise, e.g., when they are sitting on an airplane with no internet, and want to open an older file to work on it... and its contents are not actually there, even if the file name is.",6.0,error,0.0

The Residential College is a program with smaller class sizes and an emphasis on community and learning a language--it's often described as a small liberal arts college within the overall university. It's not very competitive at all, as I believe they accept students based on space. You are guaranteed housing in East Quad, which is a great dorm with a dining hall built in. All RC classes, which are a wide variety, from humanities to music, language, and more, are right in East Quad, although you don't have to take exclusively RC classes (and probably won't). I would say the environment is very friendly. Professors are ""quirky,"" but in an interesting sort of way, and very personable and caring as a result of the small classes. Generally you would call all of your RC professors by their first name (I believe it's some sort of standard here). Also, you meet a lot of people just by contact, as they live in the same building as you and you will usually run into them outside of classes just wandering around EQ. It's super nice for me, because I personally run into friends and classmates around the building and love saying hi to them. There are also always a ton of things going on around East Quad, and there are cool events to go to (like a sustainable mending workshop once!?) and a whole theater in the basement. One thing to look out for is that the intensive language classes are no joke--it is a lot of work and the classes take up four to five days of the week, depending on what you take, unless you test out or take a normal language class outside of the RC (which is possible but takes longer, I believe). Personally though, I would say the work was worth it; the Spanish classes really improved my skills and you practice with a variety of people from around the world with different accents at the required lunch tables. I've also had a ton of lovely teachers, not just in the Spanish program, but throughout the RC. It's honestly been a great experience for me, but the RC's not for everyone.

Rusty shower handles, no kitchen (at markley), but people find camaraderie between how bad the amenities are sometimes. Markley and bursley both have a dining hall attached to them, but the food is mid imo and markley's hours are finicky.

I've only seen North Quad from the outside, but it opened about ten years ago, and architecturally it's really impressive, and the newness may offer some advantages.

It's kinda a broad jack of all trades ish art education. It also depends on what you're interested in. Stamps majors who are into animation have had many complaints because there are barely any classes for it.

There's people who move here during hs and are still considered out of state there has to be a certain amount of years.. . I know nothing abt Pratt and saic but yeah. I have enjoyed stamps so far but I've also heard stamps majors complain about it so imo it's worth it if ur in state and want to focus on something that's well supported here(in terms of having classes for it). . About the history minor yeah that can be very doable especially if you get a ba instead of a bfa which stamps allows. (But a bfa probably ""looks better"" or smth idk. . .

A lot of times, there will be something like Crash Course that can concisely explain the bigger picture or context of the topic (even if it doesn't go deep about your specific reading). For example, if I'm trying to learn about the greatest kings of the ancient city of Ur, I might google ""City of Ur Explained"". There's an 8 minute long Khan Academy video that I might watch at least half of. This video might not have specific info about kings, but it should help me to imagine what the general timeline and culture was like. . . Then when I actually start reading, I'll check out the title, author, date, and synopsis. I might Wikipedia super basic info about the author and book, just to get a feel for what this text means in the general study of the city of Ur (like, is this the only book that's ever been written? Is the author super controversial?). . . Next, I read the introduction, subtitles, and conclusion. I try to think about what the sections will be about and why they matter. . . If I'm just doing a short, low percentage of my grade assignment, then I should have 90% of the info that I need at this point. I figure out which section of the reading the assignment is about, skim that section, pull out quotes that are helpful in answering questions or making critiques. I'm done. Start to finish from getting the text, if Im concentrating, I'm done with the assignment in an hour. . . For a paper about just this one book, I know that I have to read the whole book. So I do the above steps, then use the Pomodoro technique in realistic blocks of time until im done. I'll usually type up a few summarizing/main point sentences and copy and paste a few quotes that I know I might want to use per chapter. Then, when I write the paper, i make an outline and copy and paste a bunch of stuff from my notes to my outline. I try to spread reading a book and writing a paper on it over like 5-7 days, but I often just do it all in one day (but it literally takes all day). I get straight As and almost never procrastinate until the last day anymore. . . Also, I like to have a ""Study with Me"" YouTube video playing on my TV/computer while I read. That way if I get distracted/bored and want to start looking at my phone, I naturally look up at the tv and see someone studying. I imagine myself feeling as calm and motivated as they are, glance at the timer to see how much longer until our break, then go back to my reading knowing that I can stop soon. That usually pushes me to read for a few extra minutes, and I often find myself getting enough into the reading after trying again that I accidentally work through the break.",1.0,error,0.0

Talk to people who you feel comfortable (family, friends, etc.) to talk about your issues. Also go to your instructors for help.. 3. Go to CAPS. GO to your advisor for some helping resources. (I know Engineering C.A.R.E. is one but there should be similar ones for other colleges. Your advisor should have the best knowledge of all the resources available). 4.

I also happened to spend a semester in Melbourne Australia during my undergrad. . . As far as an American college experience, you'll get a relatively similar experience (I think). I don't have personal experience at Michigan as an undergrad, but from what I've witnessed in the 2.5 years I've been in Ann Arbor, it looks very similar. The fall semester is focused on football and tailgating at both schools. A plus for Michigan is that our football team has actually been good the last few years. UF's team has been garbage.. . The weather in Ann Arbor for the fall semester will be so much better. Fall in Michigan is beautiful! Fall in Florida doesn't really begin until November (and that is sometimes early). August-October is usually super muggy, plus it's hurricane season.. . It is great that you already have a friend in Orlando, but Gainesville is 2 hours from Orlando, and you'd need a car to get there. That's the thing about UF, it's in the middle of nowhere. It's 2 hours from Orlando and the closest beach is 1.5 hours away (St. Augustine- which is where I am from). There are cool springs around, but again you'd need a car or a friend with a car because they're a 30-45 minute drive. To fly anywhere, you really have to drive to either the Orlando, Jax, or Tampa airports from Gainesville. There is an airport there, but it's expensive and the only direct flights are basically to Atlanta. Ann Arbor is only 30 minutes from the Detroit airport (and there is a bus to take you there), plus there is a train to Chicago. . . The biggest benefit in my opinion of going to Florida would be that it is cheaper. Rent is cheaper, bars are cheaper (well the bars in mid are cheaper), and food is a bit cheaper. Ann Arbor is definitely pricey in comparison, particularly rent. . . I definitely sound biased towards Michigan, but those are my honest thoughts.

Although I didn't have any withdrawn classes, the common app should give you an opportunity to explain the reasons behind your decision to withdraw. As for your grades, they prefer for course rigor, meaning if you took challenging honors or 200 level courses (or APs in high school) then those Bs are ""better"" than Bs in introductory classes, for example. . . If you can spare $75 for the application fee, why not try? This is the exact reason I applied as a sophomore, because if I didn't get in this year, I would have another chance next year. . . I hope this helps and GL with your application if you chose to apply!

Some big pros I can think of are the quietness at night and 5 minute walk to the now-24/7 Dude which is IMO the best library since Shapiro is under construction.

The truth is that finding close friends are **completely by chance,** and nothing is guarenteed.

I'd so most of my closest friends I've met were by chance but also completely because I socialized with an open heart / put my ego aside. . .

More often than not, those sitting by themselves are hoping/wishing they had someone to sit next to. But having the courage to even do that is extremely hard, that is something to practice. I would make it goal to meet 3 new people a week until you find someone you can consistently connect with. Don't be afraid to fail. . . It only take one connection that really works to find a good friend so keep trying. And more often than not, having few friends easily network into their friends, which increases the scale of which you meet people that you can relate to. . . But the key here is to **not be scared of interacting with a stranger in any context.** If you can do that, the odds and time are on your side. . . Whether or not you take this advice is up to you, many of friends who struggled with this problem dismissed my advice by saying that ""its too much effort"" or ""why do I have to be the one who makes the move?"". And that's the exact problem. Everyone is waiting for another to make a move or to put in the effort. Hence why friendship making is so passive, because passive friends don't take effort, but end up being low quality because they didn't make the effort to take risks and find people they really connect with.",2.0,positive,0.5977163910865784

t1_j7n3ppz,2023-02-08 00:05:15,t3_10w704e,t3_10w704e,"I'm uncertain why a graduate student should have their own apartment at the mean rent of a town (Also, mean? Really? Not median? If I rent my house out for $10,000, and then there are seven other houses for rent for $2000 apiece and two for $1000... I feel as though I shouldn't have to explain this to anyone over the age of twelve). . The mean income in a town isn't that which is earned by 25-30 year olds, let alone students (and neither is the median). It never has been. That's also not the mean rent for a one-bedroom apartment or a studio; it's the mean rent cumulatively. Which is an absurd reference point. . . They're a student. And they can't get a roommate, if they don't have a partner? . Undergrads don't get their own places. . . . Part of the compromise of college, and that includes graduate school, is earning a below average income, under the assumption that once one earns their degree they'll be earning vastly more. Graduate students can get student loans, too. . . Keep in mind, by the way, that the university already subsidies transportation for graduate students; you can travel from anywhere from Scio/Pittsfield/Ypsilanti to campus in 30 minutes for free via the AAATA. There's nothing wrong with Ypsilanti but peoples' sense of privilege and entitlement. . . **A hugely important reason why you don't earn the cost of living, by the way, is because you don't work full time for the university all year round. Why would you get paid year-round when you only work 30-32 weeks a year? You earn well over $18.67 an hour for the hours you actually spend working as a GSI; according to the university, it works out to [$34.69/hour.](https://hr.umich.edu/sites/default/files/2022-2023_gsa_salary_memo.pdf) Which seems pretty goddamn reasonable to me, especially as that's in addition to not paying any tuition.**. . I agree that a 2% raise is ludicrous and doesn't keep up with inflation; it should be 5%+. But a lot of the other demands border on the delusional. (EDIT: I'm renouncing this point. Apparently you already got an annual raise and the 2% is an offer in addition to the annual raise, which you've conveniently omitted.). . The whole equity thing, for instance. . . If you're a parent, that's between you and your birth control choices. Keep it in your pants; children aren't a right and have never been. Historically they've been either an economic decision (labor source) or a luxury, and now that even fewer people actually *want* children I don't see what's changed. (I mean, technically, they are a right, in the same way that burning a flag is a right, but you don't have the right to free flags to burn or pay for your time off work to go burn flags. Unless you're an idiot, you understand my point.) Abortion hasn't been illegal in Michigan for decades, either, so don't give me that one. What would be unfair is people who are parents earning more to subsidize their children. These same people get all worked up when non-parents are asked to work holidays so their parent colleagues can spend time with their families, or when parents get other benefits: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/technology/parents-time-off-backlash.html. . Don't get me started on the childcare subsidy, either. . . I don't agree that the school of social work thing is in anyway sexist, and I also don't think it's equivalent to the situation in Ross and Ford, even if one generally thinks that perhaps MSW students should be paid. Medical students aren't paid for their clinical rotations. . . I'd like to see the thresholds for what qualifies as ""sexual harassment"" and ""racism"" and how they vary from the rates of sexual harassment and racism outside of the university. . . Negative interactions with the police? Bud, anyone's interaction with anyone who has any authority over them and reckons they've done something wrong is negative. If I'm upset and feel harassed by the person who gave me a parking ticket (including the parking ticket I didn't deserve and overturned on appeal, which is the sort of thing you'd all like to point to as abuse of power) does that mean I had an unjust negative interaction? I'm all for unarmed response, but that's not going to make people feel like they're having fewer ""negative"" interactions. How many of those negative interactions included a physical threat, even implicit, from the officer? I'm guessing well fewer than 1%. I also don't see how it has anything to do with graduate students or their compensation; form a separate interest group. . . And for god's sake. How many times do I have to explain how an endowment works? A gain of $325 million in the endowment is, at most, a gain of $30 million in annual budget. The stuff proposed in the article is going to cost a hell of a lot more than that. Even if ALL that money was devoted to increasing grad student salaries, which is won't and shouldn't, each grad student would only get $2000. Not $14000. That's a pretty massive fucking difference, isn't it? Now add all the subsidies, the equity, and god knows what else... you're in the hundreds of millions. For reference, the entirety of LSA's annual budget is only $523 million/year. Engineering gets half that. *The university cannot afford it, period.*. .

Take some time to review your degree requirements on your own, look at reviews of the classes you want to take (plenty of Reddit posts, reviews on atlas, etc). . - I've loved AA as a college town so far!

And regardless of what people say, a lot of what goes on in liberal economics is a matter of opinion; there's not a single mainstream approach. You have the Keynesians and the classicists and a bunch of other perspectives. . . Generally speaking, housing markets (or other markets) are a bubble if people are buying/paying for/charging for housing speculatively based on what they reckon other people will pay. These bubbles crash when people are no longer willing to pay that much--for instance, there are recessions, and people have alternatives like putting off home-buying. Or when a labor force leaves the area and demand for housing drops, so the equilibrium price drops. . . Currently, in Ann Arbor... rent prices aren't a bubble, not so far as I'm concerned. The rise in price *is* sustainable. Demand *is* there. People want to come to Ann Arbor very badly, and once they're in Ann Arbor they don't want to leave and generally have massive exit costs for leaving (e.g., students who haven't finished their degrees, academics who exist in a highly specialized labor market). There is a vast market of people who do value housing in downtown Ann Arbor tremendously, and there are few viable educational alternatives and few that cost less. (For instance, if someone is in-state, earns enough to pay full freight, and they want to go to a college that is ranked in even the top 50 domestically, that's the good they want... rent in Ann Arbor could be $4000 a month and they'd still be paying less than they would at any other school. There are few good alternative options, what we call substitute goods, and as the ones that do exist are priced similarly or even more highly...) . . . . u/EvenInArcadia has it precisely right: demand for elite higher education, and housing near that higher education, is fairly inelastic. Which means that peoples' demand doesn't change a lot based on price, whereas their demand for, say, apples, might change a lot based on price. However, I disagree that there's no market incentive to build new housing in town; I think existing legal and pragmatic barriers to building new housing are the problem. . . I don't think anything in the immediate future will change that. People still go to college during recessions (which typically lower demand across the board, but less so for inelastic goods). And high income groups (academics, parents of students at elite universities, keep the list going...) tend to be the most buffered against inflation and recession of any group. . . The University of Michigan isn't going anywhere. Alternatives to attending the University of Michigan and living nearby/paying for housing nearby aren't popping up anywhere, either. . . Pricing will *eventually* plateau at an equilibrium price that people aren't willing to pay, where people will decide that their desire to attend the university isn't worth the price and will attend other schools. I shudder to think of what that is... but I can assure you that we are nowhere near it. . . What we should do about that, if anything... there's no consensus on that, even amongst liberal economists. You have the classicists, the keynesians... . . Simply put, the things that lower price are increased supply of housing or lower demand of housing. Demand isn't going anywhere and people have the right to buy what they want to buy, so *if* people wanted to intervene in the economy, the obvious answer would be to increase supply. People want to do this, real estate developers and the city and the university alike, but land near the university is limited and the city has ridiculous zoning laws based on a group of boomers and jerks who already own houses or even own rental houses, are guaranteed property tax growth of <=1.5%/year, and have no incentive to increase housing supply, because they want Ann Arbor to stay the way it was in 50 years ago and, more pertinently, if they do the price they can provide *their* supply of housing at--either as rentals or if they die or move into assisted living--drops massively. . . Another problem with the growth of supply is that it takes a long time to acquire land, plan new housing, get approval for new housing, and actually build that housing, and so there's a delay in entry to the market. . . There are other measures that *could* be implemented, some of which are illegal, dubiously just philosophically, and/or dubiously efficient economically. Like price ceilings.

TL;DR: I don't believe that housing in Ann Arbor is a bubble. Demand for housing near elite universities is there.

Virtually nobody is coming to Michigan without also paying for housing near Michigan.. . It can continue to rise to an astronomical level--I don't know what it is, but an astronomical level.

Michigan is my cheapest option by 40-60k, even given the price of housing here. I'd pay 4000 a month for housing here for four years if I had to, and hell of a lot of people here would too. Would take out loans to do it. . . There are already 100-200k more people who want to come to Michigan and pay for housing here, and are able to do so, as can come to Michigan and pay for housing here; you can just look at Michigan's application and acceptance rate. That will drop as housing costs rise, but those prices will need to rise a shitload to get to a point where the university and rental market here can't fill itself. . . Supply of academics is also fairly inelastic, so academics and people affiliated with the university will also keep paying tremendous amounts to live here. Not just students. . . Not only that, but people who are high-income (parents of people at elite universities) are less susceptible to variability in prices and variability amongst substitute goods and complement goods.). .

While [4+1](https://drloihjournal.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-facts-about-four-plus-one-41-mid.html) buildings are cheap to build and simple to maintain, the fact that UofM students are (typically) extremely wealthy means that property owners can still charge exorbitant rates. Landlord aren't saints; if they can charge $1700/mo for a place that's ""worth"" $1100/mo, they will charge it. Thus the only way to fix this is to make A TON of low-rise apartment infrastructure. I have no earthly idea how much supply would need to injected to balance out this elasticity problem, but it would certainly be a massive construction project.. . The other solution is to beef up public transportation to places a bit further out of downtown AA. 3-5 miles outside of town, you actually find pretty reasonable prices for apartments. If UofM offered, say a 24hr bus service in/out of campus with some form of consistency and regularity, more students (especially the ones with parents that are not in the top 1% of earners) would be happy to live further off campus. This would allow the richer students to enjoy their poorly constructed ivory towers downtown, and the thousands of students who don't want to pay $2000+/mo can live further off campus for relatively reasonable rates. . . . . *\*\*\*\* It's worth noting that the ""nice"" apartments in Ann Arbor are actually pretty mediocre. Apartments like Six11, landmark, vic village, etc. are cheaply built, cheaply furnished, and lack the amenities of a luxury apartment in any city with greater than or equal to AA population. It's just that, if this is the best there is, then the students will pay regardless.*",29.0,error,0.0

It feels like everything is football, everything is blue and yellow, it seems like everybody you pass is another student. This might be a good thing for you, because you might be really into school spirit and then it's like the whole town is reinforcing that part of you. It can also be a little unnerving if you are used to either a small town or a big city. Finding somebody with a car is a big help if you want to go anywhere out of town for weekend stuff, though there are buses. . . \- The... nightlife or whatever: I don't go to parties but I have been told they are 'lit', 'fire', 'sick' even. Make sure to go out on weekdays so you can miss your team meetings and make the rest of us fill in for your responsibilities. This place isn't exactly a cultural hub of the arts but some shows do happen, and detroit is pretty easily reachable if you have a car. Go see the Tigers lose 3-10 to the Cleveland Guardians for like 30 bucks if you're a masochist.. . \- The weather: Yeah it's cold. I mean it's not like that bad, but it's cold. And there's no sun.. . \- The classes: Depends a lot on what you're doing, cuz it's a big school. Being in engineering, people will say the math is pretty bad and while I agree I don't think you're going to fail it on pure ability if you take the time to learn some time management skills. Or just take that shit at washtenaw. There's lots of stuff around if you want to get into research or special classes or whatever. Oh yeah project teams and clubs and stuff. . . \- The people: There are people who suck everywhere. The upside is that in a place like UMich where you interact with a lot of people, you can find a few people who you don't think suck. This assumes you have social skills, which maybe you don't, but the potential to meet good people is pretty good. . . \- The diversity: no. . \- The food: it's dining hall food, you get what you expect, I'd say. What sucks is how much that shit costs.. . \- The sports: I'm not a huge college sports dude but from what I've overheard on any given day we have the greatest football team in history and the worst football team in history at the same time.

For example, apparently the department she looked at in MIT has very high faculty candidate turnover, and many many excellent tenure track candidates found themselves rejected for tenure, and forced into another school or into industry. Needless to say something like that is horrible for their PhD students.. . In the end, she chose the department that she thought was filled with the most welcoming faculty members and had the best culture. Also, although their name was somewhat smaller, it was leading in the subfield her chosen advisor was in.. . Like others have said, the school level is almost unimportant once you get to the PhD level. People looking to hire PhDs to do PhD work aren't going to look at the name of the school, but your publications. Think carefully about your advisor, your department, and the research you'll be doing.. . BTW she's very happy with her choice and regrets nothing. In fact, the more news she hears about her peers who went to the places she turned down, and about the faculty who she would have worked there, the happier she is with her choice :).. . Edit: you indicated that you like the advisors and research about the same. I guess my main advice is that you **shouldn't** let school prestige be the deciding factor for a PhD, unless you are 10000% certain everything else is identical. And also, spend more time looking into the advisors and the department as a whole. Maybe try meeting with some of your advisors other students, or other students in the department.",25.0,neutral,0.49989184737205505

As much as I love the little turd, there were times in the Fall semester where having the pup made me more frustrated than I've ever been in my life. . People will tell you it's a big commitment but it's difficult to understand how much it changes your life. All of a sudden every time you leave the house you have to go through a whole checklist of things to take care of before you leave. Every time you get home and the pup tears apart that expensive charger or the new shoes you just bought you have to sigh and move on despite being absolutely exhausted from the X hours straight you just spent working on a project. When you go out to celebrate your 21st and the guy has uncontrollable explosive diarrhea while you're gone, your drunk/hungover ass needs to still take him to the vet and clean up after him (this was painful). Unlike most jobs, school isn't a 9-5 and you have to deal with varying workloads most of the time; that's really tough on dogs and yourself. I'd only really consider it if you're schedule is extremely accommodating. . In addition to that if you're considering getting a new dog (puppy or adoption), you may be surprised by how important it is to get them trained well early and how much constant thought/effort it takes. It can also be somewhat challenging to train a dog in an environment you don't completely control - I live in a larger house with a bunch of roommates and while all of them are pretty good with dogs and definitely help out here and there, at the end of the day you're the one who is responsible for the pup's behavior and it's difficult to achieve consistency in training when they are exposed to so many different people. Some dogs might require formal training more than others as well which is another time hog. . Some other notes is the logistical concerns of having a living situation where you have enough space for the dog, easy access to transport to the vet/store (IMO definitely don't get a dog in AA without having a car), and financial flexibility. . **TLDR;** Unless you are heavily experienced with dogs, have a very accommodating living situation, and have a very free schedule I don't recommend getting a dog in college unless the dog is already familiar with you and well trained. Both you and your potential best bud will be much better off in a few years when you've settled down with a stable schedule, fixed financial income, and a more permanent living situation.",3.0,error,0.0

Also eating foods high in sodium will cause water retention and that could be reflecting the number on the scale.. - calorie tracking can turn into an obsession so be careful. I wouldn't advise it to someone who isn't obsessed about obtaining a certain look and trains seriously.. - start every meal with just a plate from the salad bar and fruits to fill you up. Once you finish that plate then get plates for your main food. This is probably the easiest thing you could do.. - dining hall food contains a lot of oil and this makes the nutrition they put pretty different from what it actually is I imagine. - you say you don't drink so it definitely comes from food.. - whether you eat carbs or not doesn't mean anything for weight loss, it's just calories in vs calories out.. - reduce the amount of bread, mashed potatoes, fries (saw you comment that above) and stuff that you might be consuming already. Things like butter, or may use it are probably high in calories etc.. - idk how much stuff like cereal and desserts you eat at the dining hall but those are high in calories.

My experience:. . Math 214:. . \- Not well taught (largely due to my prof being 75 years old and well-passed his teaching prime, I've heard better things about other profs). . \- Not well organized but not terribly difficult. . \- Interesting projects where we got to apply linear algebra concepts to our interests (most of the course were CS/Data Science/other engineers). . \- The nice thing about Michigan is that is there are (at least) 5 different linear algebra courses you can take, some of which are more proof-based/theoretical and others more applied (similar to AP/CC courses).. . \- Other courses (namely math 217 which is the proof-based lin alg class) are known for being on the more difficult side but very valuable if you plan on taking any other math courses. . EECS 203:. . \- While EECS 203 is notoriously pretty difficult, I've found that the instruction is top notch. I've been to/watched lectures with all three current profs and they all seem very knowledgable and willing to help.. . \- The class size is on the larger end (over 500 students pretty sure) and all sections are taught by one team (as opposed to other courses where each prof does it differently). This structure makes it much easier to answers to questions, find course info, etc.. . \- Overall I'd say 203 is a great course (though difficult) and there's not really a reason to not take it at Michigan. As others mentioned, I'd be surprised if you can find a CC that has a discrete math course, let alone one that would be accepted for credit by Michigan.. . Calc 3/Diff Eq:. . My roommate was in Calc 3 last semester and is in diff eq this semester so I've seen a lot of what the courses are like at Michigan. The biggest difference I've seen content-wise is just a bit more depth of concepts/extra complexity on homework problems. Also similar issues to what I mentioned about 214 (mediocre instruction and lack of organization).. . . . Overall, I would say that you absolutely do not need to rush into taking Calc 3/Lin alg/Discrete before coming to Michigan and that taking them here will not be the worst thing ever (though a lot of people might make them out to be the worst classes ever). These courses are going to be some of the most challenging courses you take, regardless of where you take them. The biggest difference is that you might get better instruction/course organization at a CC, but you'll definitely learn more at Michigan.. . The last thing I'd say is that being able to take Calc 3/Diff Eq in high school was probably the single most valuable thing I did in HS simply because the courses allowed to me get an idea of what college courses are like and how to teach myself content (which you'll have to do at any college and basically any course). Your first college-level math class is going to be a struggle simply as a result of the workload and difference in instruction compared to HS.. .

Many state misdemeanors (they don't have to be gun related) meet the threshold to prevent someone from legally possessing a firearm (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921).. . This is true, but it's not what OP said, and the important point here is that the shooter was not considered a prohibited person. For his misdemeanor, he did receive an 18-month ban on weapon possession--but it ended in spring 2021. This should have been a permanent ban. . . > If the shooter was actually convicted of the crime he committed (carrying concealed without a license, instead of the soft on crime approach the DA took), he would have been a prohibited person.. . The ""soft on crime"" interpretation is ludicrous. Fewer than 5% of cases ever go to trial, because the government doesn't have the resources to try them all. The barrier for ""guilty at trial"" might never had been satisfied even if it had gone to trial; the threshold for that is far higher than the threshold for someone to agree to take a plea deal. That is not a soft on crime thing. . . More troublingly, it is indeed possible for a felon who has been convicted of a gun-related crime to regain the ability to legally own guns; they can petition the state after 3-5 years. . . > There are more guns than people and after Jan 6 and earlier actions like by the Bundys (hell Timothy McVeigh, Waco, Ruby Ridge), you are seeing a very large portion of the population that is absolutely willing to use violence and noncompliance in response to any proposed gun laws. So if you think passing restrictions on firearms will led to less mass shootings, who have to account for the violence that will happen in response to such legislation. . . I don't believe this will exceed the number of gun crimes that already occur in the United States, and more importantly, they won't be centered around schools.. . For instance, on January 6th, there were dozens or hundreds of actively-armed white nationalist attackers, in addition to the general mob, and yet not a single security guard or civilian was shot. Only one attacker (Ashli Babbitt) was shot. The police that died mostly did so of stress-aggravated existing conditions, or suicide after the fact; both are troubling but could be addressed with more stringent health screening and social support access. . . Compare that to three deaths caused in five minutes by one guy at MSU and four by one guy at Oxford, and, well.... . > You also have to think about how you are going to effectively reduce the hundreds of millions of firearms in the country.. . It would be a gradual process; nobody's saying we should immediately demand all guns be turned in. . . Cut down on gun-ownership loopholes, even where gun-purchasing is banned. Provide financial incentives wherein the government buys back guns from people. . . > Also all the restrictions will have to survive the current supreme court (which is currently shooting down gun laws).. . Just because it might not work doesn't mean we shouldn't try. We have to. Same way we have to try to address climate change even if people will slip through loopholes. Or, if you're a conservative, same way conservatives try to address illegal immigration even though a lot of people still make it illegally. . . The rate of gun deaths in this country is obscene. In 2020, for instance, there were 6741 motor vehicle deaths amongst people aged 15-24, 129 accidental firearm deaths, 5966 firearm homicides, and 3173 firearm suicides. Guns--and mostly gun homicides--are by far the leading cause of death in the age group. Not only that, but the rates increase year by year.",2.0,error,0.0

The good news is, lots of the campus buildings are wheelchair accessible and have ramps/elevators/etc.. . However, the dorms and dining halls are pretty lacking in that department. For instance, accessing the bursley (dorm) dining hall requires you to walk up like 2 flights of stairs, and the only other way up, to my knowledge, is the worker elevator through the kitchen. Granted, some dorms may be better than others in that department, but the ones I go to seem pretty inaccessible.. . Another thing to consider is that Umich has two campuses, north and central campus. If you're in LSA or Ross, this most likely will not affect you. But if you're in Engineering, Stamps, LSA-CS, etc. you might find yourself having to commute between campuses every day, which 99.9% of people don't taking the bus.

Secondly, I think you're having some realizations about life that people typically have somewhat earlier on in life before college. Also confidence and a positive attitude goes a long way, more than actual looks. So third, and I know this sounds shallow but I think is the actual correct advice: you should maybe start exercising and taking care of yourself. I think it'll help with you actually looking more like you currently want to, but much more importantly I think this will help you feel a lot better about yourself by putting time into working on yourself and not giving a shit what other people think.. .

All of the classes and buildings I have had to go to are reachable via wheelchair friendly infrastructure such as ramps and elevators. Most doors are motor powered and have buttons to operate them. Within the university housing, there are special accessible dorms which are larger than the normal dorms and have an attached wheelchair friendly private bathroom.. That said, there are a few catches. Some of the smaller classrooms have minimal maneuverability space, so it can be a tight fit to get to your seat.. Now, I haven't been to every single building on campus, but I will say that a building to avoid, if you can, is the Bursley/Baits dorms on North Campus. The accessible entrances are hard to find, and the only way to get into their dining hall is through an elevator which ends up in the kitchen rather than the actual dining hall entrance.. .

A bit on the homely side if I may be honest, and I thought, wow, he really seems out of her league. But then I got to know them and learned he was basically a jerk and she was a nice person. Equally attractive women could find lots of attractive men and had no need to settle for a jerk, so he had to settle for a less attractive woman. And she was apparently happy to put up with a jerk if he was really handsome. I think that was a terrible trade but apparently they were both happy with it.. . Your looks are not stopping you, Your attitude (disappointment / frustration / pent-up anger) and failed expectations (why shouldn't you be dating a cheerleader?) may be.. .

The most helpful advice I can give you is something people don't talk about. You aren't going to have your 16,17 year old body forever. It's just not feasibile. There's almost a second puberty women go through where they become women and develop into womenly bodies. It's just something that you have to accept and not beat yourself up about.. . As far as food, I had a really hard time dealing with the weight gain in the beginning of th eyear. One tip I have is definitley more protein and more little snacks throughout the day, boostign your metabolism and fillign you up. One huge problem with college is that a lot of times you don't eat for a long period of time adn then eat a lot at once, which may seem like it's beneficial becuase less calories but really when you start restricting yourself yoru body goes into starvation mode, actually producing more fat and attempting to maintain the current weight. The best advice that I have is to eat when you are hungry, eat more protein (vegetarian isn't going to help you lose weight- I tried going vegan too lol), adn eat what mkes you happy. I follow the 80- 20 rule, 80% of what you eat is protein, healthy carbs, veggies and 20% can be whatever you want. Restricting yourself isn't going to help, trust me as somebody whose been doing it since september.. . As far as mental, I know how hard it gets, everybody tells you that you look the same, but you know you don't, and you eat right adn workout and the number on the scale still looks the same. Comparing yourself to people who eat much worse and haven't changed a bit. But it's okay. Trust me nobody is looking at you thinking what you think they think. It's college, obviously take care of yourself, but limiting yourself isn't going to make you happier or healthier.",1.0,negative,0.4798751771450043

I study early in the morning when my brain is empty as hell because nothing has happened yet. So in the morning I usually have 2+ hour deep focus study intervals, but after that I'm just slow. When I still need to study in the afternoon (like 99% of the time with my course loads) I usually study for less than 20 minutes before taking a long and very inefficient break. Still a problem I'm trying to get by, not eating kind of helps me focus during the afternoon but I'm generally very dumbified and tired from 12 to 5. At 6 (because I still have a shit ton of work that I probably didn't finish in the afternoon because I was tired) I usually grab a mocha or something caffeinated and go into a room with some background noise, like fourth floor union or the dorm lobbies. If it's too quiet I put on headphones and listen to asmr or ambience stuff.. . . . . .

So I wouldn't try to be like those people that grind out for hours on end if it's not something you can realistically do without going insane. There is discipline that can inspire you but it's less about time and more about efficiency. There are a lot of study methods out there, like the OHIO principle for procrastinators,the SQ3R method, Pomodoro, etc. For me, I had to make more than one Google document to jot down all the times I was able to focus and why. I made a list of all my motivations, distractions, time of studying, preferred environments, whether you're an auditory/visual/hands on learner, etc. At the end I just learned that I'm not like those people that can focus for hours on end at all and I wasted too much time trying to be like them instead of making my own guideline. . . . . . .

So I'm a senior in CS-LSA, but I'm actually not in classes rn because of a handful of reasons (but I only have a couple classes left and am finishing over the spring or summer terms), but literally I was in the EXACT same situation a year ago.. . Like this is eerily familiar territory for me. I had a few family things go down and was super anxious and had some friends leave after graduating + a break up and was in the exact same position. I stopped going to some classes and got behind, CS classes are project based and when you get behind and miss like a week sometimes you are already screwed for the semester because you need like the work from previous projects for the next one, plus already struggling and missing projects you know are 20% of your grade makes it all not even feel worth it, etc.. . . As of advice, I guess I would just share what I did and how I felt. I panicked. Hard. How could you not, ya know? You've obviously been a top student your whole life to get here and into the program and as far as you have (whether you believe it or not, acceptance rates aren't that high and getting through CS means you've had to struggle to get there).. . So, I'm guessing fking up like this is unfamiliar territory for you given what you have had to do to make it here. It also doesn't help that it feels like every kid in CS is doing it in their second language and already knows it all because their parents work at Google or something. So you've really got yourself in a position here of feeling like an absolute failure (for anything that feels like it matters at least so far), and are surrounded by people who only seem to be excelling and can't/won't feel any sort of empathy as for what you're going through. It sucks. Badly. I know.. . I ended up having to late withdraw from all of my classes for a semester. Honestly, it isn't as difficult to do as you'd think and I'd recommend doing it rather than taking the Es in the class just so you don't have to worry about GPA issues for later. I promise you, worst case scenario you would be put on a special probation for the next semester which sounds scary, but really isn't.. . I had that happen and I ended up just meeting up with an advisor over Zoom and telling him about what was going on in my life and how everything happened (which he really understood and didn't pry for). You'll still be able to go to all of your classes like normal for the next semesters and it won't affect anything in the grand scheme of things at all other than retaking things another semester. When you get later on in the classes a bunch of people are all over the place as of anywhere between 19-25 in the classes so it's really not anything to worry about there.. . It feels stupid and worthless in the moment right now because what are you at right now, like midterms?

And meeting good people that I could trust, I recommend them for jobs they recommend me, that type of thing is worth a LOT.

This is advice I use for myself that may not be universal, but it's worked for me so far since graduating in the '00s. Despite the volume of words, this was rather hastily written on my phone, so I apologize for any weird typos.. . Biggest things:. . . Network! Get out and attend things that are likely to help you meet people on your desired field. Knowing people is the best way in, and meeting people is the best way to know then. Not good at it? Talk to the people you do know and get advice.. . . Related: being able to bond over college experiences with someone you're trying to get to know in the industry can be a massive advantage. Knowing what the sports teams are up to, being involved in a club, or having some other activity you're fond of outside of school work can be massive for creating relationships with folks you're trying to get to know.. . . Have experience in your craft! We know you've taken classes, but have you demonstrated your skills elsewhere? A club, or a personal project perhaps. Any little thing that'll help you stand out.. . . When given the opportunity, show curiosity in the specific role and company! I was at the latest engineering career fair, and it was infuriating how many students didn't even ask the most basic questions. It's ok to not know everything; we know most of you just want a job somewhere to start off. Admitting that you don't know much about us or the specific roles is OK. If you hand me a resume, tell me the classes you took, and don't ask a single question about what it's like working for us, it's a real easy 'no '. . . That goes for resumes/interviews that clearly haven't done any research either. Contrary to what another response said, IMO spamming resumes you've taken no care to personalize is the least effective use of your time. Go find out what makes the company tick, decide it's worth spending time on (or not!), then tailor your submissions to that. Many large companies have a person or even tech auto-filtering resumes, so make sure yours has a shot at standing out!. .. . If you're sending a cover letter, don't make it a rehash of your resume. I know you're a people person and a self starter and blah blah blah. Give me something meaty! What is your passion? What's a weakness you're looking to improve? Why are you applying to work for us specifically? If the answer is actually ""I just want a paycheck,"" do some more research and try again, or don't. You at least have my attention if you can regurgitate the words I'm looking to hear. You likely have an interview if you can tell me how those words match things that interest you. . Don't be too proud to ask for help. Get guidance from career centers on your resumes, and ask friends who are doing well for advice. . . I'm starting to recognize ChatGPT responses to screening questions. Stop it. You're only hurting yourself by parroting what it says. By all means use it to help you learn and understand, but it's no substitute for your own words and understanding. Trying to trick us into hiring you is a waste of both our times.. . tl;dr: Actually be interested in working there, get to know somebody who works there, take time and care to demonstrate your interest so that you can get past the initial filters, ask for help.",28.0,error,0.0

Wealthier renters can spread their money around to hedge their bets. Maybe bet $250 on average with ten different landlords, so they're out $2500, but they'll have options. But a lot of renters seem to be placing bets on a single landlord, and if it doesn't pay off, they'll have to hustle later in the rental cycle. Landlords don't know how many apartments people on their waitlist are betting on, so they can't estimate the acceptance rate when they do offer an apartment.. . The renewal law means that landlords can require current renters to decide on renewing ""no sooner than 150 days before the end of the current lease period"". That means that for leases that end on August 16, 2023, they can require an answer by March 19, 2023, so expect a lot of waitlist movement right around then.

My biggest tip is to make sure you work with a professor that you will get along with well. Often you can set up short in-person meetings where they will give you the run down of their research and you can ask questions. Treat those as a time for you to gauge their personality/mentoring style to make sure it's one that will work for you. You don't want to work with a professor who you feel uncomfortable/intimidated around; it helps a ton to feel comfortable with them so you can openly ask questions and make the most out of your research experience. .

How the climate of localities as specific as Ann Arbor will respond to climate change is still not fully understood. Average temperatures are projected to slowly warm, but only by magnitudes that are (so far) *smaller* than the natural variability of the local climate. . . That is why all these comments here saying ""this is the mildest winter I've ever experienced in A2"" are feels over reals. That's literally not true. Honestly comments like these really frustrate me, and demonstrate hardly any better an understanding of climate change than the climate deniers.. . [This website](https://weatherspark.com/y/16511/Average-Weather-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States-Year-Round) shows average Ann Arbor weather statistics over an analysis period from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. [Here](https://weatherspark.com/y/16511/Average-Weather-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States-Year-Round#Figures-Temperature) is the average temperature, where we can see that there is significant difference in the mean high-low temperatures of ~10-15 degF. That is way more than the measured ~0.7 degF average warming signal in Ann Arbor [as of 2014](https://glisa.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AnnArborMI_Climatology.pdf), and still more than the measured ~3 degF statewide-average warming signal [as of 2022](https://statesummaries.ncics.org/chapter/mi/). Given this, let's fact check a few comments in this thread.... . > Every winter since I've moved here ~6 years ago has been suspiciously mild lol. . If you've only been here 6 years, how do you know that? [2022](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2022/Historical-Weather-during-2022-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature), [2021](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2021/Historical-Weather-during-2021-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature), [2020](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2020/Historical-Weather-during-2020-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature), [2019](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2019/Historical-Weather-during-2019-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature), [2018](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2018/Historical-Weather-during-2018-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature), and [2017](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2017/Historical-Weather-during-2017-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature) have all been ~representative of the average climate since 1980. There are many high days exceeding the 90th percentile of the base period high-temperature mean, but also many days below the 90th percentile low-temperature mean. We even see signatures of anomalous cold events in 2021 and 2019, which both correspond to southern migrations of the polar vortex that we all heard about in the news. In general, you should not rely on your body to automatically take averages of datasets; the outliers (very warm or cold days) will over-represent themselves in your memory (citation needed). . . > This is the warmest winter I've ever lived through - A 20 year old who has lived in mi my entire life. . Feels over reals; this year is indeed looking [anomalously warm](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2023/Historical-Weather-during-2023-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature), but so was [2017](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2017/Historical-Weather-during-2017-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature) and [2016](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2016/Historical-Weather-during-2016-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature). As a side note, [2015](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2015/Historical-Weather-during-2015-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature) was anomalously cold, colder on average than many years before it. The difference in the average February temperature between 2015 and 2016 (or 2023) is something like 10 degF, which is way more than the anticipated warming by climate change. . . But why? Well, because local climate change is *not felt year-to-year*; annual atmospheric variability induces too much noise in the temperature series of a specific place to easily ""sense"" global warming without taking *long time means* (as is done on page 2 of [this report](https://glisa.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AnnArborMI_Climatology.pdf)). . . If an old man tells you, ""winters in MI are warmer than I remember them being as a child"", that is probably true. If someone instead tells you, ""this is the warmest winter in Ann Arbor in 10 years! Climate change, amirite!"", it is probably just confirmation bias.. . > i've lived in MI for 32 of my 34 years. it definitely used to get colder earlier and last longer. if there wasn't constant snow, it was always cold. we wore our coats to go trick-or-treating.... . Again, we are talking about temperature change of a *few* degrees. In 1991, the average temperature was ~1 degF lower than it was in 2014 (again see [page 2](https://glisa.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AnnArborMI_Climatology.pdf)). I wish I had a more recent source, but didn't find one; let's just extrapolate to 2 degF today. Is your body really noticing that 2 degree mean change, while also experiencing 10-15 degF high-low temperature variance on a daily-weekly timescale? Probably not. It seems more likely to me that consumer-level winter clothing technology has improved since 1991, so you no longer need to freeze your balls off on Halloween.. . > This is an unusual winter for Ann Arbor for sure.... . Not really, see above. . > ive lived here for 15 years and this is the mildest winter I can remember. usually it's below 0 for weeks on end by jan and feb. . Again, not true at all; see above. Not even the 90th percentile of low 1980-2016 average temperatures hits zero. The only time I see anything remotely close to this happening in the data was during the [2015](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/16511/2015/Historical-Weather-during-2015-in-Ann-Arbor-Michigan-United-States#Figures-Temperature) polar vortex migration, but even during that period we see daily highs of >20 degF.. . > Normally it starts in late October. This is a terrifyingly mild winter. Source: have lived in A2 over a decade.. . You've had your head in your bum for over a decade (see above). . Climate change is super important.

The University of Michigan is launching the Alumni Brain Health Study https://umhealthresearch.org/#studies/HUM00210711 to research the long-term impacts of college athletics participation and concussions on neurological health. The pilot study, https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/pilot-studies-common-uses-and-misuses which is being conducted by the Concussion Center and the University Athletic Department, will compare data from U-M alumni who were athletes at the University and those that weren't. All University alumni in the study must have graduated at least 10 years ago.. . Dr. James Eckner, associate director of research for the Concussion Center, told The Michigan Daily the survey-based pilot study will lay the groundwork for further exploration of the relationship between concussions and brain health and help establish what sample size and funds may be needed for a future project.. . ""(What) we're currently doing ... is a pilot study and it's limited to a web-based survey,"" Eckner said. ""The goal is that we will take what we learned from the pilot study and develop it into a larger future study that would include additional data collection, potentially including in-person kind of assessments, potentially neuroimaging (and) potentially blood biomarkers."". . According to Eckner, the survey will include questions about concussion history, demographics, cognitive function, mood and sports participation, including pre-college, during college and post-college participation.. ""We get about as granular as you can get in an online survey,"" Eckner said. ""We try to get a kind of a well-rounded picture of the respondent, but again the main things relate to the sport history, concussion history and cognitive and mood standardized outcomes."". . Dr. Philip Veliz, associate professor in the School of Nursing and one of the study's principal investigators, spoke with The Daily about the study's importance for furthering public concussion awareness and advancing research on the lasting impacts of concussions.. . ""A lot of things get put out in the media that we're really not 100% sure about,"" Veliz said. ""By the time 12th grade rolls around, about 20% of the adolescent population has already sustained (a concussion) https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-kids-concussions/one-in-five-u-s-adolescents-has-sustained-a-concussion-idUSKCN1C2056 ... the majority of these are mild, but we really don't know the longer-term impacts of how these types of injuries really shape development over time."". . Experts estimate https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4274166/ that there are between 1.6 and 3 million sports-related concussions a year in the U.S. A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury caused by an impact to the head which shakes the brain within the skull and leads to chemical changes in the brain. The injury can occur during a variety of activities, but is often a risk of participating in athletics.. . Eckner said sports come with social-emotional and physical benefits, but they also carry risks, some of which are not yet well understood.. . ""The short-term risks, things like fracture, sprain, concussion, that's kind of easy to understand,"" Eckner said. ""What's a little harder to understand is the potential long-term risks, specifically to your brain."". . According to Eckner, questions remain about why some athletes develop brain health issues later in life, while others do not.. . ""Some sets of former athletes, as they age, seem to develop neurological problems,"" Eckner said. ""They seem to be related to the history of concussions and the impacts that they experienced when they were younger."" . . Engineering senior Claire Dawson, a player on the U-M women's soccer team, said she has not experienced a concussion herself, but knows of other soccer players who have.. . ""(Getting a concussion) is definitely in the back of your mind ... but it's not super talked about,"" Dawson said. ""The more studies (researchers) can do on it the better. Obviously, you want to limit (concussions) as much as possible."". . Though post-concussion brain health is a complicated and nuanced topic, Eckner said the study has the potential to help better inform individuals and organizations.. . ""We think that if (relationships between athletics, concussions and brain health) and potential long-term effects are better understood, they can help inform policy and inform regulations to try to help make sports safer globally,"" Eckner said. ""And then at an individual level, we think that if individual athletes and their families have better information, they can make better decisions about what sports they would like to play when they balance the risks and the benefits of the sport."". .

Two: you can still argue with the respective departments even if they say a course is not transferable(but you would have to find a course at U of M that very much resembles the topics you learned in that course and provide the syllabus of your current course to that department). . .

Four: Depending on your economics background, it is possible to take 401/402 directly and bypass the 101/102 prerequisite(though it is not advisable if you have not taken any Econ before), so you can save time skipping two classes.
