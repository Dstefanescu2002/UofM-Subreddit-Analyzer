The study examined particulate release into the air based on different masking scenarios and then particle accumulation in unventilated rooms, not virus transmissions or infection rates. The focus of the study is too narrow to expand to just general ""exposures"" and so that statistical analysis would be worthless.. . . Those effectiveness rates are only *total* rates of particle blockage immediately around the face, with a majority of the failure occurring due to poor fit. But not all particle emissions are created equal, and they found the redirection caused by masks helps prevent immediate high particle concentration directly in front of the emitter, and the slowing of the particles helps decrease mixing rates in the air. . . >When not fitted with a mask, exhalation from the nose produces a relatively strong turbulent jet containing well mixed particles that will disperse relatively quickly away from the subject. While in the case of equipping a mask, the jet momentum is significantly reduced and redirected, leading to leakages of aerosols at any point where the mask does not maintain a tight seal to the face.. . When this becomes a problem however is in crowded, unventilated spaces where particle accumulation builds up over time regardless. Even low rates of airflow make a big difference in preventing high particle accumulation. . . . You're right that this gives more support for folks wearing KN95 masks or ensuring any mask they wear has a tight seal. But the study does not examine particulate intake, and notes that mask effectiveness during inhilation is significantly greater due to the negative pressure inherently creating a greater fit around the face. It doesn't at all touch on actual infection rates among masked populations or how that's affected by the massive variability in viral load needed to overcome someone's immune response dependant on their vaccination status. Additionally, I wasn't able to find in the study what material the face of the mannequin they used was made from (maybe I missed it), but I would posit that the blockage rates on a person with a properly worn N95 or tightly fitted cloth mask may in reality be higher due to the softness of skin creating a tighter seal.. . . There are absolutely more things we can do including avoided crowded areas with still air, making sure we have quality well fitting masks, using (or demanding the University use) quality filtration and ventilation systems indoors, and simply cracking open a window.. .

North campus is also really nice if you don't mind driving up there (it's about 2 miles away separate from the central campus and downtown, but it's quieter and great to walk around).. 2. Don't have too many suggestions, but there are a TON of bars near Main Street (further from campus) that are less likely to have students if that's what you're looking for. A couple good places to get a drink are Bill's Beer Garden and The Grotto.. 3. Ann Arbor has a lot of great restaurants and coffee shops. If you like coffee I'd suggest: Roos Roast, The Lab, Comet Coffee, and Zingerman's Bakehouse, but like I said there are a lot of good places. If you want to see a movie, the Michigan Theater is a gorgeous movie theater with a classic Art Deco style that plays a lot of new stuff, but also sometimes classic films. Really my favorite thing to do is just walk around downtown and explore. It's a really nice area and there are a lot of cool little stores to shop in and places to eat and drink.. 4. There are a ton of great restaurants as mentioned previously. If you've never been, most people will tell you Zingerman's Deli is a must (it IS great, but also expensive and bound to be an absurdly long line. Worth it if you don't mind waiting). Zingerman's Roadhouse is a couple miles from downtown, but they take reservations and it's got great barbecue/southern food (literally gone for every meal and loved it every time). If you go to Roadhouse, HOMES brewery is across the street and has a great beer selection if that is your thing. Frita Batidos is another popular place that is bound to be packed, but has great cuban food (mainly it's sandwiches that are kinda similar to burgers). Blue Tractor is another place I like that is also barbecue, but basically if you ask anyone you'll hear about different places because Ann Arbor has a lot of good food.. 5.

Why do we have to force vaccinations upon people who don't want them, when Natural immunity provides FAR better protection from infection and transmission? Are you even aware of these FACTS?. . The ICU data is what it is. You have a right to make whatever choices you want in this country, to everyone's chagrin. Get used to it if you plan on living here, and I don't care to hear any complaints about people making choices they make. If you don't like freedom you can always move to Cuba. I really don't care what choices other people make as long as they don't tell me what to do. I never said anything about not believing ICU data, and it is what it is. I'm a man, I am not afraid of this dumb little virus I already caught the bug and I was fine. You don't need to be so scared. There are far scarier things on this earth than this virus for people our age. Including whatever else is in that Wuhan lab right now. We are going to have another virus come from China because we did NOTHING to stop this from happening again. You should be far more scared of what's coming next knowing what they can get away with next time if we don't do something. . . And quit being so disrespectful. Why do you have so much vitriol for people you disagree with? Why do you say people have weird beliefs? Have you asked them? Just because they disagree with you doesn't make them less of a person. They aren't at fault for the creation of the virus, nor it's duration.

Pretty much the only class that taught me skills directly applicable in real life. It's definitely more work than 445, but also less math and more programming.. . Affective computing was also very good, but quite different and when I took it had a lighter workload. Professor Provost is an awesome professor. This class touches on a breadth of subjects, but doesn't go super deep. It's good for exposure to new topics, but not as hands-on writing code as 498.. . 442 is an easier version of 498 and I wouldn't recommend it as much. It re-uses some of the assignments from 498 but uses numpy instead of PyTorch (at least when I took it). Professor Johnson taught 442 for one semester after I took the class, so that might have been fixed. 442 teaches you traditional computer vision techniques which are used very infrequently currently since everything is very ml-focused. The first half of 442 is traditional CV and the second half is a high level overview of what 498 covers.. . 445 was awesome for a math background of why ML works. I'd recommend 498 first to get the skills needed to actually create ML models, 445 to learn why they work, affective computing to see ways to apply those models, and 442 for traditional computer vision techniques",5.0,positive,0.9272972345352173

Some of these are symptoms of depression, which can have many factors, but also these can be symptoms of low vitamin D and lack of healthy sleeping habits. Bad sleep can be caused by depression and also exacerbate it so it's a vicious cycle. This also sounds like legit burnout, which also leads to depression.. . Lack of motivation is definitely not good during freshman year; if the stuff you're doing is stuff you used to be passionately interested in and you no longer feel drive for anything, definitely see someone if you haven't already. The sooner you can get help now, the better your college career will be. And don't get too down if this semester doesn't work out; you can still withdraw from classes you think you'll fail until December 10 I believe, and there are endless opportunities to catch up with summer courses, especially as a freshman. Don't freak out about GPA either, a semester or two of bad grades will be irrelevant over your college career. . .

My best estimation is based on the historical data and assuming a normal distribution curve and that the test scores follow a similar distribution and are curved to historical data and that nothing else is curved because the grades are usually a bit higher, which is almost certainly not how they actually curve. Setting the median at the historical median (a B+) it appears that the top 25 percent get an A/A+. Normal distribution puts 34% of people within 1 standard deviation, and about 16% above it. Looking at exams only, Estimating that you were maybe 0.25 standard deviations above on the second, and 1 standard deviation above the median on the second, that averages out to 0.625 standard deviations above the median. Just by rough estimation, say 60 percent of the data in the 34% region is to the left, and 40% is to the right of 0.625, for the overall data set, that would put you at roughly the top 30% which would be, based on the historical overalls, an A-. Pretending the rest of the assignments aren't curved and that you have near perfect scores, that would put you at a high A-, low A. Alternatively, you can use a bump curve method, which assumes everyone gets that same grade boost. I didn't do these calculations myself, but I have heard it is supposed to be about 15% currently, not sure of how that was determined tho. Assuming scores of 37 and 27 on each exam and an average of 95 on everything else, that would give you an 82.6 in the class right now. With the 15 percent bump, that puts you at a 97.6, which would be an A. I personally think the normal distribution is a bit more realistic, but I don't know anything about how it is actually curved, just my best guess at a rough estimate. You're doing pretty well tho, you most likely have a solid A rn! Lmk if you have any questions about my rough estimations. Just to reiterate, these are calculations based on what I think might be a rough estimate of the curve, and are not based in fact, incorporating several likely incorrect assumptions. They hold absolutely no bearing on the way the grading is done for the course and shouldnt used as anything hard and fast.

I've never dealt with the issue, because I'm not hauling a bunch of quarters out of there, but I think you'd find no business wants to be supplying you with quarters for face value on a regular basis. Banks will typically do that, if they're able, because they expect to make enough money from customers in other ways, so ask your bank about getting quarters. Given the ongoing shortage, you might want to call your local branch and ask if they have the amount you want on hand, or if not, if they could order some extra rolls for you in a couple days.. .

Schlissel was quoted saying, in response to a question about the link between rising Ann arbor rents, that we workers don't have to live here!! There's an organization of the allied UM labor unions, the All Campus Labor Council, and it would be great to see them take up the issue of housing and to uplift the perspectives and experiences of staff as it relates to the Ann Arbor rental market. One powerful thing about housing is that it's an issue that impacts a lot of differently positioned people, so we have an opportunity to have a real impact if we can listen to each other and lift each other's struggles up collectively. . . Absent the collective response, it will continue to be hard to find housing, and for some much more difficult than for others.

I'm not sure how familiar you are with his behavior here at UM though, because his belief that he was persecuted for his political views by all accounts was a function of his paranoia, not the other way around. A friend of mine who was in his very small philosophy(edit) grad program experienced how his increasingly conservative politicization coincided with disturbing behavior that alienated him from his colleagues and prevented him from completing his work, instilling his sense that they were trying to make him fail. I personally witnessed an outburst of his as he aggressively yelled racial epithets at passers by on the law quad, ranting to no one in particular as classmates of mine tried to calm him down before having to eventually call security. I also recall a talk on race here at the school where he repeatedly interrupted the speaker by yelling bigoted comments before being escorted out (edit: after rewatching the video, he was convinced he was being persecuted not just for political views, but for being a white man in a ""reverse racist, reverse sexist"" city.) . . It is clear that his mental health was in severe crises for several years now and he was not given adequate support and help. I am certainly not qualified to diagnose the cause, and I expect even those who are wouldn't be able to tell you the exact mix of traumatizing life experiences or underlying genetic problems that led to his behavior. But to say he was essentially driven crazy for being a mere ""centrist"" when his behavior was frightening and deeply offensive, and laying blame on the political culture of the campus instead of say the US military that led him to witness some of the worst horrors of humanity, is simply not an honest reflection of the dynamic.",34.0,negative,0.6989246010780334

Wearing a patch with heart symbols is a feel-good, pleasant gesture that accomplishes nothing.. . These players have a national audience.

They have a platform to express any idea they want, a form of political capital that expires when the season ends if not used. Colin Kaepernick demonstrated how a small sports protest can have an outsize impact. So if students on the football team want to address school shootings, how about address it in a way to encourage some sort of change in society to help reduce school shootings, or at least disapproval of efforts to maintain current policies, rather than feel-good heart symbols for one game until the next time some kids are shot?. . I'm sure the players are good people, and I'm just frustrated, as are so many people, that school shootings keep happening, with no meaningful policy changes to address them.

I highly recommend looking into sourcing large live traps which can be set out to trap your dog.. .

t1_hnc91bz,2021-12-05 16:42:59,t3_r9jjm8,t3_r9jjm8,">This post is for anyone considering applying or accepting admission to the School for Environment and Sustainability. I was a first year this fall, and I have decided to not come back and leave the university. I had a really bad experience in SEAS. This is not to say that SEAS is bad or that you cant have a good experience. First, know that SEAS is trying to grow, and that growth will come at your expense. You are definitely a guinea pig. At the beginning of the term every class you want will have a waitlist of 20 or more. The school encourages over enrollment, which means you sign up for more classes than you will actually take, and you do a shopping period.. . . . > So you don't actually know your schedule until maybe 2 weeks after the term has started. Culturally this is normal but it came as a huge surprise. If you're someone who likes to plan and have a solid plan, this could cause massive amounts of stress. Not to mention if you work (which SEAS doesn't want you to). While there's not a formal rule that you cannot work, I felt pressure from my faculty to prioritize school. This is very difficult when Ann Arbor rent will cost you an arm and a leg. If you're serious about UofM, look at apartments in Ypsilanti. If you're looking to apply to the BEC track, please know that education and communication classes virtually non existent.. . . . > There is one education class every other year, and only one section. TBH the only class with more than one section is 509, ecology which is required for every SEAS student. The BEC track is under staffed and really only geared towards environmental psychology. If you want that great! If you want the ed and comm, look elsewhere. The main prof of BEC is a great advisor (so I'm told). Moving on to advisors, overall they really don't have time for you. I've heard across specializations that they are hard to get ahold of. Mine was also the associate dean, also the person who teaches the environ ed class.. . . . >She only has time to meet with her advises in groups. I was not expecting this either. I really wanted an experience where I was going to be invested in, fostered and somewhere I could grow. To be honest, SEAS really feels like undergrad part 2. I will say, the STAFF in SEAS are fantastic, they work very hard to ensure you are informed. However, you really have to seek them out, everything is on you to find them, information, to try and meet with your advisor. SEAS just is not the type of culture I wanted. I did not feel like I was being invested in, and I questioned what I was paying for at the end of the day.. . . . > A side note on DEI, they're trying. They know they have a long way to go in terms of including more BIPOC and more genders in their faculty and students, but the school has a major problem with ableism. While I am not disabled, its blatantly obvious the school does not make an effort to address that environmental science is inherently ablest. The classes rely on field work, and all social events rely on going outdoors where you are required to hike, step over roots or rocks, etc. The school is legally obligated to provide accommodations, but SEAS should be more with it. Disabled students shouldn't have to fight for access to classes or events.. . . . > It should already be thought of. If you're really curious, their DEI strategic plan is public and does not mention disabled students at all, in the whole document. But in that regard please see for yourself. I'm writing this not to complain or to attack SEAS in anyway. A masters cost a lot of money, and you need to know what you're investing in, I hope this helps future applicants.. . . .

The school encourages over enrollment, which means you sign up for more classes than you will actually take, and you do a shopping period. So you don't actually know your schedule until maybe 2 weeks after the term has started. . This was the same thing at Duke! I really disliked it because I had no idea what I was going to be able to take in the fall, especially since my desired track involved quantitative classes that were prerequisites for subsequent ones. We also were not assigned an advisor until well after I withdrew, and while there were graduate assistantships given to part of the cohort (I had one too) we had no idea what they would entail. Apparently people found out in mid September or something. . . >I really wanted an experience where I was going to be invested in, fostered and somewhere I could grow. To be honest, SEAS really feels like undergrad part 2.. . I'm guessing you don't mean this in a good way, right?

t1_hnf4doe,2021-12-06 04:15:00,t1_hnevm6k,t3_r9tdoo,"So I probably have the answer to the original question of this thread: For the B1G Ten Championship Game, there were a little over 2,000 student tickets given out to fill sections 105, 204, 205, 206, and the 300 something and 400 something sections. People were placed in these sections by priority points, with those who got the most (42 was max) at the very front. The least amount of priority points anyone could have and still have gotten tickets to the game was 21 (sitting in the top of section 400 something). I personally had 27 points, and was paced in the middle of section 206. With all these reference points, we can assume the 1,000 closest people to the field will get Orange Bowl Tickets (UofM announced they have 1,000 student tickets to give out) Assuming the same people that went to the game on Indy apply for the Bowl game, everyone from the middle of section 205 and in front should get a ticket. Section 105 has about 652 seats, section 204 - 247, section 205 - 158, section 206 - 249. If all my math checks out, that should be how it plays out. . . tl:dr If you were in section 204 or 105 for the B1G Championship, ur probably guaranteed to get tickets. If 205 or 206, it's a toss up and depends on who applies to get tickets. That means u need above 33 priority points to gaurentee getting a ticket.",3.0,neutral,0.879960298538208

There are a ton of ESM classes to chose from. Just thinking back I can agree that BEC is super under presented. I cannot think of a single class I saw that was education related. Similarly to the projects - I believe there was 1 option. So I definitely agree with you on that point. I similarly hate the overscheduing. I did end up getting into everything I wanted after being on the waitlist but again, I had a lot of classes to chose from. It can be really stressful to not feel settled in your routine for so long. . . Can't speak to the work aspect as I think I lucked out with my advisor. He offered me a work study job without me having to ask so that has been incredibly helpful. For actually advising however, I found that the general SEAS advisors are better for scheduling and the assigned advisors are better for general advice. I can't imagine how frustrating it would be to not be able to see your advisor when you are having issues at school. I'm sure it just reinforced your frustrations. . . 100% agree on the minority front. As a POC, we are few and far in between. The program is trying to be more inclusive and I happen to be in a class with a POC professor that focuses on social issues. However, I think that's an AA issue as a whole. Everything is super white liberal. Land acknowledgments and BLM signs are great but where's the actual social justice initiatives? I'm also not disabled but I understand the frustration about the non-accessible events. I never even thought of that and that's obviously part of the problem. I understand SEAS events being outdoors but they should definitely be making plans and accomodations for those who need them. . . Anyway overall I think if your aiming for ESM then SEAS has a lot to offer. It is very established and well managed IMO. I'm hoping that people are falling through the cracks because the program took on way more students this year than in the past but I guess that's tbd. Hopefully they get back on track. I'm not necessarily defending SEAS because I do see the glaring issues. I have just gotten lucky in that I've had a good experience so far and my advisor took a liking to me. I hope that you find a program and school that's a better fit! As you said, you're paying crazy money to be here so if you're not getting what you want out of it then it's a waste. Good luck with everything!",5.0,error,0.0

I suppose what I ultimately want is rehabilitation, not just for the criminal justice system, but also for people in the workplace. We should always be focused on finding the root cause of bad behavior and fixing that.. . Obviously all of this is easy to say, but I also try my best to live it too.

He is extremely willing to work with you and help as much as he can until you understand it. The labs are by far the most difficult part of the class. They would consistently take me at least 15 hours each. Learning the software can be tricky, the first couple labs are a good tutorial however it can still be difficult on the later labs. Like I said just ask and he will help you.. . I also took EECS 320. I took it last fall so the format was slightly strange as the lectures were held over zoom but he would play a recording of a lecture he recorded the previous day or so then he would answer any questions posted in the chat. The GSI that semester was incredibly helpful and explained the material well. My biggest takeaway was that class had the longest formulas I had ever seen in my life and to go along with that soooo many variables. . . As for which you should I take I can't answer that but I will say it would be helpful to have 320 before 312 as the basis for 312 relies on 320. Now they do cover what you need to understand from 320 in the first couple weeks of 312 but you will most likely feel more confident if you took 320 prior. It is also important to note that all of 312 isn't like the beginning. I know several people that dropped the class after the first few lectures because they were intimidated by the material or weren't interested in it. So if 320 wasn't your favorite but you're really interested in 312 I would encourage you to stick it out past the first few lectures to really get a sense of what the class is about.",3.0,positive,0.7537627220153809

After a series of convictions for possession of marijuana, Sinclair was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1969 after offering two joints to an undercover female narcotics officer.. . In 1972, Leonard Weinglass took on the defense of Sinclair in Detroit, Michigan after he was charged with conspiracy to destroy government property along with Larry 'Pun' Plamondon and John Forrest. The case became United States v. U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), on appeal to the United States Supreme Court. The Court rendered a landmark decision prohibiting the US government's use of domestic electronic surveillance without a warrant, freeing Sinclair and his co-defendants.. . //////////////////////

I also know a lot of students (me included) who were upset about how the midterm, which consisted of conceptual essay questions, was graded. There was at least one question that you were marked down on if you didn't think of the specific bug he was thinking of, even if your answer was plausible. Additionally, the grading rubric often required specific 'buzzwords,' such as needing to explicitly use the word ""locality"" in one of the questions to get full points. For a class that is supposed to be conceptually deep, it's disappointing to see that kind of grading.

Projects: IMO I've liked the projects so far but I do agree with others that non of the course staff knowing anything about the test cases is a red flag. Going to OH has rarely been actually helpful for my group outside of getting a better conceptual understanding as they aren't able to look at what we *could* be doing wrong. However, they have been decently generous with the bonus submissions this semester which has been nice. . . Exam: I feel like I'm the outlier in this thread in thinking that the exam overall wasn't that terrible. Yeah the buzzwords thing is a bit wack because they were a bit stringent on giving points when you only *alluded* to the term rather than the actual term. As for the content, in all honesty if you completed and understood each project completely leading up to the midterm, a lot of the questions were testing your understanding of things you had to do in the projects (locks/CVs and their various workings).

I'm first gen, my family is overseas, I'm a female in CS, and I keep failing classes. I rely on financial aid that's going to run out soon from retaking so many classes. I went through a title 9 case with a student stalking and harassing me. I have no home in the US, no where to go for holidays, and my rent is $1600/month so that I can live alone and not make other uncomfortable with my constant crying and 3am-2pm avoidance sleeping schedule. I have felt like quitting every semester. I'm a 5th year now with only a handful of classes left, but every semester I schedule more than I can handle just to hopefully graduate faster. But, by taking too many EECS classes at once, I usually fail at least one class. Because of this, I had to make an agreement with the board of academic standard where I only get given financial aid if I pass every one of my classes every semester. It's finals right now, I just got destroyed by the EECS 370 final and will almost definitely fail the class, so I'm already preparing for the shitstorm of registering for next semester without the help of the school while aso trying to study for my remaining two exams. . . This school is set up to foster well-adjusted students whose parents support them and help them every step of the way. It's incredibly difficult to succeed here without immense support or unless you're a genius. I'm not one of these students. I have worked 3 jobs while being full-time, I have had to file some sort of petition every semester for ""extenuating circumstances"", and it's left me feeling so out of place like I'm hanging on the edge of a cliff and u of m is prying my fingers off. . .

No matter how many extra semesters it takes or how many petitions and exceptions I have to apply for, how many loans I have to take out...I earned this. I do belong here even if the environment makes me feel like I don't. I will persevere for the inner child in me who always wanted to be a computer scientist and have a stable life and income unlike her parents. I recommend that you spend a day doing some emotional digging, talk to your inner child and ask him/her what they need and do yourself the service of following through with that. I'm not the kind of person to say you can't quit. You absolutely can and your life end up fine I'm sure. I don't believe it's what you truly want, but you have to figure that out. My first instinct is always to run away back to my country, but then I am faced with the thousand different obstacles that plan erects. The grass is not greener on the other side unless perhaps you have a tangible reason to believe so. You are just scared, feeling defeated, and want the pain to stop. Life is incredibly painful no matter what side of the fence you're on, but you get to decide what the reward is at the end. . . Please take comfort in knowing that there are thousands of students like us here. Thousands of us struggle in silence and don't follow the typical narrative. We get degrees too, we just do it with a ton of bricks on our back, maybe depression, maybe anxiety, maybe isolation is a factor. That doesn't mean we stop fighting for ourselves.

t1_homp8p1,2021-12-15 10:48:33,t1_holrwom,t3_rghpgu,"TLDR; grading is complicated and I'll probably give the A+ but it feels weird to do so for a variety of reasons, explained in detail below.. . A few folks are asking this (why not just give students an A+) and i want to note that i didn't say i wouldn't give it to them, but it feels weird to give this grade to more than just one or two students in a fairly small class. If grades are meant to represent mastery over the material, it feels really silly to expect anyone to master 97-100% of the material. But that's not what grades (at least in the US, and it sounds like in some other places too) actually represent any more. This seems to be the fundamental tension between different schools of thought when it comes to grading. . The other thing I'd like to note is that, as a grad student in the humanities (where it's presumed that getting a PhD means you want to become a professor), there is a lot of pressure to be a strict grader. Job search committees see strict grading and lower class averages as signs of ""rigor,"" which falls into that older way of thinking about grades as still truly representative of mastery. This can be a real problem, because especially for women and people of color, if you're a stricter grader you're still more likely to get blowback from students (I know someone who was *sued* for giving a student an A-, and I've gotten some truly mean comments on evals or online after giving A- and B+ grades). Obviously this feels super crappy, especially because for instructors, often we see a B+ as a good grade (obviously it depends on how you were trained and your own undergrad experience though). And it can feel shitty to be labeled an ""easy grader"" (especially as a woman, where often female instructors are expected by students, however subconsciously, to be ""caring"" and ""nurturing"" and giving lots of As is kind of a weird proxy for this).. So, the alternative form of grading was meant to try to mitigate some of these pressures by giving students the possibility to make up for assignments on which they did poorly, while still giving me the ability to give actually representative feedback (essentially separating the feedback/grade a bit more from the possibility of success in the class, and from the idea of the grader as ""mean"" for giving a representative grade). But this being the first time using this system, there were obviously some unintended consequences, and now I'm living with that while trying to understand them (thus asking Reddit lol).",13.0,error,0.0

Oh wow, this is incredible. I just looked all around my house and I still can't find who fucking asked.. . Who is this clown trying to impress?

It's certainly an achievement, but far from anything special.. . Of course you can fail classes and still succeed. Of course 99% of what you learn in school won't be used in a work setting. *Everybody* knows this, I don't know why this butthead thinks they're imparting divine knowledge onto the dumb students. That isn't the issue though. The issue is that (from what I can tell) the exam was not a fair assessment for what students learned throughout the semester. That is a failure on the part of the class and the instructors. Not the students.. . Also, I know that this instructor probably wrote this in a fit of rage while taking a messy shit, but think about the message being conveyed here. ""I got an F and I'll be making big money anyway."" The instructor is essentially telling students that they shouldn't give two shits about EECS 370, or really any classes they'll be taking in their time at university. That is a TERRIBLE message to be conveyed, let alone by someone who is supposed to be a guiding academic figure representing the EECS department. If this person had any plans to continue teaching EECS 370, I sincerely hope that they never get the chance to teach a course again in their life, because this makes the EECS program as a whole look absolutely *awful*.. . > We tried changing up the exam to better test you all on the material in a better way than previous exams. This was obviously our first semester doing it. . Hold up. This instructor is talking out both sides of their mouth. Apparently they taught this class for 4 semesters, yet this is the first time trying to switch up the exam, so they should be excused/absolved for lack of experience. Fuck outta here.. . I'm also laughing at the nerve this idiot has to lecture students about their ""privilege"" when they're trying to flex their big software engineering job in the same paragraph. Did it not occur to this fuckwad that there are students operating on time-limited financial aid, who can't afford to fail classes due to administrative incompetence like this? Or that there are students who want to go to grad school and do research, for whom GPA is actually important? Not everyone's goal in life is to work at a FAANG company. Students should be given the opportunity to fail by their own merit. A course where everyone fails because the final exam was not an accurate reflection of the course material isn't something to be proud of; it's a bad course that should be amended. But then again, if dipfucks like this instructor were allowed to teach for 4 semesters, then maybe EECS 370 is a lost cause.

The idea of a naturally difficult course that weeds people out of a hard major because it is an indication of the level of difficulty inherent in the rest of the degree and the career path is fine. In fact, it's good to have people find out that they aren't cut out for a particular major early on rather than completing 7 semesters and hitting a wall at the end.. . A good example of this is organic chemistry. That class is one of the most notorious weeder classes at UMich and at basically every college that offers it, but it is inherently a difficult subject and it is indicative of the difficulty present in the field of chemistry.. . Where things get problematic is when classes are made artificially difficult because the department didn't want to deal with a big class of x major in the upper level courses.. . A good example of this is Physics 140. I struggled with that class like you wouldn't believe despite passing AP physics with flying colors.

So like giving students a list of therapists / psychiatrists in the area and which accept which insurance. The UM school will never be a psycharistic facility, ya know? So I think they gotta redirect to people who can actually help. . . . That being said, I do think solutions they could adopt is allowing students to more easily turn in late work without penalty.

Obviously I don't *actually* have such a cavalier view of complicated mental health issues, but again its not on the university to reach down and save everyone from their own mental health, the responsibility often lies on the student to curtail their expectations and find for themselves a path which lets them succeed without worsening their mental health problems while they work to address them.

If you liked 217 and 412 (I did not) you will find it easy, otherwise it's solidly mid tier workload (280 level). . . . 281: Order of magnitude easier than its reputation. EECS 280 projects were really dumb imo, I hated them so much because the class moved way slower than their projects and I didn't know what was happening in their header files at all most of the time. Only saving grace were fantastic 280 professors. In 281 Dr Paoletti releases project tutorials where he explains each step of the project (make sure you watch the full 1 hour video b4 starting each project). In 280 you also were required to use certain syntax because they were trying to teach you specific things, but in 281 they just want correct outputs. Labs match up with tests 1-1 in 281 as well so you basically barely need to study. Go to lectures in person btw, Darden and Paoletti are literally such fantastic professors I cannot plug them enough. . . . My advice for 281 projects is make sure you are really writing code like a software engineer. A lot of my friends who were better than me at 280 (I got a B in that class) took triple my time to complete 281 projects because of debugging. People get into the bad habit of writing long functions and no classes. I wrote 3-5 separate header files and classes for each project and an assload of 5-10 line functions that called each other, so it never took me very long to debug.",7.0,positive,0.3923870325088501

So holistic and theoretical understanding of a wide breadth of physics and engineering to solve engineering problems. It's also kind of a build your own degree path.. . I think in that context having a better math understanding, instead of just knowing formulas, would be better. The Math-217 and Math-316 path is more along the lines of deeper understanding from what I'm seeing. I also really enjoyed the material from Linear Algebra and doing the proofs on my own and trying visualize like what a span really is for example. We also covered kind of an introduction to isomorphism, change of bases, and a few other things but didn't get deeper.. . I liked it enough that I would like to take a few classes beyond ODEs. I think the names of the classes that look interesting are Modern Algebra, Analysis, and PDEs. I don't know where those fit into my degree reqs, and it just says ""3hrs Math Electives and 3hrs Advanced Math"".

Most ""respectable"" bike brands have an entry-level ""hybrid"" bike in the $500-$600 price range (a bit above your stated budget unfortunately), and they're all frankly pretty interchangeable - very similar parts, builds, geometry. Jamis Coda, Kona Dew, Specialized Sirrus, Trek FX, etc. Given the supply shortages, you'd probably just want to go with whatever you can actually find.

As soon as the companies at the winter fair are released, go through and apply to all of them. Then prioritize them so you know what to sign up for as soon as the career fair slots open. The slots get booked very fast so you have to plan this out. Secondly, if you arrive to a career fair slot without applying, they will simply tell you to apply on the website. If you show up having applied already, you can often score a first-round interview. Some companies that recruit directly from Michigan around that time include Nokia Deepfield, Ithaka Harbours (JSTOR, ArtSTOR), and others. . .

From preliminary data in the UK:. . >""A two-dose series with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine provided just under 40% protection against symptomatic infection with the Omicron variant about **25 weeks** after the second dose compared with around 60% protection against Delta, a [technical briefing](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1042367/technical_briefing-31-10-december-2021.pdf) released by the U.K. Health Security Agency found."" \[source: [medpagetoday](https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/96172)\]. . Note that the 25 week mark is when people are eligible for a booster.

We know so little about this strain except most of us will likely get it if we are exposed.. . Omicron is fast-spreading, and more transmissible than the Delta variant, but it is not an order of magnitude more transmissible than Delta. Transmission is still mitigated by the same precautions used for prior variants, like vaccination, masking, distancing, ventilation, and regular hand sanitization. The proportion of Omicron in the Michigan region was estimated at 92.3% in the CDC's last published [Variant Proportion](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions) historical data, and is almost certainly much higher today, yet the rate of new Covid cases per day in the state, as well as Covid hospitalizations and deaths, are fairly near to where they were five weeks ago, when Delta made up 99.7% of new cases in the US.

t1_hppk693,2021-12-23 18:12:06,t3_rmjb2k,t3_rmjb2k,"Just looking at this from an objective perspective:. . In the State of Michigan, with a 61.7% vaccination rate - using the state vaccination rate rather than the U of M vaccination rate to be extra cautious in drawing conclusions:. . Michigan Medicine ([https://www.uofmhealth.org/coronavirus/covid19-numbers](https://www.uofmhealth.org/coronavirus/covid19-numbers)) reports 86 hospitalizations, with 34 being vaccinated and 52 being unvaccinated. If the vaccine had no effect on the severity of COVID in individuals contracting the disease, indicated by hospitalizations, we would expect 61.7% of individuals hospitalized at Michigan Medicine to be vaccinated, while we would expect 38.3% to be unvaccinated. In this sample size of 86, this works out to an expected 53 hospitalized individuals who are vaccinated and an expected 33 who are not.. . Let's set our null hypothesis to be ""COVID-19 Vaccination Status Does Not Significantly Impact the Likelihood of Hospitalization, ICU Treatment, or Ventilator Treatment in Individuals Diagnosed with COVID-19"" and require a standard p<0.05 chi-square value as our significance threshold, meaning that if the data shows that variation from the null hypothesis expectation has less than a 5% chance of being the result of random chance rather than a causal relationship between vaccination status and severity of COVID in afflicted individuals.. . Running this chi-square significance test yields a p-value of 0.0000235, or about a 0.00235% chance that this deviation from the expectation if the null hypothesis were true is due to random chance. This is about a 2 in 1000 chance that the COVID vaccine does not significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization due to COVID.. . Running the same test for Hospitalizations with consideration for comorbidities, we get p-values of 0.0015 for those with comorbidities (age 65+, immunocompromised, or having significant pre-existing pulmonary disease) and 0.0039 for those without comorbidities. This tells us that the vaccine is incredibly effective at reducing the likelihood of hospitalization in the general population, in both high-risk *and* non-high-risk individuals.. . It goes further. For people hospitalized in the ICU, the same methodology yields p-values of 0.00000361, 0.00300, and 0.000311 for general population, high-risk, and non-high risk, respectively. This means the vaccine is also highly effective at reducing the risk of requiring ICU treatment in individuals afflicted, for all populations. Even for the most severe cases, those being individuals requiring a ventilator, we get p-values of 0.000608, 0.004201, and 0.025818, all well below the significance threshold of p<0.05, meaning that the vaccine is also effective at preventing the need for a ventilator in individuals infected with COVID-19.. . View the spreadsheet: [https://imgur.com/gallery/EB5QnCg](https://imgur.com/gallery/EB5QnCg) . . There is absolutely no reason to not go back to class in the same format as the previous semester. The vaccine works and the vast majority of U of M students, staff, and faculty are vaccinated. Anyone who is not vaccinated at this point is unvaccinated by choice (except, of course, those with a legitimate medical reason to avoid the vaccine based on the recommendation of a medical professional).. . Additionally, we continue to require masks indoors, further minimizing the risk of contracting COVID-19. At this point, it is time to stop having this debate. We can't go back online.",12.0,error,0.0

Normal credits just transfer straight to an equivalent umich course, and that course can fulfill any of your college or major requirements. As for the reevaluation, you can submit the syllabus for your class and have it evaluated. My understanding is that they do this to make sure the course content is comparable to a umich course. There are a few reasons they might need to reevaluate a course, but they basically just need a current syllabus to see the course outline and everything that it covers. I wouldn't take a cc class until you know for sure it doesn't transfer. You could always wait and take it here instead. Don't worry about it too much, especially if it's just one class.

You'll really only have to learn dynamic programming and graphs which is mostly back half material if you're familiar with all that stuff. If you're cool with colliding deadlines and a little more programming, take 370 with 281. It was a pretty manageable combo and a lot of people do it so you can easily find a study group to work with for both. 376 is a wildcard, because it's a class people either love or hate. I found the material to be super interesting, but the final exam was not very kind to me or my peers. If you like theory and did well in 203 then this could be a good class to pair with either of the other 2. If you're feeling like you're willing to put in some extra work this semester, it's not super uncommon to see people take all 3 of these classes together, but I think that workload would not be easily manageable with a full time internship.

It's really not that weird. I imagine that you won't even see anyone most times in the two minutes you're in there. But do whatever makes you feel comfortable.

Swipe in, eat as much food as you want, then the dish drop-off will usually be near the exit.

IDK if you'll be using men's or women's bathrooms, but the women's room on my floor is always clean. Showers are nice for the most part but lots of hair on the floor, definitely would recommend having flip flops/shower shoes. You'll get used to that. You do brush your teeth in there, but as everyone has to do it, no one will think it's weird. My BR has stalls and sinks on one side and on the other side just sinks--I usually brush my teeth over there because it's a little more private.. 2. I hang up my wet towel in my room but I keep two at all times and use them alternately. I also have two command hooks for each one so that I can hang it up between the hooks so it dries faster, if that makes sense. Not sure about your wet shoes/clothes question and what it has to do with snow. Most people keep a laundry hamper and do laundry once a week or so. I don't think it's really different than it would be at home. Also sidewalks are kept pretty clear of snow if you're worried about that.. 3. Since you're at Alice, you'll mostly eat at Mojo. Go in from the Palmer field side (this may make more sense once you're living there) because the door is always unlocked. Go down the stairs and get in line.

A good movie that I can definitely recommend for watching. Leonardo and Jennifer Lawrence both give a good performance. Jonah Hill fun as expected. The jokes are mostly mediocre but there are some good ones in the mix. The satire is pretty on point. In that sense it is very much a movie of the time; it would be almost too absurd before the pandemic.. . The major flaw of the movie is that it dragged on too long for its own good. There is no justification for why this movie's runtime should exceed two hours. Many elements/characters don't add much to the plot. The affair with the news host comes out of nowhere. Timothee Chalamet somehow found time in his schedule to be in this movie and do basically nothing. . . The movie also seemed to lose itself halfway through and confuses itself for something else at the end. The story and message is kind of random. At first it's ""somehow people don't give a crap"", then it's crazy billionaire bad, and at the end there are 20 minutes dedicated to family reunion and other warm moments.

The mandated measures, masks, vaccines, and distancing, should be good enough for people if they're worthy of being mandatory.. . I never hear anyone mention that every time there's a shut down, there's a rebound of activity that follows. UM shuts down, students go on spring break and transmit COVID all over the country. The gov't mandates vaccines, and it makes people more leery of the vaccines than they were before. It did not convince anyone who was already unconvinced. Instead many people quit their jobs.. . What will social anger and rebellion will another shut down rouse up? Is the push-back worth it or will rebound effects be worse than just having in person learning? . . . I saw two articles I wish I could remember where now, one was saying that Israel is already pushing for the 2nd booster/4th shots while another article was talking about how Omicron is largely unaffected by the vaccines. ffs",5.0,neutral,0.638066828250885
