At the end of the day, if you aren't comfortable cancelling classes, there are other ways you can support. You can still sign up for picket shifts outside of class time, and you could hold class discussions about the contract negotiations (I know some lecturers and tenure faculty did that last year for GEO). .

Some of them care about it and do a great job anyway, but a lot ... don't. Especially in STEM fields.. . This was many years ago now, but the best math courses I ever had were Calc 1 and 2 that I took at Oakland University during high school. Heck, compared to OU, EMU is a prestigious institution, but the professor I had there was fantastic. He was engaged and energetic, he explained concepts better than anyone, and he clearly cared about students' success. The profs I had at UM for 215 and 216, maybe not so much. They meant well, but it wasn't the same. At the time, I was as surprised as you are.. . What I've figured out in retrospect, years after getting my degree, is: the advantage you're getting from an undergrad education at UM is not quality teaching, but quality **peers**. If you take full advantage of that - find good people to group up with for projects, study with, etc. - then it can absolutely be worth it. But if you're looking for consistently good teaching - it's sad and weird to say it, but you're actually in the wrong place.. .

t1_hcj7s2t,2021-09-12 06:24:55,t3_pmj9cd,t3_pmj9cd,"Hey. I have diagnosed Aspergers and am super fucking gay. . . Honestly? As a tough love moment, I think you could work a lot harder on being more likeable and less confrontational. I know it might seem natural and normal to you, but people really don't like being told what they're doing wrong or that they're ""special snowflakes."" . . A more diplomatic way to word that last sentiment, for example, is ""I don't feel comfortable in most lgbtq+ groups; I think a lot of people in them tend to separate themselves from ""the straights"" unnecessarily as well as over-exaggerate their experiences because they think being gay/trans is trendy."" Have you tried lgbtq* groups, by the way, or are you just assuming that this will be the case? . . I know it seems like everyone here is into football and that you have to be too to fit in, but that's not the case--for example, tonight I met a lovely group of new people, none of whom were interested in the game, at the Union and played board games. I find the stadium kind of disorienting and overwhelming; you may as well and you shouldn't force yourself to do things like that if they'll make you stressed and that you're an ""unlikeable freak."" . . The Spectrum Center could likely put you in touch with other gay guys on campus or other good resources; you wouldn't have to interact with the special-snowflake cohort you reference. (By the way--I checked out your post history. While of course you haven't done anything wrong, I would encourage you to preemptively educate yourself about safe sex practices, which is another thing the center may be able to help you with/direct you towards.). . It can also be helpful to gain an outside perspective on what you might be struggling with socially/when trying to connect with other people; I've been seeing a therapist for about 3 years and it's helped me a lot. You could seek out social skills coaching or personal therapy--it seems to me as though your anxiety/depression may be making you kind of pessimistic and a ""drag"" of sorts to be around--or a group on campus like the one [CAPS runs.](https://caps.umich.edu/content/students-autism-spectrum) Or, do you have a neurotypical friend from high school who might be able to provide feedback or be your social wingman?",5.0,error,0.0

The per-minute rate, rather than per-distance rate, encourages unsafe behavior, and I think it's kind of crazy that the city allows it.. .

I agree with those saying to apply online first because honestly not to be a jerk but it seems like ""apply online"" might mean they like you, or might be their polite rejection response, or it might be their way of telling you you should've already done that (no way to know), because if you already applied it shows you're serious and they can't blow you off with that response as easily.

How many people contributed to the coughing you may ask, I estimate no more than 10.

For the sake of the argument let's say half of those 10 people are not affected by these two conditions, still if they are not experiencing any other covid-like symptoms, they have the benefit of the doubt from me. My point being, hearing people coughing in class, especially in large lectures, is a *poor indicator* for the spread of covid.. . Even after the first football game, the more likely superspreader events, our test positivity rate remains below 2%, which meets both CDC and WHO recommendations ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community/schools-childcare/indicators-thresholds-table.pdf)) for lowered transmission risk. We will see what happens after that Washington game this week, but I doubt much will change.. . The best you can do is protect yourself well, wash your hands often, and get tested through CSTP weekly. That's my plan anyways.. .

The reason I chose to double major was because I was interested in both fields and thought it would allow me to get into a wide range of jobs. I quickly learned through job/internship searching that you generally get put into one role (e.g. only software or only CAD, etc.). There are very few opportunities to actually apply both fields in one job (startups are a good example where you may need to ""wear many hats"" though). Luckily for me, the field I ended up in (currently doing M.S. in Robotics at UMICH) really benefits from this multi-disciplinary background.. . My advice for you is to consider why you want to do both majors. If you want to get more job opportunities, a double major may not be great unless they can really be combined in some way (e.g. robotics in my case). Perhaps you should look into companies that develop software for biochem research or something.. . If you are doing it because you are interested in both fields, then you would need to consider whether the extra work / tuition is worth it for you. If money is an issue but you are still interested in the field, a major in CS and minor in biochem (if they offer that) may be better.

If you're not interested in graduate school and don't want to be a lab technician (and probably make way more money starting), then I would go CS with biochem minor.

Office hours dont need to be project debugging hours - piazza is the solution to that, and it scales well and is well done for the big classes.. . Debugging is a long process, and the instructors arent required to do it for you - you should learn to do it yourself. If you can't even narrow down where your error is, thats a lack of skill more than anything (or some wacky bug that you might be better off restarting from scratch for). . These classes arent supposed to teach you all the ins and outs of C++, they are to teach you to teach yourself. That means you should make an attempt, and if you get stuck, doccument what you have done, and ask on pizza.. . I would be fine with them solving this issue by just not allowing the instructors to debug projects during OH. Piazza is a much better forum for this kind of help, and is much more similar to what you will get in the workplace (with slack or something).. . Also, staffing IAs is hard and expensive. They cost $250/week (minimum), and the instructors cost a ton more. And you cant pay them less, as anyone who can be an IA here could probably also get a part time job paying more elsewhere. So you cant lower cost without getting shittier IAs, you cant just add more IAs, and while I agree that we need more Lecturer IVs (the guys that run the massive classes rlly well, like 281 bc they do less resarch), that isnt gonna solve the problem. . . 1 instructor can only debug ~10 people in that hour. With 1200 students in 281, assuming everyone needs help twice per project, and all in the last week of the project, thats 2400 requests, meaning 400 hours of office hours, which requires 40 IAs JUST FOR OFFICE HOURS (they have to teach, prepare slides, prepare hw/tests/solutions, grade, and deal with all extension requests, among other things). . In reality, each IA usually does ~3 hours of office hours per week, so 400 office hours hours in one week would actually take OVER 100 IAs. Thats over $25,000 per week ($350,000 per semester) for a service they dont need to provide to teach the material.. . And that still only gives each student a total of 12 minutes of help per project (24 if everyone starts early). . Now doing that with lecturers instead? You are gonna be paying over a million just to run 281 office hours. Its not worth it for anyone to make that investment",5.0,error,0.0

Any good therapist knows their own limitations, and can handle a situation in which it might be best to help the client connect with someone who might be a better fit, whether that is a trauma specialist or otherwise. Some therapists may not bring it up unless the client does (unless the therapist can tell very clearly they are not the right person for the client). I think it's totally ok to say you would like to explore working with a different therapist that specializes in whatever it is you need/want support with. The most important thing is that you get the help and support you need and deserve, and your therapist should know that. Hopefully, they may even be able to assist you in looking for a new therapist, and potentially assist with the transition to a new therapist too. . . Def connect with CAPS, but know that they can take a long time to connect with. So its better to start that process ASAP if you are interested.

Every single semester I think I'm gonna get on top of my work from the start, but sometimes it just isn't in the cards immediately. For example, this week I was so invested in career fair that I had to neglect doing some of my homework until much later. It isn't a good feeling to be rushing to submit something at 11:45 when it's due at midnight, but it happened. I'll still be dealing with that fallout for the next week or so until I can get back on track. Organize and plan very well so that you don't have dead time in your schedule when you could be productive. I keep a small notebook in my pocket where I write down any tasks I need to work on as I think of them so that I can plan accordingly. It can appear to be overwhelming at first, but I recommend that you start implementing a cutoff point for your work. Give yourself at least an hour or two to yourself each day. If you're constantly working, your brain will not have the rest time to be able to make those important connections subconsciously. Find a way to get yourself out of your work for some period of time, and live in the present to forget about the work for a bit. . . . Mirroring the other advice, CAPS is pretty good. They've got massage chairs on north if you wanna use them. In terms of your course for 115 itself, start going to office hours if you haven't already. If a person's office hours don't help you get something, then pick somebody else and go to their OH instead. Repeat until you find somebody who is excellent at explaining rather than doing the bare minimum.

First, it is a lot of work, webwork is not always straightforward and the group work that everyone rightfully hates is always extra difficult. Second, both 115 and 116 are often poorly taught and students ended up having to spend a lot of time outside lecture to learn the contents again. This was certainly the case for me. . . Is an A doable tho? Absolutely yes, I did it and so did several friends. Reading the textbook, doing practice problems and going to office hours are all great advices. But the single most important one is to practice past exams; after all you get most of your final grade from the exams. I usually started preparing a week in advance by grinding old exams, and I will have done four or five by the actual exam. As another comment said, there are only so many ways that they can test you.

These are by no means course specific but some generally tips to help you do well in class (and maybe life? Still trying to figure this part out haha). . It's difficult for the following reasons. 1. You have to be able to learn on your own. Learning is always open book.. 2. You are being graded relative to your peers which are usually just as smart as you (everyone u meet is probably the valedictorian of their graduating class). 3. You need to realize when to seek help and go to office hours (most ppl either too quick to give up so they don't know what they don't know or never-say-die and experience some serious burnouts) . 4. Probably one of the first classes you take here. It's okay to take your time to find ur bearings. Talk to your professors and peers. . 5. You need to go out of your way to form study groups (can't honestly stress this enough. This not only gives perspective on where everybody else's at it assigns implicit accountability that u need to pull yourself together and gives u safety net whenever u need it. Remember to pull your weight. Don't be a deadweight. People won't appreciate it and trust is hard to restore once lost). 6. People tend to cram two days or even the day before an exam and hope they score well. They always complain about how hard the exam is since the beginning of time. Don't be them. Study a bit everyday and be honest about what you don't know and seek help when you need it. This goes a long way. Even/especially after school.,5.0,neutral,0.5963677167892456

t1_hdxcois,2021-09-23 04:08:52,t3_ptkhqe,t3_ptkhqe,"Hello! I lived in Island Drive from August 2015 to August 2017. The following is an in-depth review I share with anyone asking about their condition. Keep in mind this was a while ago now, so I can't comment on the current management, but I don't imagine the condition of the buildings or infrastructure has changed that much. . . ----. . I lived at Island Drive for about 2 years (I moved into a 1-bedroom in August 2015). I had some minor issues in the first year, but over the summer of 2016 I started facing more major issues that finally caused me to buy my own place. Overall, the location is nice and the apartment is spacious, but the organization of the management staff is lacking, and the condition of the apartments is downright dangerous and borderline uninhabitable. I would imagine that many students may put up with these conditions for the price, but I'm an adult that is pretty well-versed in acceptable building standards and my rights as a tenant, and many practices at these apartments are illegal and completely unacceptable. More details below:. . PROS:. 1. Location: I was in an apartment right next to the river, which was beautiful year-round. The bike trail ran directly in front of my apartment, and I loved running or biking down the river or simply hanging out at Island Park. It's a very short drive or longer walk downtown, and it's a perfect distance from North Campus that you're far enough away from undergrads but still close enough if you're a grad student. It's about a 5-minute drive to my work, so it was a perfect location for me.. . 2. Safety: There are people around all the time, and I never felt unsafe. As a person that watches a lot of Dateline, I tend to have an active imagination for bad things that could happen, and I never felt uneasy walking around at night.. . 3. Size: The apartment is very spacious and has a lot of storage. It also includes a storage locker in the basement that's approximately the size of a batting cage. I used it to store empty boxes and seasonal items, but I've seen other people put bikes or large appliances in theirs. . . . CONS:. 1. Office/Staff: I've mainly had a problem with their disorganization. When I was moving in, they mailed me the wrong lease twice. When I finally signed the correct lease, it stated that I would have my first rent payment due October 1st. A couple days after September 1st, though, I received an email asking why I hadn't paid rent yet. When I pulled up my lease with the agreement, they said it was another mistake and demanded another rent payment. It ended up not being a huge deal (I could swing it, and it did seem like an honest mistake), but that's a pretty major thing to mess up on a lease. I've also had them accidentally lose or throw away rent checks without cashing them, which is a major inconvenience to deal with at my bank. The lack of an online payment system makes it very difficult to hold them accountable and prove that you've made a payment. . . 2. Air conditioning: The air conditioner is in a corner of the living room and does absolutely nothing to cool the apartment. I would open the windows, but the screens on 5 out of 7 windows in the apartment are busted/have huge holes in them. I compensated by running the air conditioning all summer and then opening the windows from September - December when the bugs had died down. Let me repeat: I had my heat turned to zero and every single window in the apartment open as I packed to go home for Christmas break, and I was still wearing a tshirt and shorts. These apartments are unbearably hot year-round, and I'm running out of ways to cool it down. . . 3. Amenities/Appliances: These units do not have dishwashers. They also come with extremely low pressure and rusty showerheads. Having hot water on any given day is a gamble, so much so that I started showering at night so that I wouldn't be surprised by not having hot water in the mornings when I was in a rush to get to work. Even so, I got very good at pretending I was living in the 1800s and heating water on the stove for a bath. Water was sometimes shut off to the entire building with no notice (which is a blatant violation of the lease), and when it's turned back on, it takes hours of running water through the faucets to get it back from brown to clear. I always kept a 24-pack of water on hand so that I would never be without water. . . 4. Compliance with housing codes: This is something that became more of an issue over the course of my lease. I've highlighted the main points below:. - When I moved in, my lease clearly stated that the unit came with 2 smoke alarms (in compliance with the law) that should be connected to the others in the building. Neither of the ones in my unit were functioning (even with brand new batteries), so I brought it to the attention of maintenance. After submitting 3 different maintenance requests and sending an email to management (went unanswered), I finally went out and bought my own. Even though I feel safer, they're not connected to the building anymore, so if there's a fire in my unit, no other alarms in the building would go off until it's too late.. - The common areas of the building are not well-maintained. At one point, a window at the front door of my building shattered. There was broken glass all over the ground, jagged glass hanging in the frame, and the building door could easily be opened from the outside by reaching through the window. I submitted a maintenance request the first day I noticed it, but it was ignored. I submitted another request a couple days later and called the emergency maintenance line, but still nothing. I emailed management and highlighted my concerns about safety (especially with kids living in the building), but what it finally took was threatening to call the City Housing Department and report them before they finally cleaned it up and fixed it. . - Lights in the common hallways aren't kept in working condition- it's at the point where I can't do my laundry at night because I don't feel safe going into the unlit basement by myself. . - There's an exposed water heater pipe running through my closet that is unmarked and not insulated, and I thankfully discovered it when I took out a backpack that had been leaning against the pipe and found a hole burned through the backpack. If something flammable had been touching the pipe, it could have started a fire that no one else in the building would know about because we don't have connected smoke alarms. . Overall, these buildings and management are in desperate need of an inspection to get them back up to code. . . 5. Cleanliness: There are an ungodly amount of spiders in my unit. I figured I would get a couple being right next to the river, but I killed, on average, between 10 and 20 spiders a day. The problem got a little better after I requested a pest control service come, but it's still far more spiders than normal. All my window screens are either bent or have holes, the baseboard radiator covers are rusting and falling off, and the countertop in the kitchen is peeling in many locations. Also for the grounds in general, the leaves were not raked in the fall, and walkways were very rarely shoveled/plowed in the winter. They were also never salted, so it could get a little slippery.. . 6. Noise/insulation level: The walls are extremely thin, and you can tell the buildings are very old. I can have full conversations with my upstairs neighbors in a normal speaking voice with both our windows closed. I can hear snoring at night, and the normal movements of my upstairs neighbors cause picture frames to fall off the wall or glasses to fall off the table. I feel bad because my upstairs neighbors are very nice people, but this makes it very unbearable to live below them. . . 7. Towing: The towing companies prowl this lot 24/7, and occasionally tow arbitrarily. My parents were visiting one weekend and had their car towed from a visitor parking spot while displaying a visitor parking pass. Turns out, the towing company took the car because the paint on the spot had worn off (I guess it's supposed to say ""visitor parking"" on the asphalt), and thought it was regular parking, even though it was surrounded by visitor parking spots. Another one of my friends that lives in the complex was towed because his parking sticker was on his back windshield, but he had backed his car into the spot. If I have friends over that are planning to stay for longer than an hour, I usually tell them to park at Island Park or in the garage across the street instead. . . 8. Emergency Maintenance: The emergency maintenance line is extremely unhelpful, sometimes to the point of being rude. I was regularly hung up on after being told that my complaint ""wasn't their problem"". Issues that I was told were ""not their problem"" include: no water for 2 days, no hot water, broken windows, and a broken washing machine. . .

The 2 hour residential parking permit signs only apply Monday to Friday. Pre-pandemic, on most game days there would be cars on Wells by Olivia and Lincoln, thinning out by Martin or Baldwin, with some additional spots north on those side streets (again, more crowded west, thinner east). But this year cars have been pretty sparse along Wells east of Olivia, for some reason. It's a more owner-occupied area of houses right near the park, and I think that contributes to its being less packed than the student rental areas a few blocks away. There are fraternities that charge for parking that are actually the same distance away. I don't get why it's less crowded than pre-pandemic though, since the stadium is filling up to capacity again; perhaps there are fewer out of towners?. . Walking from the north side of Burns Park itself to the stadium is just shy of a 30 minute walk, according to Google Maps, whether you go to the stadium's southeast entrance (Wells -> Dewey -> State -> stairs up to Stadium -> the stadium) or the north entrance (Wells -> Packard -> Arch -> State -> Hoover -> Greene -> Keech). If you want to take the southern route but can't do the stairs from South State up to East Stadium, go a block east of those stairs, to the corner of White St and Rose Ave, and you'll find a fairly gradual ramp up to East Stadium.

But some houses are more desired than others and have less member turnover each year. As long as you put in an application early you'll get into at least one of them. Smaller houses generally are harder to get into, especially ones like Linder where everything is so cute and clean and nobody ever burns out from party exhaustion and moves out (like Luther <3). party houses are probably Michminnies, Luther, Nakamura, and Owen(?), but most every house has at least a few lil events. . 2. u/Veauros is dead on about parking and lack thereof, but the walking/biking really isn't that bad, almost every co-op is just as close as lots of frats/srats/other student housing.. 3. Check the ICC website for sure, but those descriptions will only get you so far and house culture changes from year-to-year. I highly recommend reading the post I linked because I asked this exact question and got pretty good answers. also feel free to reach out to the houses and ask for tours (COVID-permitting) or just to chat about what their house is like! also linking the [ICC instagram](https://www.instagram.com/iccannarbor/) because it shows some of the houses and you can find individual house instagrams within some of the posts (which are really funny and can be quite revealing).. 4. aside from the first ICC member orientation meeting, you'll just be going to house meetings, which are largely biweekly. these are usually fun and give you a chance to have a say in how the house operates. also yeah, chores every week but they're pretty easy.. 5. lmao it's not like a commune if that's what you're asking. really there's just shared food, shared facilities, house meals, and lots of hanging out with your housemates. we haven't abolished private property yet. 6. yeah it's pretty much all, but some are less hippie/alternative, like Truth, nakamura(?), Escher. all are definitely progressive and will not tolerate racism/transphobia/homophobia/prejudice in any capacity.. 7. yeah ur not gonna get a single right when you move in. depending on older member turnover, it's possible to get them your second year. . . I hope u choose a co-op, there's nothing better than living with 20+ grimy, awesome people who always have your back (:",9.0,error,0.0

Mandatory trainings, travel interview prep etc. You learn how to interview and recruit and the recruiters come for the ""clubs"" which is the set of students who chose that career Aaaaand who went to Ross. . . I hear you - you want to get a job in that field well.... Trust me if you were in that club and in front of a recruiter they would give you so much shade for not being who they wanted. (A Ross student that is who they were sent to ""buy""). In fact those recruiters only deal with BBAs or MBAs so they don't even know how to put a non-business student in the recruiting pipeline. Think of it like a medical fellowship. If you want that career you can double major at Ross. There is a pipeline for your major you just need to talk to your career advisor / alumni and access it.

Coming from a situation where you were likely one of if not the smartest kids in your high school then coming to a university where your peers were all the top students at their high school is a bit humbling.. . Taking a page from cognitive behavior therapy, I needed to peel away a few layers of my ego to accept that I wasn't as smart as I thought, otherwise I wouldn't be making mistakes.. . This may sound dumb to you, I am on the autistic spectrum so my thinking he tends to be different than neurotypical folks, when I caught myself blasting through what I perceived to be the easy parts of studying I would say to myself ""slow down you arrogant bastard, you're not as smart as you think."" That may sound silly to some but it did keep my overconfidence in check.. . By far the most helpful technique I have used is to go through problems backwards to catch errors as I ""reverse engineer"" my answer. When reviewing a problem from it's starting point, your brain has ""confirmation bias"" that you didn't make any mistakes. Starting at the end forces you to look at each segment of the problem as it's own entity.. . Eventually my brain became trained to slow down and review work as I go through problems, catching more errors as I go through the problem. Even with my brain taught to correct as I go I still review some problems in reverse order.",2.0,negative,0.5016352534294128

Sure it doesn't come naturally for many people, that in no way means you cannot get good at it. . . I started learning coding with a few high school friends around the same time. Of course, the guy who learnt the fastest is still the furthest down the path. However, the guys who were slow at start are now just a little bit behind him. All that to say, don't get discouraged. You have more motivation than a lot of people in the CS program simply by liking it. . .

. If you managed well by yourself in HS, know that asking for help is a great idea.

. If you did alright on tests by studying a day or two ahead in HS, that probably shouldn't be the play anymore.

They don't know how to properly and efficiently study yet because they never had to in high school. . It seems like you got point 1 covered - you're clearly putting in the time. Point 2 is my guess for your case. To that end, Reddit can point you towards the ideal study materials, but it can't really teach you the best way to use them.. . My best advice: don't worry too much! There are tons of freshmen going through the same struggles, and you're in freshman-level courses which are a perfect introduction to college-level studying.

You can also just fingerprint someones browser. Your browser sends a ton of data to websites that you are unaware of, like the current resolution of your browser or what audio codecs your system supports, that is often used to fingerprint you. This is why something like the TOR browser recommends you never to full screen your browser. Also many VPN services say ""no logs"" but often they are located in areas where they are legally compelled to maintain logs. If the VPN service doesn't keep logs, the data centers hosting their servers or the ISPs connected to their sites often keep logs (in the US all ISP are required to keep logs for national security reasons).

t1_hf8qsfi,2021-10-03 16:38:32,t1_hf83zhj,t3_q0311b,"Entry nodes themselves are really no different than other nodes besides exit points (unless your country blocks entry nodes, which you couldn't use TOR easily anyways). Data passed to an entry node cannot distinguish if the source was from a peer or someone using the TOR browser. It cannot tell because the data it receives is encrypted, so it could have been selected to act as a middle point or the entry. It cannot tell because the data it receives never gets completely decrypted.. . This is different from exit nodes which get to see the raw data because it has to forward the request to a non-TOR hidden service (the clear-net/regular web). Which the receiving webserver wouldn't be able to decrypt the request if it was encrypted (because it wouldn't know how), thus it has to be in the clear (decrypted). This is the same for VPN's, the exit out of the VPN is unencrypted as well (besides if the data was encrypted at a different layer/before it entered the VPN). Probably not explaining this well but TOR and VPNs provide an encrypted tunnel using their own encryption. Data that enters the tunnel could be encrypted beforehand, it just gets an additional layer of encryption, but once it leaves the tunnel, it sheds the tunnel specific encryption. . . The FBI does not control a majority of nodes in the TOR network. It also does not take a majority control to implement a correlation attack to de-anonymize someone. However these attacks are not easy and one can reselect their TOR route's periodically to help mitigate against these attacks. In practice, from the reports I have seen, correlation attacks by government agencies have been only done against only TOR hidden services (although I have yet to see them say so in a court proceeding). These hidden services have long standing infrastructure and lots of traffic flowing to them (well at least if they are popular enough to gain the attention of the FBI or other government agencies). Due to quality of service issues, the hidden services do not update their routes as often as they could to help stop correlation attacks.. . But honestly of all the high profile takedowns/arrests against TOR hidden service operators or users that I have seen, I do not recall the government every presenting evidence they used a correlation attack to find the person. For example with the Silk Road, the FBI claimed the Silk Road's CAPTCHA system leaked the server's real IP (there is dispute over whether the FBI was lying about this however). Of the cases I can recall, it was either bad server configurations or informants leading to the arrests. . . In terms of VPNs, you are essentially coalescing your data with a *ton* of other people. This makes VPNs a highly valuable target, as you could potentially collect data on more potential criminals or victims. I really wouldn't trust any domestic VPN service to not be willfully turning data over to the government (or just being hacked by the government, instead of they asking nicely). TOR isn't as susceptible to this, as the data being passed into a node is already encrypted (besides the exit node). Also not as susceptible because TOR is a distributed system, when VPNs are centralized. But if your goal is to prevent your own ISP from monitoring your traffic, VPNs work just fine (if properly configured). But I would just caution you, that your privacy isn't that well protected if that is your only means.",3.0,error,0.0

The NSA has intentionally recommended weak algorithms before (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG), thus I really do not have much confidence in them. Second, from a coding/configuration perspective, Wireguard is done really well. However I do not think Wireguard is as easy to install/use from average user perspective compared to commercial VPN providers' software. . .

During the interview, agents assessed the individual had neither the means nor the opportunity to carry out the threat. . There is no current or pending threat to the University of Michigan community from this individual. .

Deciding which level to prosecute him to will take some time, especially factoring in the complexity of the present day political situations all around. . .

My roommate eventually slept on the floor for the last 2 months of the semester of one of his friends on the floor below mine to virtue signal to everyone in our hall that there was some sort of unresolved problem that I was causing.. .

Don't be my roommate.. . Please at the very least tell your roommate that you're uncomfortable with what she's doing.

Making the students take it in a proctored fashion in their time in the math lab/study center. Offering several alternates over next week so the students will be able to take it (obviously less convenient for you guys, but that brings me to the beginning of my answer).. . Regarding more time for study - I assume you announced this midterm more than a week ago? So why beforehand? So they had adequate amount of time to study before that. It is not like there were scheduling pressures here. Moreover, you are probably assigning more HW on Wednesday and Friday right? so basically they have ''more time'' to do the HW. I don't see that as a valid reason.. . Regarding cheating, this is a problem. As you didn't force them to take it in a proctored fashion, I suggest you will follow up with ''interviews'' over these midterms, ask students to explain to you in office similar questions in 1-on-1 fashion (it would take you literally 3 minutes to pick up who's legit and who's faking it).

I am not a fan of changing weights after the fact, that's really unfair... If you are so concerend that this midterm won't be a true measurement of their mastery, the best option is to cancel that midterm. . Probably if I would go for something similar to option 1 - I would simply convert this midterm to ''another HW set'', as you have some more midterms and a final so it should be enough data to provide some grades for your students..

This is the eighth year of my presidency and an important time to strategically consider the future for our university. . . We are emerging from an historic global pandemic and adjusting to new and still evolving ways of working, learning and living, both as individuals and as a university. We're planning our next fundraising campaign and developing the longer-term strategies that will continue to drive our academic excellence and enhance our societal impact. And we're working on our campus culture and climate to help us to live up to our highest ideals. Each of these important priorities will require commitment and leadership that extends into the next decade and beyond.. . To support a smooth and thoughtful presidential leadership transition, I am announcing that I plan to end my service as president in June 2023, a year less than the duration of my previously announced appointment. After discussion with the Board of Regents, I decided that this timing is appropriate. The new horizon gives the Board time to consult with our community, think about the future and thoroughly plan and conduct a search for my successor, while allowing us to continue momentum on important and time-critical efforts that are underway. . . What keeps me energized and passionate about this university is the important work of our students, faculty and staff and the alumni, donors and other partners who support us. The work we do matters.. . It's work that the president of this university has the immense privilege of leading and being a part of. Every day we heal, discover, teach and serve - advancing a public mission and strengthening the immutable Michigan bond of knowledge and values.. . I am very proud of all the university has accomplished thus far during my term as president and remain excited about what we are currently planning for the years ahead. Thanks to you, U-M is addressing major societal challenges such as poverty, firearm injury prevention, inequality, human health and the climate crisis with interdisciplinary strength. We've enhanced affordability on all of our campuses through the Go Blue Guarantee, expanded the reach of our world-class health care, and set a record for private support of a public university.. . But as long as challenges remain in our society, the University of Michigan's work will remain unfinished. I'm eager to support all of you as you strive to make our world and university a better place. I will speak at greater length about our plans for the next two years on Thursday (Oct. 7) at 8:30 a.m. during the President's University Leadership Address, which will be livestreamed at umich.edu/watch.. .

Since you know it isn't. It feels good to admit it, let's off some steam for the moment.. . If it makes you feel better, I got a 24% in a midterm from my general chem class, pretty damn close to the lowest score for that test (21%). still pulled a B+. To be fair, I got 100% the previous exam, and woulda gotten a fine grade if not from this one test, but I was a freshman and didn't think to study for an exam two days after thanksgiving break :/. Obviously that's on me, but the message to take from this is it is definitely possible to survive. . . As for the mental health, I 100% relate since I felt the same way first semester freshman year. Bit of secret feelings to disclose here, but if it helps you out then it's worthwhile. . . Solo dorm room, cooped myself up out of fear of meeting people under the guise of being afraid of COVID, and I went down the hole of no exercise, only leaving for food and hygiene. The lowest of my low ever, the worst I've ever been physically and mentally. I had a D in math since I didn't feel motivated to work, did decent in all other classes while I fell further behind in math, not feeling able to pull myself back. Dropped it, luckily COVID meant I could be under 12 credits. I felt destroyed; the very class I averaged A in high school now destroyed me in college. Self esteem is down the drain too now. I didn't sleep at night since I was up 3 hours later because of video games with friends in a time zone behind 3 hours. I woke up late, slept through class, didn't eat a lot, and acted like a robot through class. It's a miracle I didn't fail all of them (if I'm to be honest, my grandfather's words of encouragement before passing kept me motivated through the end of the semester for all the classes that were doing okay). I felt like a failure to myself, and to my family, and to the legacy of my last name. If I had to imagine what depression was like, that's what I imagine it was. Never got diagnosed for it so I don't want to assume.. . Only reason I got out of that hellhole of a position was because my understanding pops took me on a road trip home as vacation, as well as therapy from my dogs once I got home (as well as a professional one). Second semester I was absolutely flying since I took classes at home, had all my friends and dogs and life I'm comfortable with. . . ...and now I'm back here. In Ann Arbor for my first semester, the sequel. Sophomore. But I've met people to study with at a minimum, I've found that confidence that carried me through high school, and I feel in control. Not nearly as perfect as it was back home, but i will take it anytime over that single dorm room I was trapped in.. . Mind the rant, I'm feeling kinda better now that I got this out of my system too. Moral of the story, therapy is a life saver. Quite literally. Please, find one you like if you don't know one already. Luckily for me I had a therapist I'd known since elementary school who knew me well and I felt comfortable saying anything to. But even then, it's someone to talk to. Do it, since you'll find yourself saying things you couldn't say to your parents without guilt or embarrassment. . . Edit: looking at comments and seeing people recommend help. Figured I'd do the same.. . Ive seen caps work well for people, but I will NOT forget how discarded i felt when the person on the other side of the screen looked at me with a blank face, nodding, and abruptly recommending websites for online therapists before ending the zoom. Perhaps I didn't know what i was expecting at the time, but it felt like a slap in the face in the moment when I was thinking of ways to avoid a panic attack.

I told myself I'd do better on the next midterm. I didn't. I told myself I could sneak by with a passing grade by crushing the final. I didn't. . . I got an E. That E will follow you around forever and it hurts MUCH worse than a W. It permanently lowered my GPA by ~.2. . . The truth is if you're getting a score that far below the average, you probably don't have the pre-calc fundamentals down well enough to succeed in Calc 1. That's okay! I've been there. I eventually graduated with a dual degree in Econ and Applied Math. I didn't fail 116 because I was dumb. I failed because Michigan Math is brutal and I wasn't ready for that level of rigor. . . Once I had time to get my feet under me and acclimate to the difficulty of college, I was able to succeed, but nothing will ever take away my E. So anyways, **drop the class**, enjoy the extra free time this semester, and sign up for pre-calc next semester. . . Yes, I said pre-calc. Go back and learn the fundamentals, so you can really succeed when you take Calc 1 again. Don't let your ego get in the way on this one.

If you want to declare a minor, you usually will have to take the prerequisite classes beforehand and the you will talk to an advisor of the chosen department to declare your minor (much like declaring a major). The only problem in this case (and I'm very surprised with this) is that apparently the Psych department does not offer a minor program. But since I'm not too sure about this, you should contact them.. However, being in the college of engineering, you do have an ""Intellectual Breadth Requirement"", which are 16 credits outside of engineering or the sciences, and you could very well fulfill a good portion of those with Psych courses. Taking courses outside of engineering as electives is, of course, always an option and even recommended depending on how heavy your schedule is.. .

Art is always a historical dialogue and refusing to engage historical representations will limit your capacity as an artist. The National Theatre of that era has been hugely influential in the way Othello is viewed and adapted - even if the influence is reaction to - and it's important to understand that perspective. But the Laurence Olivier iteration is offensive. It's not just darkened makeup but full-on black face and Olivier's particular interpretation is practically a minstrel show - it is a racist depiction. It was shocking to many even in 1965 and was called out by many contemporary reviewers. The Orson Welles portrayal of Othello would not have gotten this response. But, like I said, if you want to be an artist adapting Othello you really have to engage this offensive depiction, you can't turn away from it. . . My understanding is this film was shown without this context. That Bright Sheng did not offer a discussion and contextual understanding of this depiction.

t1_hgdubvn,2021-10-12 18:24:41,t3_q6nx3i,t3_q6nx3i,"The title of this post and the narrative in this thread are completely blown out of proportion. I want to urge anyone reading my comment to read the article for themselves with fresh eyes before making a judgement on this situation, because OP has pre-framed this story in a very dishonest, hyperbolic, rage-baiting way that's clearly succeeding at controlling the narrative.. . Before I fully give my opinion, I want to point out a few things from the article that are being deliberately omitted from OP's narrative:. . * The professor didn't get ""cancelled"" or fired like many of the comments in this thread suggest. He and the dean of the School of Music made a mutual decision for him to step away from this specific class. He is still teaching private lessons, and will still be teaching another class in winter semester:. . > A University of Michigan music professor **stepped down** from ***one*** **of his classes** earlier this month ... David Gier, dean of the school, notified students in the class in an Oct. 1 email of the move, saying **it was a mutual decision between he and Sheng**.. #. >Sheng will continue to conduct private music lessons and is scheduled to teach his winter semester class, [an SMTD spokeswoman] said.. . * His apology, while not made public in its entirety as far as I'm aware, clearly demonstrates that he doesn't fully understand what he did wrong or why the students were upset by his actions. The only excerpt included in the article seems to suggest that he thinks that having cast Black and Asian people in his operas before exempts him from criticism, despite this having literally nothing to do with the situation:. . > ""At the world premiere of my opera The Silver River in South Carolina in 2000, I casted an African American actress (for the leading role), an Asian female dancer and a white baritone for the three main characters,"" he wrote.. . * Similarly, his attitude coming away from this situation appears more to me like he's failing to hide his bitterness while attempting to conduct damage control, rather than open to understanding what he did wrong. He spends much of his interview with MLive talking about his past experiences in communist China, but is sure to assure everyone that he isn't doing so with the intention of drawing a comparison between Mao Zedong and his own students:. . >""Of course, **facing criticism for my misjudgment as a professor here is nothing like the experience that many Chinese professors faced during the Cultural Revolution**,"" he said. ""**But it feels uncomfortable that we live in an era where people can attempt to destroy the career and reputation of others with public denunciation**."". . >Sheng said he wants to use this incident as a learning experience and not **something that will undermine his ability to teach moving forward.**. . >""I am not too old to learn and this mistake has taught me much,"" he said. ""My passion is to make music and to teach. I believe America is a place where we can work constructively to improve each other's understanding and sensitivity without the need for **public castigation**."". . This all to me doesn't sound like a professor who wants to learn from this situation in order to better serve his students moving forward. It sounds more like a man who feels entitled to his position despite his strange insistence upon comparing his own students to literal violent authoritarians.. . And while I'm here, if anyone has made it this far into my comment, I want to implore you to put yourselves in the shoes of a Black student attending the lecture in question. What message does it send to you that your professor either (a) doesn't know why blackface is taboo, or (b) doesn't feel the need to give anyone a heads up that it's coming? Based on the other comments I'm reading here, I know it's a lot to ask that we engage with ""SJW"" terms like ""normalization,"" but this is the real root of the problem. The purpose and function of a disclaimer going into class materials containing offensive material is to reaffirm that said content is *not* being presented as something which we are to accept as normal in the modern day, but instead an unfortunate stain on an otherwise valuable piece of art history.. . Like it or not, it's important to be mindful of *how* we present less-than-palatable content. Failing to do so runs the risk of sending the wrong message to those who find it deeply disturbing as well as those who see absolutely no issue with the content whatsoever. There's a reason why the alt-right communicates in dog whistles - the deliberate usage of hateful rhetoric and imagery without explicit or obvious endorsement is a tool to budge the needle on the Overton Window. This isn't to say that I believe Sheng is an alt-righter or a racist or a fascist in disguise - but it *is* important that our professors understand what they're presenting to their students as well as how their presentation of the material can send the wrong message, intentionally or not.. . Taking all of this into account, I think it makes perfect sense for him to step away from this class for the remainder of the semester. His students clearly no longer trust his judgement, and he clearly hasn't had enough time to cool off from the situation to truly understand what he did wrong. I hope he comes back in the Winter semester with a better understanding of how he affected his students and what he can do better in the future, because he really does sound like an incredible person with an impressive career and a fascinating history. He has an immense wealth of perspective to share with his students. But his students also have an immense wealth of perspective he would be well-served to learn from too.",-17.0,error,0.0
