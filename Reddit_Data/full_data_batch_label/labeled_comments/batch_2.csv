The school is so inundated with students from wealthy families who have had personal tutors since they were eight that they're really trying to find anyone who isn't cut from that same cloth it seems. . .

""Worst case"" scenario you just didn't really try much and have now been taking the easiest regimen of CC classes possible (which still isn't all that bad). Reading your post back now- it's also a bit of a very lofty claim to open by saying you are a ""3.9 GPA student at CC"" when you're only in your first semester. Like- what do you mean you're a 3.9? You haven't gotten a single transcript, and grades are subject to change over time.. . Other things matter too, like what major you're applying for. Your SAT score also worries me a bit..

What I mean by that is if you had a perfect world and you could go to any college within UofM, then I would say Ross has far better overall recruiting records, especially when in regards to management consulting specifically.. . However, I'm going to guess that going to Ross is no longer really an option for you at this point. IOE is probably the best alternative to Ross, but you won't get the level of favoritism that Ross is shown in recruitment. It also doesn't help that you'll likely have a decently lower GPA as an IOE than in Ross. Additionally, most of the companies that have consulting roles will want to hire you for technical consulting roles as opposed to management consulting positions (almost 99 percent of these roles are really just business consulting positions with a technical scope that are much more functional rather than technical). I got a tech consulting role at a Big 4 Consulting firm; but with that being said, I have met a rather scary amount of IOEs who have a better GPA than me who don't have a job offer or the offers they have are very unimpressive (at least not representative of what you would expect for someone attending a top engineering university in the world). . . Nevertheless, I think in all fairness that your success as an IOE major in terms of job placement will more or less come down to you maintaining a high GPA (if you want to stay in the running for places like BCG, Bain, McK) and having very strong networking/recruiting. If you're not targeting BCG, Bain, McK, then I would say tunnel-visioning on recruiting and networking events even at somewhat of an expense of your GPA is not a bad idea.

Plus, it can really help you take the time to decide if it's a commitment you want to make. Some people also go for research-oriented masters programs in order to boost their chances although that route typically involves paying for the program, and not all programs provide the experience you may want/need. . . Of course, people do get into programs straight out of undergrad but that is typically the exception rather than the rule in my experience. In the last three cohorts of my program including mine, only one person came straight from undergrad.",1.0,positive,0.8215879201889038

t1_ei5j2jk,2019-03-09 18:04:28,t3_az5nog,t3_az5nog,"Hmmm. I felt like I was going to agree with you based on the title- but I have to say I haven't experienced many of the things you have. To go through them:. . 1. I've found many of my GSI's to be great- and if anything, I feel that many of them do a good job at explaining things (particularly in more one-on-one scenarios) because they, like you, have likely just learned that material themselves within the past 5~ years. The generational gap is not there as much. That being said, I've had little if any classes where GSI's are ""thrown into the classroom"" and expected to teach- as you seem to imply. In most of my classes the GSI's will give a guest lecture or two and otherwise work as the grading/email envoy. To that degree, I've had good GSIs and bad GSIs. I've had good professors and bad professors. That's kind of natural to me. . . 2. Very few classes at Umich are ""weeder"" classes (though there's a higher concentration of them around sophomore year)- and most that are, are weeder classes for a good reason. Yes, organic chemistry is hard. But if you're taking it because you're premed- being a doctor is hard. It's an ""elite university"" (tries to be, at least). It's not high school anymore. Many of the classes will cover concepts at the higher end of basically the sum of human knowledge on certain subjects. Not everyone can pass, and sometimes that includes you. It sucks because ""the system"" is designed to weigh GPA as a mark of your potential (so taking risks is disincentiveized), but I haven't found any of the exams I've taken to be ""unfair"" in any way. If you feel that they're asking questions that were never covered in class, that's something to take up with them. Of course- if your professor makes a note that you'll be tested on reading materials assigned but not mentioned in class, well, that sucks, but it's kind of on you. I mean your entire life you've been ""weeded"" to separate the extraordinary students from the rest, because you got into Umich and 96% of other High Schoolers couldent. Eventually, you might get culled. . . 3. I won't cover your part about the thing in the residence hall. I don't know what it's about, and I won't speak ill or make assumptions over something potentially very serious. There's no point in two people engaging in a topic only one knows about. . . 4. As for the ""bureaucratic mess"", I also haven't experienced this personally- though I know others have. So I can't say much here other than the fact that everything in adult life is a bureaucratic mess. . . Finally, I don't think that criticism on this sub is 'always' or even often downvoted. I think that this sub is quite open to meaningful critiques that others, and often myself- offer..",31.0,error,0.0

The initial audition can depend greatly on what instrument you play, some sections are far more competitive than others in terms of talent. I would say that if you are this eager about doing band, you will be just fine.. 2. Making block is challenging but it's different for everyone. Generally it's not expected to make block as a new member, learning our marching style is challenging plus you are going against people who have been doing it for a long time. If you put the work in to making block outside of rehearsal time, you will make block eventually. That said I know people who have marched 4 years and only made 1 or 2 games, and I know people who have marched four years and only missed 1 or 2 games. . 3. A lot. Band week starts two weeks before classes on a Tuesday, and runs pretty much all day every day until the first home game. We rehearse 4:45-6:15pm Monday through Friday. We have off Friday if we don't have a game the next day, and sometimes Friday rehearsals occur in the Big House and will run significantly longer than the normal hour and a half. In addition to rehearsals you have to attend one 30 minute sectional a week which will occur before or after rehearsal depending on your section. Saturdays are all band. A typical game day for a noon game will start with a 7am rehearsal after which you will be obligated to the band until after the game, for a noon game I will usually get back to my house between 4 and 5pm depending on how fast the game goes.. 4. Marching is hard to learn, our Pregame sequence is very physically demanding, and the marching technique we use is very strenuous. It definitely takes time and practice to master but if you put in the effort you can definitely succeed. I would strongly encourage you to run or work out to stay fit if you don't already to help prepare yourself. . 5. Pros: The people are amazing, the shows are usually pretty good, you get to be part of the tradition that is the MMB and Michigan Football. The band is very much a part of the game day experience and you get to make that experience for people. The band is great, I cannot encourage you enough to do it. Cons: It's a lot of time and a lot of work. Band can be tiring, we rehearse everyday, in the rain, snow, cold, doesn't matter, we still have to march. It can be frustrating at times and there will be days that you will wish you were doing something else. In the end though, I cannot stress enough how amazing the band is and how absolutely worth while it is to be a part of the MMB.",3.0,error,0.0

I would say that as long as you practice and come prepared, it should be manageable. Just play what your comfortable with, you don't need to play to impress a lot.. . 2. Again this depends, especially based on which section you are in. For instance, Trumpets put 48/75 people into block, trombones 36/45, which are the ""best"" ratio-wise. Woodwind instruments generally have a harder time. First-years make anywhere from zero to nearly all the games, and it gets progressively better with each year. I personally did not think it was very hard, but don't expect to make a ton of games freshman year.. . 3. 7ish days before school starts of full day rehearsals. 10 hours a week on off weeks (no game), 20 hours a week for home games. More for away games.. . 4. Some people find it real hard, some don't. Almost everyone can pick it up pretty well within the first year though.. . 5. Since you spend welcome week with band all day as noted above, it can be a little hard to make friends with people outside of band. Because of that, I would strongly encourage you to join other clubs and try to be as social as possible since I don't think it's good to only have friends from one group.. . Also, the band can be frustrating at times since managing 400 students is difficult. There will be times when you are frustrated with rehearsal, with the away trips, itinerary, whatever. They try their best and they really do a good job, but managing 400 people is just really hard.. . For pros, it's honestly a great experience. I've made some of my closest friends out of it. The social scene in the band bubble is pretty good. You get free ""vacations"" to the bowls and trips to East Lansing and Columbus. Plus, the feeling of leaving the tunnel for pregame is incredible and is one of the things I miss most from leaving band.. . . Also sidenote, it sounds like you went to the same high school as I did from the way you talk about band. If you did, you should be fine for the audition and marching will take an adjustment, but should come easier to you than others. If you want to confirm same high schools, you can DM me..",2.0,neutral,0.6948164701461792

We still received no response. The building closed at 5PM, and we were told that if we stayed after that we would be arrested for trespassing.

I was in my first semester as a transfer student and went down to the financial aid office to drop Physics 240 (just last semester). Dropping the class meant that I was no longer a full-time student.. . . . At the financial aid office, the person there told me that I wouldn't lose my financial aid from dropping one class and going part-time for the remainder of the semester. If you drop classes frequently, then it becomes an issue. I'd suggest going down to the financial aid office and asking similar questions. It wasn't difficult and took maybe-- 5 minutes to get all the answers that I needed.. . . . Also, I'm not sure if you're a transfer student (I'm assuming you are), but you don't get a W on your transcript if you drop a class in the first semester. It's a special little Easter egg for students.. . . . PS: I hope this helps relieve some of the pressure. I sought all of the possible resources available for Physics 240 and still fell behind. I think it helps to go into the class with friends because I didn't find the SLC groups particularly helpful either (they might help others, but they're useless to me so far).. .

Do you expect the former to be less worrisome than the latter, as if the fourteen girls with party balloons might've instead been gleefully target shooting inside a MH classroom? Are you suggesting that the emergency alert, rather than urging students to ""Run, Hide, Fight"", should instead have been a ""ayy just fyi people heard gunfire in mason so do with that info that you will?"". . You seem to concede that it was reasonable to conclude that something dangerous was going on in MH, enough to justify police response, but you also seem to be arguing that students shouldn't have been alerted to that situation, to avoid ""needless panic."" Had there been a shooting, your approach would've left dozens if not hundreds of people trapped in the immediate vicinity of a close-quarters gunbattle, which is the type of thing that law enforcement typically tries to avoid.. . It's worth noting that, after the initial Emergency Alert, DPSS did issue a follow-up report indicating ""no active threat to the community"" after officers started searching. I heard an officer say that ""We don't need any more units here"" while listening to the scanner. . . Regarding your later point, that gun violence and racially motivated gun violence aren't reasonable fears: you may have a point, in that it's not reasonable for me to go about my day-to-day life terrified of being lynched by an angry Klansman.

In terms of experiences, UM is...really different. In both good and bad ways. The first thing that comes to mind, and that I encourage you enjoy while at GVSU, is that professors are very student-focused. Even in first-year classes, it'll be fairly easy to get to know your professors. UM has a lot less hand-holding, and a much larger small fish/big pond feeling, but the student body in general is a lot more driven.

I also got a 4.0 my first semester at MSU which definitely helped (so if you think you were close and want to transfer after one year, try really hard your first semester). . . Transferring was a bit hard because everyone already had their own friends. Luckily I had quite a few friends from high school and I was able to join their new friend groups and I met tons of people through them, but I can't say I've met too many people outside of them unfortunately. . . As for differences in the schools, the biggest difference is the people. I think the classes, the professors, and the curriculum are all similar. A motivated student can learn a shit ton at any 4 year school. The difference at Michigan was just how motivated all the other students around you are. At MSU, most kids on my floor just chilled for 6+ hours a day. Here, everyone was joining clubs, playing sports, doing activities, studying, and busy like crazy. It's an intimidating but motivating atmosphere. . . If you have any questions feel free to ask.",10.0,neutral,0.4451292157173157

It is incredibly misleading to say to just look at the curves/distributions and think honors is easier when the pool that takes honors is so self selective. Lets be honest, most of the people in Calc 1/2 are pre-med, Ross students, pre-law, etc. whose math skills are generally MUCH lower than the math, physics, and engineering majors who dominate the honors math classes. These people could largely slaughter the curve on the 115/116 exams. Besides, comparing curves between unequal variances is a folly - there is some math/stats for you.. . However, that's not to say you will not do better/get more out of the honors sequences. The smaller classes,more approachable resources, and arguably more intellectually stimulating material could do the trick.. . I think the same applies between 100-level math classes and upper level.

It's also ok not to have close friends at school yet, especially the type you can rely on when you're struggling with your mental health. Those kinds of trusting relationships aren't built quickly. Think about your friends from high school - you didn't build those friendships in a month or maybe even in a year. Your friends at UM are probably struggling with their own internal battles and issues, so if they're not always there for you, it doesn't mean anything about you. It's just the circumstance of being in the real world for the first time. . . Now, about the social anxiety. You have to eat. If sitting in the dining hall is too much you can order To-go meals on the dining hall website or get a note from CAPS or your private therapist to take meals out of the cafeteria to your room. Once you sacrifice your physical health to your mental health, it's a vicious cycle and neither can recover. In the short term, maybe you can use your dining dollars at the dorm stores or use a delivery app to get some big filling food delivered. At least just pop in, grab a bagel and some fruit, then take it back to your room. . . I'm glad your professors have been so understanding. If none of them have mentioned it yet, you can extend your semester and get ""incompletes"" if you're unable to finish your work by the end of the year (usually due to having extended deadlines on things). The grades appear on your transcript with a small ""i"" next to them ( like ""B+i""). You can ask your professors about it. . . You could also ask your professors or GSI/TAs to provide slides from classes you miss or make accommodations for in-class quizzes you miss. You can speak with CAPS about these options. Don't go there for therapy since you already have someone, just go to talk specifically about accommodations for anxiety. Do you think you could reach out to CAPS or go in person?

You'll want to start projects early, mostly so you can get help at office hours if anything weird crops up.

I was Biochemistry and it was definitely very difficult. You have to figure out early what's the best way for you to study and you're going to have to spend nights just memorizing pages of information to regurgitate on an exam. However, professors know that their students are going to apply for medical school, so the curves are usually relatively generous. I've been in a lot of classes where the majority of students will get a B+ or above. And in terms of gap years, it's common to take one but tons of people apply straight out of college. It all depends on how ready you think you are to apply.. . Overall, my experience was that the first two years when I was focused on getting a high GPA were definitely difficult but manageable for the most part.

On niche, we are [23rd overall](https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-michigan---ann-arbor/) and #1 for public. Times we are [28th overall](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-michigan-ann-arbor). Interestingly enough, UC Berkeley is ranked **33rd** by Times' methodology. Here is USWNR's [methodology](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings), it's 1:43 am and I don't want to find the others'.. . Basically, the rankings are skewed to favor small, rich, schools. The following will consider USWNR's ranking system/calculation they so vaguely described on their site (understandable that it is vague). Alumni giving alone is 5%, which I'm sure the Ivies, USC, etc. all beat out Michigan on. Especially considering USWNR most likely does it as donations per head, the small schools win there. Financial resources (per student spending basically) are another 10%, which again benefits the small, rich schools. Also pell grant graduation percentages/comparative percentages are another 5%, which Umich kinda sucks at. Here's some data cause I like data:. . Here are the 4 and 6 year graduation rates for pell grant recipients for three schools (format is 4year/6year):. . - Harvard: 83.59%/96.25%. . - Berkeley: 66.30%/89.13%. . - UMich: 66.00%/86.90%. . Data for people not getting pell grants:. . - Harvard: 87.08%/97.50%. . - Berkeley: 79.42%/92.03%. . - UMich: 80.4%/93.0%. . Differences (comparative data, not sure what USWNR exactly uses, I'm just doing the difference lol):. . - Harvard: 3.49%/1.25%. . - Berkeley: 13.12%/2.9%. . - UMich: 14.4%/6.1% . . Taken from common data sets [Harvard](https://oir.harvard.edu/files/huoir/files/harvard_cds_2017-18.pdf), [UC Berkeley \(2017-2018\)](https://opa.berkeley.edu/campus-data/common-data-set), and ofc [Umich](http://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2017-2018_umaa.pdf). It's pretty consistent across other schools. But that's only 5%.. . Are their rankings perfect? No. How can rankings be perfect? Dunno. Probably would require knowing exactly where students come from and where they end up 5, 10, 15, 30, years after they graduate. Do we want schools that move more people from lower income to middle/upper incomes? Or are we ok with moving lots of people from middle to upper incomes? Sure, one uni spends a lot on its students, but should it? Should a college have a 38 BILLION dollar endowment? Is that a positive? Would it be better to have 1000 schools with 380mil endowments (think wayne state university)?. . If you like thoughts about this, I HIGHLY recommend Malcolm Gladwell's episodes of revisionist history on it, [Food Fight](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/05-food-fight) and [Carlos doesnt Remember](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/04-carlos-doesnt-remember).

Learning linear algebra from Khan Academy, MIT OCW, community college, etc. over the summer could be useful because it would allow you to focus on learning the proofs aspect of the course, but it's not that important because you'll learn along the way.. . My biggest advice for the course is to find a group of students to meet with regularly to work on the problem sets with and make use of office hours. The professors in 217 are generally very helpful and friendly, so the office hours can be quite valuable. One habit I made in the course which helped me was to look over the problem sets early in the week to understand what each question was asking and then going to office hours.

You actually don't have to take Chem 210 if you don't want to. I think Chem 210 is beneficial in helping you understand some of the biochemistry (especially in terms of why some things happen). However, I also don't think it would be impossible for one to do well in it without it. . . You'd have to take BIOLCHEM 415 though in order to do that, as Chem 351 is the biochem for biochem majors (avoid that) and MCDB 310 has an enforced requirement of Chem 210 (and they are very strict on that). . . The difference between MCDB 310 and BIOLCHEM 415 is that MCDB 310 exams are half MC, half SA, and you have the opportunity to get points outside the exam. BIOLCHEM 415 exams are all MC + that's your entire grade. Both have non-cumulative finals now, and the BIOLCHEM 415 is taught by med school professors, so from what I've heard from friends, they do have more of a medical spin on things, which may or may not be more to your liking. If you decided you want to MCDB 310 more, you don't have to take Chem 211, nor would it really help, in my opinion. . . ---. .

I am from California and I have considered UCSD as an option when picking which college I was going to attend, but ultimately decided between Michigan (Engineering) and Illinois (Computer Science, Engineering) and picked Michigan.. . It seems like you're picking between MechE and Aero. You did mention location (weather mainly) as a factor, but the location for Michigan is also an advantage when it comes to recruiting for MechE and Aero: Michigan is right next to the Big 3 automobile manufacturers (GM, Ford, Chrysler) and is naturally a feeder to these companies. Michigan also has very strong connections with other major aerospace corporations in America like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and NASA/JPL, and many Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering students I know from here end up at those places. For Aero and MechE I think it's a no-brainer when it comes to academics, but there are many other factors than just academics.. . If you're looking at Ross, we also have very strong connections with the top investment banks in NYC and Chicago. Again, in terms of location, we have an advantage simply by being closer to the east coast and being in the midwest.. . Socially speaking, at UCSD you reside in 1 of the 6 residential colleges freshman year. The system feels much more rigid than the dorm system at Michigan (it even affects the gen ed requirements you're taking, which is pretty ridiculous tbh). At Michigan, it's a more traditional system, and you get to mingle with more people (unlike from what I've heard at UCSD for freshmen, although YMMV of course). You'll definitely be spending more time with the people from your classes anyway, especially with the many design courses that MechE and Aero students have to take :). . The winters are not as bad as people say (although I've been complaining quite a lot about it recently, mainly because I'll be leaving soon lol). The worst weather is January ~ March, but I believe that Michigan will place a huge upside for you in terms of your career options compared to UCSD.. .

For College of Engineering, I believe you need a 2.0 overall GPA with one calc course, one of chemistry/calc-based physics, and one of the introductory engineering courses (you'll still need to do more calc and physics in the long run). However, I would say for most colleges you want to try to stay above 3.0 for good opportunities in the applicant pool. One aspect I've noticed about a lot of Big 10/Ivy League CS programs as that they use nearly the same textbooks/homework problems, if not similar, and the projects seem to be going over the same concepts, just with different wrappers around them. I don't know about Berkeley, but for the first three courses, the biggest focus here is C++. Although I have yet to take upper level electives, but I believe you can branch out into other languages/topics if you want. Overall, I'd say go with whichever is more cost effective in the long run, especially if you can pay in-state tuition for one. To answer your question about the difficulty of having never programmed before, I think the average experience is the same among a lot of CS programs. Most classes are curved to a B, so if you can keep up with most students, you can maintain a 3.0, which is not bad for jobs imo. It's gonna take a bit more effort than normal to get an A or perform higher for graduate school if that's what you're shooting for.

I think some of these comments are a tad biased so I'll try to give an honest answer.. . Ann Arbor is large and busy compared to most college towns, but It is still a college town, so yes there will ultimately be less to do. LA and Boston definitely have 10x the bars and restaurants Ann Arbor has. However, the bars here are nearly all college age students and theres a good variety of restaurants so you wont get bored. I didn't get tired of the restaurant scene until year 5. The Arb is great for outdoors stuff, but its only realistic to do this stuff for half of the year, I imagine Boston is similar, but from the time I've spent in LA, LA is probably much better in this regard. My friends at USC/UCLA pretty regularly do outdoors stuff, not so much here.. . Someone mentioned safety. Ann Arbor is extremely safe, we have occasional robberies, but mostly non-violent crimes. From my experience I'd guess Boston and Ann Arbor are probably equally safe. For LA it depends: (USC = not that safe) (UCLA = safe).. . Comedy club is fun. Again, im sure not as good as Boston or LA but we regularly have semi popular comedians come through. Very good chance extremely popular comedians will make trips to Detroit, which is about 40 minutes away.. . Ann Arbor definitely lives and breaths UofM. It ultimately comes down to what you want. If you grew up in NYC and cannot do without hundreds of endless things to do Ann Arbor probably isn't for you.

I think it's harder to make friends for sure. By junior year, most people have made a friend group and are likely living with them and all, so it's hard to ""get in"". I didn't really care about this, because I've got a lot of friends back in my hometown and all- but I think people generally adapt pretty well. But you know. You never really do get that whole ""College life in the dorms!! Wooo go blue!!!"" experience. It's sad, but that's the sacrifice we've made. As for the ""lifestyle"", it's not that crazy. Umich is obviously a bit more work than community college- but not to an insane degree or anything. If you have any more specific questions regarding this, please feel free to shoot them my way.. . 2. Well, a lot comes down to money. Know that being poor at Umich is kind of difficult. I'd also say to like.. I hate saying it, because it's so cliche- but in my first year I was really like ""well I'm adjusting and all"" and I didn't do too much outside of school. Which is like? Fuckin fine. Because even though I was a junior by credit, I was effectively a ""freshman of Umich"" and I feel like that's typical and normal. Now that im in my Senior year (my ""Umich sophmore"" year) I'm finding all this cool stuff I wish I had the time to get involved in but can't because I'm going to be leaving in like a month. Which sucks, because in a way it doesn't really feel like your 'fault' when you literally don't get the time to discover things you'd be interested in- and just the act of discovering things is difficult. . . So I dunno. In a lot of ways I still feel like a pariah at Umich. Just who I am as a person, it's more like that community college vibe. But that's fine. That's just who I am.

I know I need to get stuff done, but I can't get myself to do anything.. . Besides that I have struggled with social anxiety. I can barely say a word to anyone. I hardly say anything in class groups or anything, not that I know how to do the assignment at all anyway, so I usually end up doing none of the team homework or in-class assignments or project work or whatever, they probably all hate me for that.

When I took EECS 183 I really pushed myself to complete everything really well, and I thought the teaching was great for that class. After that class, however, I was extremely disappointed. Maybe it's just because I don't like coding that much, and I realized that later, but even when I was trying I felt as if most of the classes catered only to the top ten percent of students and made the rest feel stupid. Rather than teaching you, the classes make you struggle to figure things out on your own with almost no help in overcrowded office hours and tons of trick questions. I got through it, after developing severe depression, anxiety, and imposters syndrome, but I really wish I had considered an alternative like the school of information. The culture in the CS program at Michigan is just overall toxic, and I have since distanced myself from it and felt a lot happier. . .

Computer Science is in an interesting position compared to any other major you could pursue in school, mainly because there's so much out there on the internet already. You could find a tutorial to do anything, and teach yourself to do anything. . . Build a mobile app? Create your own website? Write a Twitter bot? You definitely don't need to go to school to learn any of these things. Computer Science in school isn't meant to teach you how to do these things, but learn the fundamentals to how to be able to learn these things, learn how to think about and approach problems, and then seek out the tools and knowledge to solve those problems. 485 isn't gonna give you a step by step guide to building an Instagram clone, why even take the class if that's what you want out of it.. . I, and I'm sure many other people have felt like classes make you struggle through things on your own, but that's kind of how you have to learn because that's how you're gonna have to do it in industry.. .

There's no way I would have survived 281, 482, 445, or 376 by myself without losing my mind, but there's a lot of great people in the CS department who want to succeed and see their friends succeed as well.. . If you're gonna say the CS program at Michigan is toxic, CS at any top/decent school is going to feel the same way, especially if you're alone.

I know because some people I know ended up getting PhDs in difficult fields, and other people I knew were smarter than the former group didn't fare as well. The difference was 100% about discipline and hard work. Don't even consider high school to be academic life really. Here education until college is oriented towards making students feel good about themselves, so anyone who is a bit smart can get a high GPA. Michigan incoming student GPA is over 3.8 and SAT score is well above 1330. I know you will say that you didn't study for the SAT, but you don't know how much average admitted student studied for their scores. . If all you care about is 4.0 GPA, you can choose less challenging courses and study for requisites and maybe you can achieve that with relative ease, but it would still require disciplined work. If you actually want to challenge yourself, you will have to drop that bs mindset thinking you didn't have to work hard to get 4.0 at high school (and hope that it will extend to Michigan) and study real hard. Purpose of my post is not to discourage or encourage you, but to state the simple truth. . Of course all this aside, I can see a kid's concern in your post, wondering if you're smart enough to become a high achiever at UofM. To that, all I can say is that maybe you are really smart, maybe not so much. Again it will be less dependent on your intelligence and much more dependent on how much work you will put in.

It's recommended that you take 295/296, as 297 is primarily for those who took 217 and found that they liked abstract math later down the line. Since you already are considering an honors math class, I think taking 295 is your best bet. If you don't like it, you can always drop within the first couple of weeks (and, I've heard that dropping down into 185 or 217 or a similar class can be arranged a bit after the add/drop deadline with no penalty). . . .

I don't imagine ners 211 will be that heavy, but a semester with both 216 and 280 at once is no joke. If you wanted to take another eecs class along with those I'd highly recommend eecs 334. Ideally taken after eecs 230 to better understand the concepts but it's not a prerequisite b/c very little of the class is actually spent worrying about the actual E&M of light. The class is mostly geometric and wave optics, with a lot of interesting content about applications & tech within the field. The prof for next semester has been my favorite within EE & really cares that the students learn and understand the content, and the course is a pretty light load. Really can't recommend it enough, but if it doesn't fit in your schedule 414 would likely be doable w/ what you've got. I'm pretty sure 311 lists 216 as an enforced prereq, but either way both 311 & 312 (ESPECIALLY 311) are VERY heavy courses, I'd say the toughest 300-level EE class is b/n 311 & 373. Trying to take either of those w/ 216 & 280 is really inadvisable.

Students studying in the dining room was usually no issue and only really a pain closer to closing time.. . We closed at 8pm, but weren't allowed to kick anyone out until 9pm, even if we were finished closing otherwise. A lot of students would straight up refuse to leave at the end of the night, meaning all of the student workers and the manager had to stay later. If they wouldn't let us take their dishes we had to keep the dish machine running until 9pm, and breaking that down and cleaning it took another 20 minutes. We weren't allowed to start putting chairs up, sweeping, or mopping the dining room until after every guest had left, so that kept the FOH crew late too.. . It sucked because there were plenty of nights where we would finish the majority of our closing duties at 8:15 or 8:30, but because of a couple students not willing to give up their coffee cup or some dish, every closing staff member (15 students and one manager) had to stay an extra hour.

t1_ektatnf,2019-04-13 18:29:38,t3_bct8ke,t3_bct8ke,"Hello! CS Major in Engineering here. I believe you're correct in saying that there's more liberal arts focus in LSA, but that's just the LSA prerequisites. In Engineering, you have to take the intro Physics and Chemistry classes among others. In terms of CS, you really take the same classes between both schools. You will graduate with the same knowledge and be prepared for a job either way. . . I think the main difference for you would be whether you want to do a Spanish major or minor. Doing a Spanish major whilst being in Engineering means that you would have to do the prerequisites for **both** Engineering and LSA. This might cause you to take a little bit longer than 4 years to graduate, but it's not unheard of for people to do. Therefore, if you want to major in Spanish, I recommend applying to LSA. If you only want to minor in Spanish, you can be in Engineering and then you don't have to do all of the LSA prereqs. This is sort of what I'm doing, majoring in CS in Engineering and minoring in Math (through LSA) because otherwise I would've had to graduate in 5 years if I tried to do a Math major.. .

There's a good article in the [nytimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/computer-science-courses-college.html) about the professor shortage in CS. It basically says that from 2013 to 2017, the number of CS students nation-wide doubled while tenure-track faculty only increased by 17%. It has one dean saying that one of the faculty members left for a starting salary offer of ""$1 million to $4 million"". There's not a university on earth that can compete with that. And if they are in it for the research, why not research at a big tech company with unlimited resources? So you're left with Ph.D.'s who are in it because they love specifically academia.. . Basically my point is that I think you're right, I think in a perfect world the University should hire more faculty. But it's really really hard to find qualified candidates to do so and while I hope the university tries their best to fix this, I don't blame them at all for struggling with it.",10.0,neutral,0.761110246181488

You typically pick during the second day of orientation in the afternoon/evening and you actually register them during the last day of orientation.. . 2. The [LSA Course Guide](https://www.lsa.umich.edu/CG/) is where you can look up most of your classes with the exception of some classes like ENGR 100. At least for ENGR 100, your adviser should talk about it and hand some materials out about it.. . 3. To choose between professors, you can use RateMyProfessors or a tool called [ART](https://art.ai.umich.edu) where you can look up courses. ART is typically seen as more useful because more students tend to do course evaluations rather than ranting on RMP.. . 4. To be honest, it depends on how you want to start college and how many credits you come in with. If you have little to no credits coming in, you'll probably want to take 14-16 credits so you can take the courses you want. If you have a lot (I'd say 25+), you can slow down a little and enjoy your first semester.. . 5.

As a freshmen engineer, you will probably want to take ENGR100/101, Calc, Physics/Chem, and a general elective in your first term, which will put you in the realm of 16-17 credits. . . It really depends on what kind of credits (if any) you come in with from AP/IB tests. For example, if you place out of one or more Physics 140, 240, Gen Chem, and Calc I and II, that will get a ton of requirements out of the way, and you can afford to take a light semester to get adjusted to college. If you come in with 0 credits, this might not be advisable since you need to average 16 credits per term to graduate in 8 semesters (doesn't include any potential spring/summer terms), and taking a light courseload freshmen year could mean a heavier courseload in the future. . . There are other things that might affect this as well, such as if you want to take a language or pursue some other kind of minor. Additionally, as a potential CE major, you might have experience programming already, and I would advise asking your advisor at orientation about the EECS 280 Diagnostic, which they probably won't tell you about if you don't ask. Essentially, this lets you skip ENGR101, which is an introductory programming course that all freshman ""have"" to take and covers the basics of C++ and Matlab. The EECS 280 diagnostic will have you implement a few functions, and if you get a high enough score you can skip ENGR101 and take EECS280 (Programming and Data Structures), which is basically 2nd semester of programming at UMich, and is required for most majors that deal with anything software related.",2.0,neutral,0.8535071611404419

I will say though that it's such a big university that there is basically no support unless you specifically ask for it. The administration and overall culture give off the impression that because you got into this school you should be able to deal with your problems by yourself.

t1_el8r4bk,2019-04-19 04:04:04,t1_el8lzph,t3_bei1rb,"1) Since you have taken AP CS A, if you are confident in your Java abilities, that course should teach you sufficiently to understand the concepts needed to do well on the EECS 280 diagnostic, you'd just need to learn the syntax for C++, which is reasonably similar to Java. Skipping ENGR 101 is only worth it if you don't want to wait to get into higher level EECS classes that have EECS 281, the course that follows EECS 280, as a prereq - passing the diagnostic does not give you credit for ENGR101, so you need to replace it with EECS electives later on, and if you think you might want a strong introduction to C++ and MatLab, then ENGR101 is probably worth it, plus you might have an easy time getting a good grade since you have experience with Java!. . 2) I'm assuming you've already checked that your scores on those APs are high enough (note that for Physics C UMich requries 5s). Those APs should get you out of Math 115, Math 116, Physics 140/1, 240/1, and assuming UMich recognizes the transfer credit for wherever you enrolled in Calc 3 and Diffeq (which idk why they wouldn't), Math 215 and 216, which is great since that gets a ton of the general engineering prereqs out of the way. You will still need to take a math placement test at orientation (everyone has to), but you should have no problem passing it so don't worry about it. You will also have to take a chem placement test, and if you don't get any transfer credit for chemistry, will need to take genchem or orgo, which will be 5 credits. But with all these credits you can start working on major-specific courses early! If you have your heart set on CE, you can see the required courses and what order they might fall in here: https://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/undergraduate/ugce/CE_Program_Guide.pdf page 6 has a flow chart, and page 7 has a table showing 8 semesters planned out assuming you come in with no credits.. . 3) Your non-STEM APs might count towards intellectual breadth or free elective requirements, which are ~30 credits depending on your major (for CE its 19). As an engineering student you don't need to take a history or writing course (ENGR 100 includes a ""technical communication"" component where you will need to write things like memos, emails, and presentations that relate to your team's project for the class). Really these electives can be used to take whatever liberal arts/LSA classes you want to, although I think somewhere online there is a list of what specific departments are allowed (most of them are on there). Note that all engineers have to take at least a 3-credit 300-level humanities course, and typically engineers will try to take the ones with the lowest workload/most favorable grade distribution, which you can see on the course profile on ART - these are probably already full, and I'd say you don't need to worry about fulfilling that requirement your first semester. My recommendation is to take a class with a topic that interests you, since you can make an interesting class seem easy, or an easy but boring class seem hard. There are also some cool first year seminars only open to Freshmen you might want to consider. You also should consider taking ECON 101.

Overall, I felt okay for undergrad, miserable for grad school. One thing where EECS at UM especially falls short is the extreme lack of diversity. The male to female ratio is roughly 9:1 for both EE and CS (compared to the College of Engineering overall ratio of 3:1). In EE in particular, it almost feels like you are in a Chinatown because it is also lacking in diversity when it comes to race. You might not notice this as much in your intro EECS classes in undergrad, but you will for upper and grad level EECS classes.. . 3. I wouldn't necessarily choose a different school, although I feel that I maybe would have been happier in a different major.. . 4. Engineering is competitive in general, but most majors in the College of Engineering are not overwhelmingly cutthroat for undergrad. EECS is probably the most competitive of the engineering majors. Grad school is a totally different story. The grad school population is mostly international students from Asia (with some departments being > 80% international), and these people were used to a culture of ""how you rank among your classmates on an exam"" being everything to them. They are competing for work visa sponsorship, hence that is where the cutthroat environment comes from. Since they also tend to come from a culture where they may be expected to spend every waking moment studying (no part time job, no extracurriculars) while in school, GPA often ends up being the only thing that employers have to differentiate applicants within the international pool.. . 5. If you join clubs or make friends with upper class men, you can make some connections that way.. . 6. For EE, you can find a decent amount of people who are friendly and outgoing in the undergrad population. You will have more opportunities to socialize with people in other fields of study. For grad school, it felt extremely isolated. This is because in undergrad, you still have a few (though not many) opportunities to take classes outside of engineering, whereas in grad school, you are expected to take only courses that are relevant to your major. As a result, at the grad school level, you may be exposed to only very antisocial international students, who see you as merely somebody that they need to compete with.",8.0,neutral,0.5986326932907104

Personally, I'm not a premed student (I briefly considered it towards the end of high school, but I couldn't justify sacrificing my 20s personally) , and most of my experience with outcomes is anecdotal, so take what I say with a grain of salt. . . However, for the vast, vast majority of pre-med students, the primary goal is to simply get into an accredited medical school, irregardless of whether it's a ""lower tier school"" (at the end of the day a lower-tier med school still produces certified MDs assuming they pass their boards). . . Fundamentally, med school admissions seem to come down to 2-3 primary things: . . * GPA. * MCAT Score. * Volunteering and/or research experience. . UMich gives you the potential to have more unique/marketable research opportunities and potential hospital shadowing, but I don't think it honestly provides you a significant advantage if you can't get a strong GPA to back it up. . . Furthermore, I looked at your post history. It appears you have a 3.2 at GVSU? Just being blunt, unless you seriously grind and dramatically change your study habits, I don't think doing premed at UMich where averages are set around 2.9-3.2 (keep in mind the student population at UMich is going to be much, much more competitive than basically any other school in Michigan), let alone transferring (I'm pretty sure you would need like at least a 3.5+ to have a good chance at transferring) or getting into med school. . . Additionally, with UMich having extremely rigorous classes -- it will take away time for you to do research and volunteering activities, as well as time to prepare for the MCAT. More over, if you do go to med school, you're already going to take on so much debt from there, why would you take on presumably an unnecessary amount more for premed (unless your family's household income is relatively low [I'd guess like <90k, I would not anticipate much aid from UMich)? . . . I have several friends who did pre-med at various schools in Michigan. Those who went to Wayne and MSU had the best chances of getting into med school (granted they probably could have gone to UMich for undergrad if they really wanted to), because they had higher GPAs (due to less competition) and more time to prepare for the MCAT. . . I'm just one opinion, and if someone else who reads this wants to counter what I said, then feel free to, but based on what I've seen and who I have talked to about it -- going to UMich for premed didn't make rational sense in the majority of cases. With that being said, I would also take what you read on this subreddit (or any other particular university's subreddit) with a grain of salt, as many will irrationally show extremely biased favoritism for their alma mater.",1.0,error,0.0

CCS is a more focused art school, but she's not a one-track kind of person and enjoys the more diverse life at Michigan. At CCS (and I assume other art schools as well) the environment seems to be cutthroat, competitive, and so much rides on your abilities/perceived abilities as an artist. At Michigan, you can join more diverse student orgs or get a second degree and feel like you're more than the contents of your portfolio. As a general proponent of large schools I have to agree with this viewpoint - having 50K classmates beats having 5K imo just for the diversity and incredible opportunity it affords you.. . As a counterpoint, I hear quite a few complaints about Stamps. The underclassman courses are too broad and not deep enough - if you already know you want to do industrial design or UI/UX, you'll likely find the sheer number of other subjects you get into annoying and potentially GPA sucking. Plus sophomore studio is pretty brutal (although I don't know how this compares to other art schools). As a non-Stamps student I can't tell you if this is just a product of Michigan being super competitive in every field or a systemic/cultural problem with Stamps.. . Regarding money, I don't really have an answer for you. I personally think the school you want is worth $40K (assuming you mean $10K/yr), but maybe not $120K (the difference for OOS students).

I'm from Michigan so coming here with in-state tuition was a bit of a no brainier, but I thought pretty hard about it. I made the flight down to Atlanta to see campus and everything. Both are phenomenal schools but even if the prices were the same, I'm really happy with my choice to come here.. . I think the biggest thing about Michigan is culture. As Georgia Tech is an engineering school, I got the feeling that everything about Georgia tech is all school all the time. Stress culture is real, the competitiveness that is the CS internship rat race is no doubt gonna be worse at Georgia Tech. (personally my least favorite part about CS in general). . If you thrive in that hyper competitive environment, and you're that passionate about CS that you want to be immersed in that culture 24/7, Tech is definitely the place for you. But if you're looking for a more well-rounded experience I would say Michigan definitely has the edge. (Especially if you're also interested in something like business or you could see yourself possibly changing majors). . Also with ""threads"" that Georgia Tech has, I really see no difference with the electives we have here, you just have to craft that experience yourself. UI/UX and front end? You got it. Computer systems and back end, for sure. ML, AI, and NLP? There's classes for all of that, you just have to pick and choose. The real specialization and career path decisions is going to come mainly in the form post grad education/industry experience anyways. . Office hour queues can be long sure, but if you start projects early, ask questions early, and make friends to ask questions with later on, you'll be completely fine. . . Scheduling can be tough, sometimes you're not gonna get the class you want, the semester you want, at the time you want but if you want to take something you'll have the ability to take it eventually. You might have to make some sacrifices here or there. I also doubt GT is that much better about scheduling anyways. .
