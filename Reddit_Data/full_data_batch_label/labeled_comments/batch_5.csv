Not trying to antagonize, I'm genuinely curious, because from my perspective (staff member that works closely with students) the culture is one that prioritizes student well-being and works very hard to educate staff and provide them the tools to help support students. . . I won't disagree that CAPS is way way understaffed, I think that's pretty inarguable. And I get how folks might react differently to some of the things that are done as stress relief events (/u/CynicalTwix gave a few examples). But I would disagree pretty strongly that investing in student well being is something that the university only does as an insurance policy against tragedy. At least on the ground level of things, it's something people take very seriously. . . I know this doesn't really impact your experience here but I will say that any issues you feel are present on the U-M campus might be magnified several times over at other institutions that don't have the resources Michigan does. I earned my Master's at another school and the difference in student services/student affairs was one of the most striking things. Same thing happens when I attend national conferences and talk with folks from around the country. In the university's overall budget it is a relatively small piece of the pie, which also makes it something easily thinned at schools that don't have as much to work with. . . Lastly, and this isn't really all that relevant to your other points, but FWIW the number of international students (who pay the same as out-of-state students) has remained pretty much constant relative to the overall increase in undergraduate population in the last five years.

Personally, I'd say don't take EECS 477 unless you enjoyed EECS 376 and MATH 217 (if you decided to take 217), it's more along the lines of a lower workload version of those classes merged into one.

I went in there for the first time Sophomore year for what I suspected was depression and anxiety, and after talking to someone there for 10 minutes, his response was ""have you tried to not feel anxious?"" If you feel like you have a serious problem, I'd definitely recommend seeing a psychiatrist at UHS, they're a LOT more competent and helpful. I was only referred to a psychiatrist at CAPS after I told them I was feeling very suicidal, and my psychiatrist (at UHS) also mentioned that CAPS really isn't equipped to deal with the magnitude of problems some people face here at UofM, and she helped me find some inexpensive, better therapists within walking distance of my house. ""Mental Health Week"" is an utter and complete joke here because CAPS is really incapable of dealing with it here despite it being probably the most popular mental health service on campus. . . That being said, though, I still believe CAPS helped save my life when I attempted suicide, after which my friend forced me to go see the counsellor on duty who then sent me to a psych ward. I feel like the counsellors on duty tend to take you much more seriously, as they're only there for serious mental emergencies. . . UofM can be a really, really hard place to be, especially if you're a student who is having trouble keeping up with the rest of your peers in classes.

CAPS may be less helpful when there is a huge temporary surge in need and you're not high up in the queue. I'm sorry that's what you're feeling Hopefully they still have some usefulness to offer some students. . . I kinda thought CAPS is meant to help students short-term and help them find longer-term solutions via the wider network of counselors, therapists, and doctors within the counseling and medical community (and hopefully within your provider network). I suspect that one of the big reasons CAPS get so slammed with clientele is that those options aren't great. . . Welcome to the national mental health/public policy crisis. It's not a UM problem, it is a United States of America problem. Mental health care resources are not sufficient, and what there is isn't sufficiently accessible, and what's accessible is going to be minimized by your health plan as much as they can get away with. So instead of just helping students get minor things sorted out, CAPS has to help students with substantial undertreated problems, and try to help them navigate their offcampus options -- which thanks to aforementioned national deficiencies in mental health policies, may be lousy. . . BUT OP and others who are feeling under-served by CAPS right now: maybe your options aren't lousy--I hope not. It varies! Try to find out. I know your ideal scenario is to be able to walk into a handy, on-campus, free service that is going to make things better--but when that's not there for you, don't suffer and let it compound if you can help it. I know it's a hassle to negotiate medical care bureaucracy and tough to advocate for yourself when you're down, but this is an area of your life and your own well-being where you really have to! Try to tap into other resources--find out what's covered under your parent's medical plan (if that's how you're insured). My paws are crossed that you have some options so you don't need to keep waiting and feeling worse.. . And FWIW, I am sorry to hear that people feel belittled by the more whimsical ""de-stress"" options around campus. I don't think anyone believes a serious mental health issue will be resolved by petting a dog or drinking herbal tea. But that can be helpful for some people, in the moment, to cope a little better. Maintaining your outlook and optimism can be challenging in college and you have to come at it with a bunch of strategies--not all of it will work for all people. But please do keep taking care of yourself in small ways as well as the big ones. You know what works for you, and you're welcome to roll your eyes at the suggestions that don't apply. They are offered with good intentions. And please know that research keeps uncovering evidence that some of these dumb things actually make a real difference. Who knew?. .

It's on-campus housing and apartments (esp near the diag) that tend to be pretty dilapidated, dirty, and lack basic amenities (no AC is a common one, broken appliances, I lived in a room in undergrad that didn't have proper insulation, etc). Whereas the high rises typically don't have those issues and have all the basics covered. Obviously YMMV, but that's my experience living on campus for 7 years. I lived in pretty shitty on campus housing for 4 of them (3 diff places), and now I live in the foundry and my only issue with it is that I pay way too much for it. Also I Googled it, and foundry has 3.8 stars-- and it's not even really that great IMO. . . The other commentor pointed out the flaw with the reviews thing, but also what's the point of bringing up north campus housing when the OP specifically asked for proximity to the diag? Also landlords for on-campus housing are WAY worse than high rise management. High-rise staff are generally incompetent in my experience, but landlords are more aggressively bad (think stealing your deposit, not sending maintenance for urgent requests, etc.).. . A lot of this is anecdotal but idk, my sense is that this comment is overall pretty off-base. Maybe I agree it feels kinda scammy in the sense that in a vacuum it feels like it's not worth the money, but when you factor in that the cheaper housing on Central tends to suck extremely badly, high rises start to feel worth it comparatively.",8.0,negative,0.8259865641593933

The takeaway here is that the school year used to be LONG. Right now the year is about 140 school days, in the 1940s it was just over 200. Some other things worth noting:. . * Classes didn't start until late September, as a result the first semester didn't end until early/mid February. . * Winter break was a similar length as it is today.. * Because the semesters ran until February there was no break between first and second semester. . * There was just one summer session which ended well before the next semester started.. . I went and found calendars from the decades following to try and figure out when a change was made. It was relatively gradual. In the 1950s there was a slow shift towards an earlier fall start and by the 1960s the fall term ended before Christmas. There was still a much more extensive winter break so the school year didn't end until late May.

I toured Varsity, YOUnion, Foundry, Vic Village, ArborBlu, both Zaragons, and I'm currently staying at Hub Ann Arbor. I'll tell you this: there isn't a significant difference between them all. To be fair, each one has its pros and cons, but Vic Village stood out to me for the following reasons:. . \-The gym was amazing; the only apartment with a gym that had a free barbell (for deadlifts, rows, etc). This was a huge priority for me.. . \-Newest building on campus. They just opened this year.. . \-Rooms and apartments are on the bigger side and they all have connected bathrooms (for reference, at the Hub, only certain rooms are connected to the bathrooms, and you have to pay a premium for them).. . \-Insanely close to the diag. They like to advertise that they are only around 30 steps from the diag, which feels pretty accurate.. . \-Walls seemed to be thicker than those of other apartments when I toured, but don't get me wrong, they are still pretty thin and you'll probably hear your roommates in their rooms and common spaces.. . . . Cons:. . \-Their layouts tend to favor larger groups. Their smallest layout is a 2x2, followed by a 4x4.. . \-Fairly expensive compared to other apartments (you'll be paying around +$100 compared to the same layout in other buildings). . \-Lots of construction going around that area and I assume it'd be loud during weekends from parties and shit. Lots of bars nearby. . . . . Hope this info helps. If anyone has any questions on other apartments, feel free to ask them below. I'll do my best to give whatever info I have. . . . . P.S: I'm currently looking for an apartment mate for the upcoming school term. PM me if you'd be interested in staying at one of the apartments.

Also, unless things have changed, you don't apply to specific majors in CoE or LSA - you apply to the college and then choose sometime after you've started taking courses.. . As for the pre-reqs, LSA requires lots of breadth things like 7 credits (each) of humanities, social, and natural sciences, as well as four years of a language (among other things), whereas CoE requires chemistry, two semesters of physics, four semesters of math (for CS, it's usually Calc 1 - 3 and Linear Algebra), and a few other courses like technical communications.

I was in the same boat as you - I started making Flash games in 7th grade and wanted to further develop my skills by studying CS. My experience at Michigan was more of a hindrance toward that goal than anything else.. . University of Michigan has one game development course (EECS 494.) In that class you spend maybe 3 out of the 16 weeks learning specific skills in Unity - the rest is self-directed, and while you do get really helpful resources, it's nothing beyond what you can get from asking other people online. The same is true for the design aspect. You get to talk about design during the class, but the same resources are available online. If you've already settled on Michigan, it's worth taking the class, but if you're still considering other universities, U-M is a pretty lousy pick for game development alone.. . WolverineSoft, as others have mentioned, is a game dev club. I tried showing up to a few of their meetings but could never bring myself to attend anything other than Game Jams. The club is insular and cliquey, and most of the meetings are the officers talking about different aspects of game dev, fostering very little participation from those in attendance. It never seemed to be a very good use of my time to talk about game making when it was more straightforward to just DO it. While taking 494 I bumped into a handful of other people that had similar experiences; they'd tried to get involved in WolverineSoft, but just didn't find any chemistry there.",2.0,neutral,0.6268337965011597

I think you identify exactly the problems the club has had in the past, and those are also exactly the problems we've been trying to solve so far. Our design talks this semester have been almost wholly centered around discussion and interactivity, and we've organized a pretty neat project initiative for those who want to actually work on games. So far there's been good feedback and I hope we can continue to be more engaging than we were in semesters past.. . On the other hand, you're correct I think. Michigan game development is geared almost exclusively towards bringing beginner developers up from nothing into experience with a very specific engine and then making a project in it. It checks a lot of boxes for industry hot topics but doesn't necessarily *make* you a versatile game dev - that is still something you have to figure out for yourself.. . I think this extends beyond game development, to be frank. Michigan is seriously lacking in a culture of makers and doers creating new projects just because they have a reason to exist. Instead a lot of things are framed as precursors to working in industry or in research. To that end, I think we do a pretty good job in CS in general in giving people a lot of valuable knowledge, but it is still a weakness that we don't have very many individuals flexing their creativity across the board.. . I've been trying to figure out how we can change this. It's a tricky problem to solve - what nebulous actions can you take to change the *culture* of a school? To make people *feel* that chemistry you wanted? I wonder if there's some incentive we can create, some organization we can form, without hampering the individualism we seek.. . To the OP, though, if you see this: if you're strictly looking for a game development school and are certain it's exactly what you want to do in life, UMich is certainly not the top. But, if you are interested in a generalist CS degree and exploring game development as a part of that, it is certainly possible. Despite the concerns I have, I do think this school gives among the most valuable degrees in tech you can find, even beyond some of the #1-ranked schools. If you're interested, there *are* plenty of people here interested in game development, and opportunities to *explore* it. And if you want to truly go deep into the field of game development, while you may not find as much content focused on it - if you *just make something*, then you'll find the experience you seek and I hope we can be a community to support you in doing so whenever you need it.",3.0,error,0.0

The ""nuts and bolts"" of CS ends up diving deep into classifications of problems and quantifying how hard they are to solve, or if they're possible to solve at all. The first few core classes at U-M hold your feet to the fire as far as writing efficient code, but past EECS 281, no one cares how slow or inefficient your program is, no human will ever look at your code, and no one teaches you intuition about design patterns or how to organize a data structure given a problem. Racing to get a passable autograder score often leads to a pitfall where it's in your best interest to work on your spaghetti code rather than rewrite it, so you might never actually take the time to write a program WELL.

It's a tricky problem to solve - what nebulous actions can you take to change the *culture* of a school? To make people *feel* that chemistry you wanted? . . The obvious (and unfortunate) answer is that a small group of people can't change a culture of 13,000 engineering students. It takes a large number of people to produce large-scale results. From a university standpoint, the most effective thing to do would be to start replacing professors that don't have passion or interest (Mudge, Kuipers, Durfee) and replacing them with people that do (DeOrio, Guzdial, Yarger.) But the university is already short-staffed and the bad professors are tenured, so it's pretty clear that's not going to happen.. . On a club-specific level, I think getting people participating is the most important step (which it sounds like you're already doing.) Speaking from personal experience on how a good culture is created, I ended up becoming far, FAR more invested in the Michigan Climbing Club than WolverineSoft during my degree, and a big reason for that was our president during my first year. He was super outgoing, super approachable, consistently put himself on the carpool to drive people out to the climbing gym, and he had excellent endurance so he was always among the first people in and last out. Everybody knew him, everybody liked him, and everyone felt comfortable around him. In my time at Michigan, I never met anyone in WolverineSoft with the same level of charisma.

CNN reported Friday that the FBI is investigating ""a person or people"" who attempted to access the app -- Voatz -- as part of a cybersecurity course at University of Michigan, which is one of a handful of universities with a curriculum focused on election security.. . Mike Stuart, the U.S. attorney for West Virginia, revealed the investigation last Tuesday, saying that during the 2018 election cycle his office was alerted by West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner that there was an ""attempted intrusion by an outside party"" to access the Voatz app. According to state officials and the app's developers, Voatz is designed only to grant ballot access to qualified voters who go through multiple layers of biometric identification, including facial-recognition and fingerprint scanning.. . But according to CNN, Warner's office detected activity from IP addresses associated with the University of Michigan, prompting an investigation.. . ""The Voatz system worked as designed and intended,"" Voatz chief executive Nimit Sawhney told StateScoop last week. ""The attempt was detected, thwarted at the gate and reported to the authorities."". . Voatz has come under widespread scrutiny from the cybersecurity community, especially for encrypting the votes it collects using blockchain technology. A paper last year from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested a moratorium on all forms of internet-based voting. Other than an eight-page white paper published earlier this year, Voatz has been reluctant to have its platform more closely examined, though it does participate in the cybersecurity firm HackerOne's bug bounty program, which offers cash payments to people who identify programming flaws.. .

The ICC co-op housing organization is not directly affiliated with U of M, so you won't find any info about it on U of M's website. The ICC site is [here](https://icc.coop). . . Co-ops are unique in that the house members run the house. They collectively do chores such as cooking, cleaning, officer roles that keep the house functional. Most houses I think require 4 hours of labor per week from each member. . . As far as partying goes, co-opers definitely party but depending on which house you pick, it's easily avoided/isn't a nuisance. Gregory house is a dry house; you can drink and do other substances outside the house but cannot bring them inside the house. . . I'm copy/pasting the below from a previous comment I made regarding other aspects of the co-ops. . . ----------. . As far as getting a spot in a house, it's not really a matter of who you know that lives there. Certain houses fill up fast because they are small and current house members get first chance to sign up for next year. Then I believe members of other houses get a chance to swap houses. Then it's a first come first serve basis for prospective members to sign contracts while there are spaces.. . You can email the house president of the houses you're interested in to schedule a tour. Their email should be posted on ICC website if you look at specific houses. I'm not sure if there's a specific date when they start tours, but you should be able to tour soon. . . As far as what to look for in a tour, I would say get a good look at the state of the kitchen, bathrooms, and living room(s). Those are high traffic areas. Some of the houses are cleaner than others so your tolerance for disorder and uncleanliness will be a factor. Also ask to see a bedroom or two. Most of the rooms will vary in size and design because all the houses are different. . . Co-ops are a great place to meet a diverse group of people and make lifelong friends. Doesn't hurt that they're pretty affordable. They are by no means perfect, but for me it was a wonderful experience. . . Hope that helps!",4.0,positive,0.6352245807647705

Smaller class sizes, less crowded campus, generally lower stress atmosphere, and since they're half-semesters, taking two eight-credit intensive language courses back to back is a full-time schedule. You don't have to worry about dividing your time and attention between the language class and anything else, which in and of itself is great for learning, but especially great for language. Immersion is the easiest way to learn a language, and the pseudo-immersion that comes with taking 20 hours of language class per week and nothing else means that you'll pick up the language much better than you ever could worrying about your calc exams or whatever while doing Spanish homework. Plus, if you take both classes back-to-back, you also won't be at the disadvantage of having to ramp back up on the things you've forgotten since you last took a language class.

Switching from one SSID to another is literally going to do nothing, since it's all the exact same infrastructure. The only difference is the security scheme, but that isn't a bottleneck. The problem is literally congestion of clients, this an industry problem with high number of devices in small locations.. . An WiFi device can only broadcast or listen on each transceiver not both at the same time. So say the access point has 4 transceivers that means at any one point in time it is either listening or broadcasting with 4 devices at a time. Which is only half of the communication stream per device. Now think of the number of devices people carry now. The person next to you has a cellphone, laptop, and tablet all connected to the same access point. Times that by the 50 people around you. Huge bottleneck is created by the access point handling half of a communication stream per device per transceiver.. . You might be thinking well just add more access points, but there is a limit to the number of access points you can put in an area. The reason is you cannot have any device near each other broadcasting on the same channel/frequency at the same time, this is for both clients and access points. If they do, no device listening can make out any data from the signals interfering with each other.. . Well guess what, there are 2 radio bands and multiple channels to save the day right? Sorta, 5Ghz is not very good at long distances, so you need a lot of access points, in an area. This greatly increases cost and has problems like hidden nodes causing congestion. 2.4Ghz is royally fucked nowadays since people have so many Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth uses 2.4Ghz, so it literally has to divide the communication time with 2.4Ghz WiFi. All those airpods and smart watches are carving away the amount of time in a second your device could be either sending data or receiving data.. . Also the worst thing of all is cheap devices, especially from China. Unfortunately there are a lot of devices that students are using that are not FCC certified. Some even have fake FCC logos on them. These devices are incredible leaky and are blasting radio waves that are causing high amounts interference. These devices don't even need to have a WiFi/Bluetooth card to cause interference in the 2.4/5Ghz bands.. . So if there isn't much the school could do to solve the WiFi issues at peak congestion times. They could throw some extra access points in some areas but it wouldn't completely solve the problem. There is a limit to the number of access points and devices you can have in an area before you run out of channels and not have the channels overlap.. . This problem is something the industry is trying to address by moving to higher frequencies, so they can stuff more access points into a smaller area.",12.0,error,0.0

Women were first admitted to U-M in 1870 (Madelon Stockwell was the first) and the Women's League was established in 1896 by female students and wives of faculty members to provide support to the women on campus. This came in many forms ranging from helping students find housing, hosting social events, and setting up a governance structure. . . . In the late 1920s money was raised for the construction of the Michigan League as a women's building on campus and headquarters for league activities. In the 1930s the building and organization were united under the common title of the Michigan League. It wasn't until 1961 that U-M replaced the Dean of Men and Dean of Women offices with the Office of Student Affairs, and then another few years before the activities of the women's and men's leagues were merged under a single student governance and social structure. . . .

I probably spend about $300-350 a month on food (I eat a lot, prefer organic/healthy/etc), which, for about 9 months (as I won't be here over summer) is another $3150.. . Adding in some costs for moving in (like getting some stuff) I would round it to $11500 total for housing. This number is not perfect, but a good idea. Can go cheaper, can go more expensive.. . Overall I gain and lose some things. I did not want to share a room, so the fact I got my own room (in a house with 5 others) is a huge plus. A bit of a walk from campus (10 mins from east hall, 15 from mlb) is a little annoying, but not too bad. As I said, I eat a lot and not having to be restricted to the dining hall hours is fantastic. Bit of a double edged sword, as I find making dinner and stuff a bit time consuming (I really liked the dining hall food...). . I also did not want to have to take the busses, and so a single on north was not an option for me. The cheapest non-north single is $14000 for the semester.. . I'm out of state so it's not like $2500 is a huge difference in the grand financial scheme, but for some people it makes all the difference.. . Just depends on your financial situation and your desires.

Understanding that the BSI program is about the intersection between People and technology allows you to really sell yourself in interviews. This is because a lot of the BSI skills are in high demand, and differentiates you from someone in CS/Stats/Data Science. You'll learn how to communicate and break down complex tech, data and design projects. Which is why the 2nd most pursued job for BSI graduates is consulting.. . I also like the small feel and close knit community of the school. I also enjoy a lot of the course topics. It's also a relatively easy program for having a hefty technical component.. . . **Cons:**. . You can tell the program is new. The school can be stupid unpredictable at times and really screw you over with what classes are offered. All the IA kids are crushed for completing their path rn because none of our path courses were offered in Winter 2019.

I had a shit-tier GPA going in, still got 2 research aid internships, 2 teaching opps, and a really sick internship-turned-school-year job in the department. * Interdisciplinary AF and full of interesting characters. * Largely gender-balanced (rare for a tech-oriented department) and highly inclusive -Easy courses mean more time to invest in personal projects and topics of interest. . Additional cons. . * It definitely feels like there's an academic integrity issue with cheating in 106, 206, 330, 364, anything programming or quantitative, and SI doesn't use MOSS (plagiarism testing software). * Zero coverage of anything to do with programming efficiently, at any level, in any course, so if you want to go into a programming gig rather than consulting you may need to educate yourself beyond the program. * Actually moreso the School of UX, because if you're in IA you might just not get any of your classes offered for a term. * Class conflicts with other SI courses can be restricting AF. * 301 is half focused on game theory when they could have actually covered algorithmic fundamentals to better support students interested in careers closer to software dev or data sci. .

It's a large school, but it's not overwhelming in large part since Ann Arbor is like 60% campus (as opposed to a school right in the heart of Chicago or w/e). It's all so condensed and focused towards the school and all that I find it's actually pretty easy to get involved, since there's so much overlap between people and things in the area.. . . . Freshman year is pretty awkward though for most people. Don't be surprised if you half-assed-edly join some clubs you don't like, hang out with people you woulden't normally want to really be friends with, and in general feel like there's nothing ""there for you"". Almost undoubtedly the second year is where people really find their footing- get to know people around them that they genuinely like, and find out about clubs and orgs in the area they're truly interested in. . . . . It's one of the reasons that I think it's really hard to be a transfer student. I spent my whole Junior year in that 1st year purgatory- except I didn't even get the whole dorm and onboarding experience. To be honest, I hated it. I felt washed out and just completely like an island. It was really only my senior year that I learned to really love my time at UofM.

If you don't have at least a 3.0, it's really hard to get an interview - even with great experience and a great school on your resume. . .

Just because it's my dream doesn't mean I'll get it, and I very well understand that. Especially as a Canadian without American Citizenship. There's a reason why only 3 big-name universities in Canada offer aerospace and those that do highly recommend people to do mechanical.. . . . The area I really want to get into is entrepreneurship. That's something my current university has taught me. In order to get a team, work environment, etc, I need a place with bright engineers with a background in aerospace (I have my minimum viable product already and am trying to gather a team). Because of the lack of ANY aerospace capabilities in significant amounts in my university, my best bet is to transfer into UofM or another similar university.. . . . Yes, I understand the startup failure is about 90%, Aerospace is already monopolized by giant companies, and it will take someone as a genius like Elon Musk to even compete. With Waterloo having the 3rd largest population of students in Silicon Valley for startups, I'm experienced with it. I'm ready to take on the risk because I've dealt with it in the last few startups I was in.. . . . Also, even with a 3.3 GPA (75% here is a 3.5, our grading system isn't as inflated as many in the states), I got interviews with GE for their Canadian aerospace division, GM for aerodynamics QA, and a few others. So I'd disagree with you on how ""rare"" aerospace jobs are. I think you meant it's hard to get into companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc without being a US citizen and amazing at what you do. That, I agree with.. . . . All in all, I'm targetting entrepreneurship, took the necessary steps and procedure, and see UofM as a place to not only gain amazing aerospace knowledge but meet people who can help me with my ambitions.. . . .

In terms of EECS classes, my opinion is 470 > 381 > 427 > 482 in terms of difficulty. But the number of people taking 482 is more than the other three combined. It also depends a bit what you personally find hard. E.g. 470 is tough because you have to design a CPU and then find and fix every single bug. So if you're a perfectionist who likes well-defined design problems, it's actually not that terrible. On the other hand 427 has an ill-defined final project that nobody actually finishes, and the work isn't so much design or debugging as just painstakingly laying out transistors.",13.0,negative,0.5838723182678223

I wouldn't be destroying 6 hours of my schedule to expect that when my folder is **literally** filled with 37 test cases and all bugs in autograder are bring caught. I need help. I need a lightbulb.

No legacy status, my Dad is the only college-educated one in his family and got selected in a diversity lottery to work in Canada, and eventually came to the USA.. . SAT: 1360; ACT:32; Applied to both UofM and Waterloo in High School. . 9th: 2.7. . 10th: 3.0. . 11th: 3.5. . 12th: 3.6. . IB Diploma Recipient; notes: I was a really stupid teen until I realized what I wanted to do in life. Thus, my overall 9-12 GPA was approx 3.2, so UofM saw 3.2 when I applied and Waterloo saw 3.5 (only look at grade 11 marks). Pretty decent difference.. . . . I asked the UofM admission committee why I was rejected from engineering, and they said that I was on the track to acceptance until the computer realized I didn't take 2 years of chemistry in high school. Apparently the grades didn't matter so much as one aerospace professor took a keen interest in my application, which is why they were willing to talk to me. I only took 1 chemistry and 2 years of physics (IB Physics HL). When looking through my Waterloo transcript, and asking other people on Reddit on why I might have gotten in, they pointed to my ""heart and ambition"", as on the AIF I reported my struggles, achievements, etc. Apparently Waterloo really loves people who can express themselves professionally so they can get co-ops\internships and all. I mean, that is why the university exists in the first place.. . . . Everywhere else I applied, I got rejected because of that 2-year chemistry thing. I never knew it was a requirement for most engineering schools until I got these rejections. Hell, I even got rejected from CMU, MSU, Mich Tech for the same reason (alongside some immigration thing as my dad's TN visa was at threat from Trump's new immigration shit). So the only universities that accepted me were Carleton (Canada) and Waterloo. Even Toronto rejected me on the basis of ""no equivalent grade-12 chemistry"" that Ontario students have.. . . . I also think my current condition at UWaterloo may hurt my chances at UofM, here's why. Waterloo doesn't curve and their academic average grade is 75-80%. Also, with a school of so many smart people, I'm about average. I even failed a term because of mental health issues and bullying, and such have a 70% average.

The main reason is that EECS 281 is considered a very important class in applying for internships in software, and if you're interested in the software side of embedded systems I'd still highly recommend the course even though it's not strictly required (it's one of the CE core electives though). Since 281 requires 203 and 280, you'd need both courses out of the way to take it in the fall to have some of that experience ready for interviews and such. It's not a guarantee (nor a strict requirement, people do get internships without 281) but it is a pretty important class in the software sequence. . . Don't neglect your calculus sequence, but I don't expect it'd give you any trouble if you took 116 over the summer, followed by 215 and 216 in your sophomore year (assuming you chose CE. If you chose CS/DS it's even less of a direct concern). I don't think you'll have issues requiring Multivariable/DiffEq until you reach EECS 216 (if you choose the CE route) or upper-level control theory or machine learning classes, and those will likely be junior year concerns anyway, so you'd have plenty of time to catch up on the math. . . Also anecdotal, it's very popular to complete Math 115/116 outside of Michigan over complaints in the instruction. I didn't take them here (AP) so I can only pass second-hand accounts.

Nab a spot via a friend. Also viable through the FB group for parking and housing. Prices will range from $75 to over $100 depending on when you are looking and how desperate you and the seller are.. 3. Purchase a pass through housing or the school. This is foreign territory to me, but it can be relatively cheap in comparison to the monthly fees for private parking spots rented from a landlord or friend/parking plug. AFAIK the main drawback is the distance.. 4. Purchase a parking pass through the city as stated somewhere in the comments. Fairly cheap. A pain in the butt in the winter and if you're commuting, parking will get crowded during exam times and city/university wide-events.. 5. Parking switcheroo and don't pay for parking. If you're really good about it, you can switch your car from each side of the street that are typically labeled M/W/F and T/Th.

I wouldn't read too much into it tho, there are sororities, frats, groups, etc. and groups that have existed for years. Not all roses and sunshine.. 2. Young students are becoming more reserved as the years progress. If everyone stayed off their phones for the entirety of dinner, then I'm sure that more interaction would occur, but this is just squad life. People are learning some interpersonal skills later in life now and it's not your fault. . 3. My best advice is simple. Keep your door open and your room clean. This is not easy for some and requires significant habit change. Invest in a couch and some cool lighting and play chill music. A comforting atmosphere can make you a person people want to be around.

Since I just had ""two years"" of education and my family obviously doesn't make much, UofM spotted my last two years of tuition. I still coulden't fucking afford the place- the cheapest food here is Chipotle, what the fuck? My rent was only like $220/mo in some spider infested apartment, but there's just not a lot of money to spend when you don't have a lot of money, so this was still killing me. . . Anyway, to get to the catch, not all of my credits transferred, which meant I had to take 18 credits a semester, every single semester. It blew. My first year was dreadful, I didn't have time to do cool and college-y, I never got the whole ""experience"". But what the fuck can you do? We don't have the privilege of getting the experience, we're just there so that someday we can have a decent job and make sure we don't have to keep making those sacrifices and that our kids (should we have them) will never have to. . . My second year was better. You slowly accumulate friendships or acquaintances and you slowly find a decent part time job and learn how to tolerate and then enjoy your time. And now I look back on it and I really miss it. I wish I had those first two years. I think about it all the time and I shoulden't- how I can never have that real prototypical experience. You're probably feeling that too when everyone else seems to be having a better, easier time. A lot of people at UofM really don't know how well they have it, they just don't know any other life. . . . . So I mean I dunno man, there's no magic advice and I don't really know you. If you want, you can try to swap to a CC for a year, UofM is generally pretty good at taking people back for those reasons. You might even find out you don't want to keep going there. UofM is great and all if you really want to work for Google or you've always been the star student with a really good linkedin page, but if you just want a good job there are tons of colleges that can do that.

But it's such a niche, there's really only like 3 other programs in the country, that you've gotta accept some things when you go for it as a major. I'll get to that later. . . Curriculum is good, there were some complaints when I graduated but they were in the middle of an overhaul of it so grain of salt. When that overhaul caused some issues, the staff made accommodations and worked through it with us pretty directly. Surprising variety of classes given the size of the department, so you can explore some things that interest you more than others if you want. Some amazing professors, many good-great. Recently heard the one terrible guy left/is leaving so that's a plus. Senior design projects will steal your sleep and sanity but it's an awesome experience that gives you a lot of freedom. You pick your own team and pick a type of ship/vessel and do a complete design. . . Employment resources are awesome. The Quarterdeck Society is the student society for NAME and they host companies or speakers on a near weekly basis. Employers come and interview on campus just looking for NAME kids, etc. If those companies don't interest you, for whatever reason, any other company that hires Naval Architects is probably heavily UM grads. You'll generally interview with someone who is a UM grad. They'll understand what skills you have, what classes you've taken, and how valuable that is. Most of your competition in the employment market is probably the kids in your graduating class. . . Now for the caveats. It's a small department, in a small niche field. You'll be with the same 20 kids in every class from NA270 through graduation. The class above you is everyone's big brother/sister and the class below is your little sibling. This is great, because you build a sense of community. We were very tight knit, and I've got some of my best friends to this day through that. However, if there is someone you don't get along with, you're stuck together. That person who didn't do anything to contribute to a group project and screwed you over? You still see them every day, and probably will have to work with them again in some other class.. . Additionally, there's a small job market. About a third to a half of the class will end up working for the Navy in some form or another, likely around the Washington DC areas. Some will go yachts/cruise ships in Florida, some commercial work. Someone probably to ABS in Houston and some to Oil and Gas industry around the Gulf. The government and contractor jobs with the navy are by far the most stable, but obviously not for everyone. Oil can be great, but it's also cyclical and also some people are opposed to that as well. The other industries are generally a bit harder to get into. . . That said, I interned every summer, and turned down multiple jobs before accepting one before graduation. And my GPA was just under 3.0, I did a few clubs but wasn't an officer.. . Happy to answer any other questions that might be more specific.

Coming from a South Asian American dude, I understand why you feel the way you do -- in that it might be harder to date here in the States as a visible minority. Although how you feel about dating here being difficult is perfectly valid, the thing you have to remember is that **no one** has it 'perfect.' Regardless of our race, ethnicity, height, etc., we can always compare ourselves to other people and argue that we're *undateable*. Yes, it may be harder for you to date in America as a visible minority -- but that doesn't make it impossible.. . There are some things in life we can & cannot change. If there are people who don't want to date you based on your race/ethnicity, that's something you cannot change yourself -- so you shouldn't burden yourself with worrying about that. There are many people out there that do look past race/ethnicity. In those situations, it's your attitude that's going to captivate who you're trying to attract. Your attitude and how your carry yourself is something you **can** change. If you allow yourself to get hopeless and bitter over unfortunate events such as the one you experienced, it will lead you down a dark path and prevent you from realizing that not every girl is going to treat you the way that one did.. . Especially being 5'3, I know my dating prospects are very limited -- and I've learned that from experience too. But, I have gotten around and dated. For a long period of my life, I beat myself up over my height and was depressed about how I was perceived being small & unattractive. I stopped being my cheery self & became really bitter. After reflecting upon it, I told myself the same thing I'm telling you: there are some things in life we can & cannot change. It seems so cliche , but it's true. Reminding myself this here & there keeps me grounded -- b/c yes, I still do get down about my height. But I don't allow factors I can't control to control me the way they used to. Our attitude is what we can control and how we tackle life. I strongly believe that being positive & trying to be a fun guy to hang around has helped me make more friends & create opportunities for me to be *dateable*.. . I hope you know it's not over -- it's NEVER over. There's always a choice, even when it may not feel like it. You have to deal with the cards that you've been dealt. Most of us aren't dealt a perfect hand -- and I'd argue none of us are. It's all about creating the best of the situations we've been presented and creating the best situations for ourselves when we can. Although it's easier said than done, you have the choice to change your attitude and be positive. By projecting a positive energy, you will be able to attract people into your life by showing them that you are a fun guy to hang w/. Good luck!",4.0,error,0.0

NOT TO WORRY. PAPA KEVIN GOT YOU COVERED.. . In my own experience, I've noticed there are three points I have to defend when it comes to my mental health. Physical health, social life, and future prospiects. With one of those things, I'm depressed. With two, I'm neutral. With all three, I'm happy. People might have different ways to defend these three points, these are mine.. . * Physical: This is pretty universal. Eat, sleep, stay in shape, and keep yourself clean. These can vary in difficulty but there are various things you can do to make them easier. For instance, I ate well by keeping a very small supply of frozen pizza, cereal, and mac and cheese. Nearly all the food I ate was stuff I actually cooked. I fried potatoes and eggs for brunch, then came home and fried or baked some chicken thighs and steamed spinach. It's rough when you don't want to get out of bed, but it can also be time you spend not thinking about classwork or people problems, if those are stressing you out. Turn cooking into your zone-out time. Physical fitness is something I did through climbing, and this was easy for me since I always had a certain measure of curiosity about what new routes were available at the gym - I think if I had just been lifting weights I would have gotten bored of it and seen it as too routine to hold my interest. Find something that works for you.. * Social life: This is hard. I didn't find people I really clicked with until my last year or so. There are some obvious first places to look. You can chat with people around the dining hall if you have a meal plan, have a laugh or commiserate with people at office hours, go to some club meetings, etc. If you don't find people you like (or that like you) in these circles, things start to get a bit harder since it requires more conscious intervention on your part. Next steps might be reaching out to people you had a class with a semester ago - people you always wanted to get to know better but for some reason never spent enough time with. Try to give these opportunities one or two chances, but don't try and force anything if there's no chemistry - you'll only frustrate yourself.. * Future prospects: This really varies from person to person, so I'm not sure to what extent what I say will be relevant here. If you can pull passing grades and keep a steady pace toward graduation, that in and of itself will give you a sense of forward momentum. At the very least, put in the minimum of work required to keep moving forward. You'll really end up in a downward spiral if you don't. Outside of that, it's a good idea to keep a part of your attention focused on something you like, especially if you aren't passionate about your major. For me, this was competing in Wolverine Soft's Game Jams twice a semester. Later, I also took on an unofficial (read: illegal) [renovation project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6L5N34MIMw) in one of the dorms. It can really be anything - artistic, athletic, career-oriented, hobby, etc. While not necessary, I think this will be slightly more fulfilling if you pick an activity that you gain mastery in, and that has real-world application. For instance, I've been completely addicted to Terraria this week, but while it's been fun, playing games hasn't left me with the same amount of fulfillment as making them, because I don't feel as though I've been productive. . A pretty big thing I'm leaving out (which will be obvious to anyone reading this) is that depression - whether you're beating it or it's beating you - leans heavily into positive feedback loops. This means if you keep your head above the water long enough, you can build some momentum and maintain some amount of upkeep to prevent yourself from getting worse. It also means that when it rains, it pours. Doing things that make you feel better becomes exponentially harder, but you likely already know this. If self-care becomes hard, focus on some positive habit, no matter how minuscule, and stick to it. If you fail to do it regularly, don't get mad at yourself, just start over. Start small and build from there, and focus on what you're doing right rather than what you're not. This is all pretty generic advice and much easier to listen to than it is to do in practice.. . If you can find resources that are helpful to you (I say 'if' because most people I know don't like CAPS very much) then absolutely take full advantage of them (in my case, it was the first person I ever felt complete intellectual compatibility with, and it was enough for me to jump start that positive feedback loop I was talking about.) When you find something that's helpful, you'll know it when you see it. If you have a tendency to self-sabotage, recognize THAT when you see it and don't push away things that might be helpful to you. If you don't have those resources (and this is a very realistic possibility) you CAN still get back on your feet alone, just be aware you're in for a very tough fight.",37.0,error,0.0

It seems like you're looking for meaningful personal connections, which usually happens with shared interests. Clubs are a good step.. . All in all, people want to be respected. The club experience probably sucked bc the rest of the leadership probably felt disrespected if, as you said, you could have done a better job, then you felt disrespected because others tried to fix what was wrong by taking over your duties. Apologizing to the leader was a good step. It might be worth it to think about who else was affected by your actions, and if there are other people in the club's leadership whose feelings and perspective you could acknowledge.. . Women are just people (people who probably have different life expiriences to you, but people none the less) - treating them like some foreign species or thinking by existing you are owed a date is counterproductive. One of the most universally attractive things is confidence - not asshole self centeredness, but confidence. Where you are happy in your own skin. It's tough to do so when you're judging yourself by the number of friends or hookups you've had - because you're relying on external validation. . . Rather than interrupting girls on the phone, try to do one thing a day you're proud of. Set some new work out goals, and every time you make progress toward it be proud, for example. People are drawn to confidence and-self assuredness (again, confidence is different than being egotistical). . . College is hard - everyone is trying to figure out who they are without having the built-in networks from their hometowns. Try to be kinder to yourself, and empathetic to those around you.

I know I'm a year late on this but it's fucking awesome that you got to transfer into your dream school. Good on you. . . Second, you need to seek help. Try [Ann Arbor Center for the Family](https://annarborcenter.com). They have lots of counselors so if you don't hit it off with your first one you can switch but stay within the practice. You were abused, you're sick, and you need a doctor. It's not shameful. It's your health. I dealt with my trauma at this practice and it helped me. . . Third, on women. We are not prizes. We are people. We also have insecurities and hopes and dreams and stresses and fears that are every bit as real as yours. Everyone is the protagonist in their own story. Everyone is the center of their own universe. . . Looks are only one aspect of attraction and only one foundation for dating. You didn't discuss at all that you want to support someone, have a partner, or share your experiences with a woman. You only talk about sex. Honestly, sex isn't all it's cracked up to be. It's fun, sure, but it's not super important. I was a virgin at your age and I'm a chick. It doesn't matter. . . Please, please don't fall into the incel trap. We're people and we're just like you. There are lonely umich ladies all over asking themselves the exact same questions because they too, are doubting themselves and don't know how to make friends. . . If you want someone to like you, you have to like yourself. So, get health, then make friends, then maybe one of those friends will be attracted to you. ATTRACTION IS MOSTLY PERSONALITY AND CONFIDENCE. Guys focus a lot on looks but I don't give a shit and for many women that's second or third on our priority list. I've dated fit guys, chunky guys, thin guys, sporty guys, nerdy guys, jocky guys, etc of all different backgrounds and colors. I haven't dated any guys who couldn't carry a meaningful conversation with me, hold me when I'm sad, or make me laugh. . . One final thing: you had friends for a long-ass time bc that's what primary school is set up for. **Making friends and forming relationships takes time.** It takes more than a year. I didn't have any close friends until my junior year and I'd already been at umich for two years by then. It took me three years.

It sounds like a myth, but really a lot of work has shown that even taking a single break or two in the day is a lot better.

I think a lot of people treat BCN like ""Hey I want a psych degree, but a lot of people get those and they seem like throwaway degrees and BCN sounds more sciency and Umich-y."". And really, that's kind of what it is.. . . . So I'm going to back up here for a second, because I think it's important to note that at a school like UofM (or other ""higher level"" schools), your degree often isn't necessarily as important as the actual classes you take. A BCN could be essentially a focused, straightforward Psychology degree, it could be more of a Social Science degree that you would focus into Business Marketing (I think a lot of BCN's get into business or consulting), or it could focus on the cognition side of things and go into a health engineering position. And a ton more in between.. . . . So I mean you can spec into more of what you want to do as time goes on, especially in your 3rd and 4th years. In doing so you can get internships in those fields, and those can lead to jobs in those fields. . . . .

As you can see, only 40% continue their education after it- which is quite a lot lower than the general perception that it's just a stepping stone degree (certainly degrees like Public Health are much more ""stepping stone degrees"" than BCN). . . . . So I think it's good if you're interested in psych or would be happy with a job that applies psych fundamentals to other work (like business). It's not an applied field though, so don't expect the returns that a degree in comp sci or nursing might give you.",8.0,neutral,0.6759064197540283

PSYCH 223 is another really fun course which is required for an ENTR minor that you might consider taking. My experience in 411 was fun, but not nearly as exciting. Definitely check out ELP: [https://cfe.umich.edu/elp/](https://cfe.umich.edu/elp/) , I would have joined as a freshman if I had known about it, but now its too late. Also if you come to start a business there is free money available through the Dare to Dream program and Optimize. If you have any other questions just reply or DM me.

People assume you can just show up to class and absorb all the information, which really isn't the case for math. That's why they have the webworks for the reading, so you actually do the reading before class. Take notes too! Then add to it what you miss in class.. . 2. Not understanding the concepts. Calc became sooo much easier when I didn't just memorize formulas. For stuff like solids of revolution in calc II (?), actually understanding how each formula was derived made it so easy to choose the right formula. Same with stuff like divergence/convergence. If you can apply the concepts on the exams but fall short on the computations, that is muchhhhh better than knowing computations but falling short on concepts.. . If you do these things and still struggle, a few more tips:. . Come exam season, grind out practice exams. Ho-ly shit. I ended with a B+ in 115, 116 I pulled an A- out because before each exam I would start doing practice tests a week before the exam and not stop. Literally bang out 1 or 2 a day, even if you're checking the answers after every question or even through the questions, you're still engaging with the material. Then, usually 2-3 days before, I could tell what sections needed some last minute tune ups, and then I used the exam workshop to do like 5-15 really specialized exam questions.. . Go to math lab. I personally didn't feel the need to, but I know people who did and it made a huge difference for them.. . Lastly, the average does end up being a B with usually a pretty uniform distribution.

He was for Medicare-For-All, until he shifted to advocating for ""Medicare-For-All-Who-Want-It"" -- which is essentially a public option. It sounds nice & dandy, until you realize it isn't going to cover millions of Americans who aren't able to afford it. For those who can't afford it and aren't poor enough to qualify for Medicare, they're double-screwed. That's why a Medicare-For-All option is the way to go, because it makes sure everyone is covered. Besides, Medicare-For-All is going to be much much cheaper for almost every American in comparison to the plans they have now -- so I strongly believe they wouldn't mind having no other option, especially if they're all going to be more expensive anyways. This is not even considering how much more efficient our healthcare system as a whole will be, after driving down many of the superfluous costs we have today.. .

However in Hong Kong, from all the videos I've seen, the molotovs are only used to deter. The protesters could've easily been throwing them in the middle of police sieges but they're thrown only between the groups besides when molotovs were thrown at the riot truck sieging the university. As far as the arrows, I've only heard of one office being hit with an arrow in the leg. Regardless I'm not saying the protesters are 100% peaceful. I don't believe as a whole they're violent at all though. While there is conflict on the frontlines, there are thousands more peacefully protesting as well.

Ruthven has long housed a collection of animal specimens but the building used to have some living residents too. The University of Michigan Zoo existed from 1929 to 1962 and was home to a number of animals native to Michigan. This included plenty of smaller woodland critters (foxes, raccoons, otters, etc.) in addition to larger animals like [black bears](https://aadl.org/sites/default/files/photos/N036_0203_003.jpg). Several wolverines lived there included Treppy (in the picture) and Biff, [one of the wolverines that was caged on the sidelines at a football game in 1927](https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2011/06/16/a8003/). Ted Donahue is the person feeding Treppy, he was a U-M student and one of the animal keepers at the zoo.. .

I mean I don't really know many universities that have more accessible mental health services.. . . . The problem is, since CAPS is advertised a lot (since it really is pretty large), a lot of people go to it. Then the fact that it's kind of a pseudo-medical institution and that it can't really just be free psychologists for everyone means waits exist. I think what feels ""off"" about this is that, when you're in this big crisis situation and feeling like the world is falling apart around you, the whole ""mood"" of the desperation where you're like ""I just have to go to CAPS"" feels at odds with the kind of benign bureaucracy of filling out forums and waiting for a bit. . . . . This is good and bad. It's bad because obviously, some people really shoulden't have a wait in some settings. But it can also be good. The range of time that most people feel deeply suicidal or have a ""breakdown"" for is relatively short, and often is at least partly alleviated just by waiting a bit of time. This is really why things like Crisis Text Line function so well. The 'counseling' is okay - sure, but what really helps people is just the *time to decompress* that having this text conversation brings. . . . . The same thing happens in emergency rooms. If you attempt suicide or are strongly considering suicide to the point that you get admitted to the emergency room, a lot of people assume that it'll be this big dramatic event where the doctors have a heartfelt conversation and it's all cinematic and all. But it's not. Most of the time the doctor looks you up, gets some quick history, and calls someone else to talk to you for a bit who probably just refers you to a psychologist. And this feels cruel or uncaring, but it really kind of works. It throws them out of the ""mood"", at least for a little bit, which helps get some time to get real help which often takes months or years.. . . . I've done work for both CTL as well as working in an emergency room, and I can honestly say it's kind of standard procedure.

It's 2019, people from all backgrounds can have shitty takes.. . . . I watched the talk you linked and I'm pretty unconvinced. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the university he gave that talk at is a private Evangelical university, and so likely has a particular political slant. However Jonathan Haidt himself doesn't seem too out there (at least after a few minutes of Googling him).. . I have a bit of a headache, so I'm not going to take the time to write my full thoughts on the talk, but a large portion of it is dedicated to 3 ""bad ideas"" that Haidt believes people have and are setting up gen z (he calls them the iGen) for failure. Briefly, the ideas are ""what doesn't kill you makes you weaker"", ""always trust your feelings"", and ""life is a battle between good and evil people"", and I generally agree that these are bad ideas. Thing is, so does literally everyone else. . . . My main problems with his presentation (and maybe he expands more on this in the book) is that he fails to convincingly demonstrate that these ideas are actually being employed in any real way. Like, he makes a pretty weak reference to an article that one McGill student wrote about the climate around political activism there, but completely fails to demonstrate that (a) this generalizes to literally anywhere else (b) that the ""immaturity"" he identifies in the activists is permanent (he even comments that the author of the article ""matured"" enough to change his views), (c) that the picture the author paints is an accurate one, (d) that this represents a fundamental difference from prior generations, etc. . Basically, he makes a lot of claims that can kinda ""feel"" true, but didn't seem to really back them up particularly well in my opinion.. . > I've used CAPS before and it's apparent kids cannot handle stresses of life as well as older generations. . Citation needed. Haidt tries to make this claim too, citing for example the increases in reported depressive episodes and suicides among adolescents over the past 10 years. There doesn't seem to be a 100% clear reason why this is happening, but that doesn't mean you get to jump to ""it's just cuz they were coddled and don't know how to deal with life"". Maybe the stresses of life have changed. One big factor that experts seem to cite here is social media/cyber bullying which can have a huge impact on teenagers and is an entirely new phenomenon that past generations didn't have to deal with. We have no idea how boomer teens would have handled this.. . Generally though, I think this is a really difficult conversation to have. It's really difficult to meaningfully compare the problems faced by different generations. Millennials inherited the worst economy since the Greatest Generation. A lot of them are saddled with crippling debt and have faced a pretty awful job market. These are stressors that are in some respects unique to them (at least with respect to boomers and gen x), but how do you even go about comparing these to problems faced at different times?. . > I've used CAPS before and it's apparent kids cannot handle stresses of life as well as older generations. . Cool story. I'm sure you got a real in depth psychological analysis of them in the waiting room.. . > Especially when this older generations had much worse problems.. . Citation needed. Although as I mentioned above, this isn't a conversation that I particularly want to get into since comparing problems faced by generations seems nearly impossible.. . > The number of students seeking help at CAPS increases every year.. . You say this like it's necessarily a bad thing, but is it? In and of itself, this isn't a problem. As awareness about mental health grows and the stigma surrounding it lessens, you would expect more and more people to seek treatment. In just the same way, autism rates have gone way up since the 90s. Has something changed that's making more people developed autism? Maybe it's the vaccines!?!?!?!? Are we coddling our children too much and giving them autism? The answer seems to be no; we've just gotten better at diagnosing it and monitoring people for symptoms. While this isn't entirely applicable to mental health, as objective metrics like suicidality are also rising, I don't see enough evidence to suggest that this has anything to do (much less solely to do) with some kind of coddling",15.0,error,0.0

Moreover the types of problems young people today face may just be fundamentally different. This is what makes it so difficult to compare.

This factor alone likely has drastic mental health implications, and from what little I've read, some experts point to things like social media which didn't exist for past generations. . . I'm not comparing the psychological effects of social media to the great depression. I'm not even sure they are meaningfully comparable. trying to compare the problems faced by young people today and trying to make statements like ""who had it worse"" and who ""deserves"" to have mental health problems is so absurdly naive and reductive.. . .

I took AP Psych and AP Biology a few years before this course, so I might be slightly biased, but I thought the lecture material was not difficult, and I did really well in the course going off only Gideon's lectures and lecture recordings. I did an Honors Conversion with him and he was really easy to schedule appointments with. I had no issues with the course -- it's a lecture-style class, so there isn't much space for making new friends or getting buddy-buddy with the professor, but that's just an unavoidable consequence of taking intro-level classes at a university this big, and has very little to do with the prof.

First, I figure out what foods I'll gladly eat regularly, then I determine how many meals those things add up to. There's a lot of things that I buy repeatedly every week.. . . For protein, the only meat that I buy is chicken breasts. I always buy them on sale from aldi, kroger, or meijer. I also buy eggs from meijer (2 packs of 12 can be cheaper than 1 pack of 24). I try to buy meat that's not pre-cooked or offers little payoff (chicken legs have bones). I avoid expensive meats unless I'm really craving it, but that's good for the overshoot budget.. . Either way, I plan based on quantity of meals the desired item offers and quantity of meals in the week (21). . . Here's general idea for someone that wants 3 meals a day (I only eat two and that saves me a lot for snacks):. *1 family sized box of cereal - 3.99 and 7 meals.. *Almond milk - 2.19-2.99.. *Chicken breasts - 6. 75 and 4 meals.. *2 dozen eggs - 3 dollars, go wild.. *Hotdogs - 4 dollars and 4 meals.. *Buns - 3 dollars.. *Fruits (bananas) - 2 dollars.. *Mac and cheese- 2 dollars, 3 meals.. *A pizza - 4 dollars, 3 meals.. *Deli ham - 3-4 dollars, 4 meals.. *Bread - 3 dollars.. *Sides/drinks/etc - 8 dollars. . . . I think the most expensive part is getting spices and toppings. Those will cost a lot, but you need to buy them very infrequently.

t1_f8scicw,2019-11-26 14:03:09,t1_f8rcvz5,t3_dnj4fk,"Took 6-credit last year. The only difference in the two versions of the class is the projects: you implement extra functionality for each of the projects that adds an extra 10-20 hours to each. Bear in mind: this is 482 we're talking about here, so 10-20 hours is honestly a marginal addition. Both students learn the same material in lecture and are tested on the same material in exams, but 6-credit students are at an advantage for having to implement more of it in the projects, which helps you learn it a lot better. The staff also opens extra office hours dedicated to 6-credit students. Overall great class either way, but I'd recommend taking the 6-credit version because you get more out of the class for a very reasonable amount of extra work.",2.0,neutral,0.5362842082977295
