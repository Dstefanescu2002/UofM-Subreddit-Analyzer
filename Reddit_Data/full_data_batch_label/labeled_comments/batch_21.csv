I'm a bio-something major and have taken a fuck ton of bio classes and the majority of the ""pre-med"" classes (even though I'm not pre-med) and I thought biochem was rough comparatively. It took me a lot of effort to do well and didn't ""click"" for me like other bio classes have in the past. . . There's a lot of memorization, the flash card software Anki is great for this. Stick to a schedule, memorize as you go through the course instead of just before the exam. Even with the memorizable information on lock, the concepts can tend to still be heavy. I had to make an effort to stay on top of everything. . . That said, Jayakrishnan Nandakumar is the best MCDB 310 lecturer and I think his MCDB 310 is great. Dr. JK is an amazing lecturer and he genuinely cares about students. Take it with him if you can. Dr. Akey taught with Dr. JK when I took the course -- he's not as good, and it will take a bit more effort to understand concepts with him in my opinion. . .

String Week. Matrix Week. Text Week. Image Week. etc. Each week you talk about. * What are the unique issues we have to deal with for this datatype and how do we compensate for them?. * What can we actually get out of messing with this data?. * How do the algorithms work, that people tend to use on this data?. * People griped that lectures were basically a 3 hour theory conversation/monologue without notebook references,. * This meant when the three homeworks of the semester happened, you had less scaffolding to look back at. * Basically everyone took 670 along side this and got a bit frustrated at the comparative lack of easy reference notebooks to go off of. * That all said, it was the Prof's first time teaching so this might get remedied when he teaches this fall. .

I lived in a double and like others have pointed out, the rooms are TINY. Possibly smaller than those in Markley. The singles are very spacious though. I'm jealous. Newberry is only \~100 girls total with around 30 per floor so you'll get close to most girls on your floor. I lived on 3rd floor Cheever, which was especially tight. The building itself is pretty historic. I believe it's either the oldest or second oldest residential dorm building on campus. You've got cast iron heaters in your room and an antique feel especially with how the common spaces are decorated. The temperatures also vary a ton - it gets hot and dry with these heaters in the winter and there is no AC, which is why I highly recommend bringing fans especially in the beginning of the school year. The bathrooms are meh - sinks and showers could be cleaner. You can also check out the bathtub on the first floor if you're brave. The elevator is dingy as hell so avoid that. There are kitchenettes on every floor, as well as one in the basement, along with a cute gym and the laundry room. I think the infrastructure of the building/rooms are the only cons, although I do think that that is just part of the cute 1890s charm of the building that you've gotta experience.. . You'll have to take a short \~7 minute walk to South Quad (my favorite UMich dining hall hands down) to get food. I recommend getting a minifridge and a microwave in your dorm to keep some stuff to eat, especially when you don't wanna walk outside in the winter often. I spent a lot of time in SQuad because my core friends lived there. In general, A lot of Newberry residents mingle with people at SQuad. You'll probably spend more time there chilling/studying/eating than at Newberry. . . I think the best part about Newberry is LOCATION. You are incredibly close to buildings on central. Roll outta bed in the morning, cross the street, and you're in class. I distinctly remember being able to open my iClicker app and check into my class located in Mason Hall as I napped in bed.. . I'm not gonna lie, when I first got my assignment I wasn't that thrilled because I thought I wouldn't like being in an shoddy all-girls dorm. However, trust me, it grows on you.

If you're unable to take any of those this upcoming fall (note: you would need overrides to take any of these courses this fall), you would have to complete them all of them the next fall semester when they're offered again (and if you miss any then, you'd have to wait another year, but it seems possible to complete them all in one term, granted none conflict with each other. 300 and 310 are geared more toward first-years and 407, 388, 482 more towards second-years, so I'm unsure if these two group of classes will be scheduled to interfere with each other or not, but in theory it's possible to take all of these together in a single fall semester).. . You can definitely take SI 110 and 206 without being in the program, and it's possible to get overrides for other courses, but it's not always guaranteed. I've gotten some overrides in the past, but also have not gotten some; it's up to chance on those.. . Another thing to consider is that you'd be doing a year of SI courses without the guarantee of being in the program. This could be risky if you apply for next year and don't get into the program. I don't say this to scare you, but just to make you aware of the risks of going down the SI route in your current situation. If you get good grades in the pre-req classes and can write good essays, then your application will probably go well, but it all depends.. . I ultimately think it may be beneficial to talk this over with someone from LSA and someone from SI, but these are just the thoughts I had (someone as in an advisor or something).",1.0,neutral,0.8466356992721558

If you get into SI for next year and do the extra year of classes, you could reasonably get 30-32 upper-level credits done during that extra year, so for this upcoming year that you're in LSA, if you can get 13-15 SI upper-level credits done by the end of the year (so like 2 SI courses this Fall and 2 more the following Winter), you may be in good shape.

I assume you've tested out of 183 or something like that?. . One is to wait until sophomore year fall to take 280 and take 281 winter of sophomore year. This is the path many many CS students myself included take. Again this won't set you behind, you'll still have two full years to knock out your upper level electives and assuming you have a full credit load, you'll be in a good spot to register for electives. This would ensure that you take 280/281 back to back with the added bonus of not having to take 203 and 280 concurrently. The challenge here is no eecs progression coding classes first year filling those first 3 semesters with pre reqs/humanities/fun classes. It can certainly be done though. . Another option is to take 280 in the fall, 203 in the winter and 281 in the spring. From what I've heard, spring term 281 is TOUGHHH but if you treat it like a full time job it's manageable. This would put you on the slightly more accelerated path with only a semester between 280 and 281 which shouldn't be a big deal at all. . . Another option is to take 280 in the fall, 203 in the winter and 281 sophomore year fall. This all depends on your confidence in retaining information and your willingness to fill in the gaps as you go. Timing/scheduling wise this probably works the best but in terms of doing well in 281, I would make sure you are doing at least some programming in the winter semester of freshman year or over the summer. Doesn't even have to be c++, just something that keeps your brain engaged in data structures and algorithms. . . Personally if I were in your shoes I would go with option 3 it sounds like you're a pretty motivated person who would be willing to keep up the things you learn in 280 for that 9 month ish gap. Option 2 isn't bad at all either if you are willing to commit to spring 281. It's not a bad way to spend your freshman year summer. Maybe you can also find a study abroad program to fill your summer semester! . . Wouldn't really recommend option 1 because I know you're clamoring to take 280 lmao and waiting a whole year is probably not in the best interests.",4.0,positive,0.7275891304016113

Theoretically, you can get away with super good grades in all the SI ML related courses with zero college math or only one intro statistics course (doesn't mean no math abilities, just able to understand and learn the minimum required math on the spot).

My freshman year, I purchased a coursepack I didn't use and regretted spending the money.. . However, if you're a person who really loves having a hard copy of books, I get that. Instead of going online or to a campus store, I would ask in umich Facebook groups first if anyone is willing to sell to you for cheap.

You also get paid more for internships as compared to research. Depending on your field, you can get paid A LOT more.. . So if you want my advice, try and do both. Start preparing your resume and start cold emailing professors and applying to internships. You're a freshman so it's going to be hard to land an internship so I wouldn't worry about it too much, it's not impossible though.

Sadly, this really is the best way to get in touch with professors, but PLEASE don't spam them. Profs already get enough spam as it is from juniors, seniors, and grad students. If you plan to email a prof, have the courtesy to *really* try to understand their work. If the professor doesn't know you, you'll likely be ask about your experience and what you know. As a freshman, you are likely lacking in both of these. That's when you'll have to compensate by showing you are flexible to learn and that you're a hard worker.. . I'm only a grad student who got tired of research and is now trying to transition theory into industry... so take this advice with a grain of salt. But here are my tips that especially helped during my undergrad years.. . 1. Learn the basics. You are an incoming freshman who, for all professors can tell, don't know the basics. . 2. Learn material on your own time. I don't know about non-engineering majors, but scholar.google.com is your best friend and your UM account gets you access to all the top journals. If you don't have a UM account yet, you'll still have access to many pubic pdfs but with less variety.. 3. When classes start, talk with your professor. Ask questions about *current* class material and try to think ahead. That's the mindset for a good researcher - someone who isn't afraid to ask ""why"" and make logical steps. This won't work at all if you aren't on-top of your course material, so stay focused!. 4. Attend office hours and build a rapport with the professor. Even if they don't remember your name, they'll remember the face of a student who took their learning seriously. Your class professor may not have research assistant openings, but they definitely know someone who does. Congrats, that's how you make connections as a student.. .

I just finished by second year of undergrad and am working in 2 labs with different PIs for the summer:. . 1. You should read a few abstracts of projects/publications a professor has worked on to get an idea of if you are interested in the work. This won't take too long cause an abstract is usually less than a page and it should be helpful for screening out labs that you are NOT interested in, which is actually really important since you don't want a boring job.. 2. If you are interested in their work, you should pick 1 paper and try and read it really well. You won't understand everything and all of the details, but if you get a general sense of the problem they are focusing on, a general idea of what the methods are, and try and understand a little of the conclusion, you should have enough information to craft a few questions.. 3. Once you do this, you want to email to PI, tell them you are interested in their work, and ask to meet with them because you have a few questions on their recent work (choosing a recent paper is generally a good idea) . (Sometimes I send this email before I read a paper of theirs, and if they agree to meet with me, I then read the paper. I do this because if they say they don't have time to meet, it saves me time & can usually get through a paper in a day, but if you think it will take awhile to get through a paper, then maybe read it (o at least skim it) ahead of time so if they do agree to meet you don't need to scramble.. 4. When you I meet with them, I tried to ask them LOTs of questions about their work. A PI at Michigan is one of the best in the world at what they do, and they have committed their lives to it, so they LOVE talking about it. Go with a few good questions, ask them about there work and why they think it is important, definitely ask them for if they can recommend any further reading or other people you should talk too about the subject (it shows real interest).. 5. At the end of the meeting, once they have a sense of you and how interested you are in their work and you understand if the PI does cool things and seems like they'd be a good boss, you can ask if they have an open position in their lab. If they say yes, GREAT! If they say no, you should still ask to meet with them again in a few weeks if the conversation was helpful to ask them more questions.. . This is what I did, and I think it worked really well. I now work in a lab at the hospital (paid) and for a larger lab as a C.S. student (currently unpaid research but the PI pays me for some side work), so I think its a pretty good system. Lastly, when I say 'if you do this enough' that refers to the number of PIs and labs you reach out to. Plan to do this for at least 10-20 PIs if you want to find a cool job. That may sound like a lot, but if you want to be a good researcher, you will spend lots of time reading and talking to other researchers in the future, so its just a jump start on that.

I don't recommend using your nice new ebike in the winter because of this. components simply wont last as long if you expose them to salt. Most cyclist I know who commute through winter use a separate winter bike, usually some cheap 90's mtn bike or something like that. Doesn't have to be a super nice bike but if you can get fenders on it that is a huge plus as the roads are often wet during the winter and you'll get dirty without em. . . 2) clothing and proper layering is essential. The key is to make sure you are slightly cold when you leave the house so that after 5 minutes of riding you don't overheat. if you go to crazy you will simply get sweaty, which will end up making you colder. I usually wear cycling gloves (mine are the type that look like lobster claws), smart wool neck/face cover, hat, wool socks, a thermal under layer top and bottom, a long flannel or sweatshirt, and then a top layer that breaks the wind. I don't recommend wearing a full on winter coat. down side to layering is you might be to warm when you get to campus and need to remove thermal underlayers, etc. . . 3) I'm not sure you would actually want to use an ebike even if the salt wouldn't be hard on it. without exerting effort you might just be cold.",4.0,negative,0.6431052684783936

So now, your argument is that the illegality of physically carrying drugs over the US border as an illegal immigrant and the potential repercussions from the federal government.... is a direct? Analogy? To a public university? That threatened disciplinary actions to a school you go to by choice (by PRIVILEGE)? This is the same as the laws that are actively in place against drugs and illegal immigration? Both made rules on how to deal with people who will not abide by common health.

So, so far into your argument you have done nothing persuasive. . . Alright now you get into the survival rate for our age group.

I was very very fortunate to get a coveted GSI position and most of the comments are accurate. IAs are hourly appointments and do not get tuitions covered. You can be a GSI at 25% (10 hrs/week) or 50% (20 hrs/week): both cover full tuition and 50% has a higher monthly stipend. It also has some solid benefits.. . GSI decisions are made by the department (to my knowledge professors have minimal input) and like others have commented PhDs get priority. A large factor is your grades, and all the courses I have GSI'd for I've gotten near 100%.. . I also can confirm it's a semester-by-semester appointment and you don't find out until about a month before each semester begins. It's tough but it's good to have a backup plan like financial aid.. . Being a GSI has been a wonderful experience and I would recommend it to anyone beyond getting tuition covered.

I didn't know the BSI existed until first semester sophomore year and didn't plan to do the BSI until right before applying. My path was prepharm -> CS -> BSI. You might be able to take EECS 183 to fulfill/waive SI 106 (that's what I did by accident) which counts towards the CS and life science informatics options. Pretty much every major requires STATS 250 so there are a few courses that you can take early on that count towards multiple options.. . Map out the 4 years and see. You can also look into bio minors and stuff for BSI + premed if there's enough overlap with the required premed courses.. . Side note: If you don't already have previous programming experience, going from C++ to Python (even better if you choose the 183 final project that uses Python) is a much easier leap than the other way around so I suggest taking 183 before 106 if you have to take both. .

Tell your parents what you're doing, so they can vouch for your religious beliefs too. Explain to your parents that a fake ID wouldn't work because U-M verifies the lot number and other info you submit for proof of vaccination. (They do).. . The other option is tell your parents okay, get a fake proof of vaccine card, but at the same time really get a vaccine, and use the vaccine info to register with the school. Try and find a J&J single-dose vaccine provider so you'll be fully vaccinated before the end of the month. Two approaches getting vaccinated to reduce the chance your parents would find out about it:. . 1. Give as little information to the vaccine provider as possible, say you don't have a social security number, give a fake address in a nearby town, if they insist on a driver's license cover up the address with tape and write a new fake address, say you don't have insurance. You are relying on them not connecting you to your parents' insurance policy, as they might get wind of the vaccination from the insurance company.. 2. Level with a vaccine provider, explaining how word can't get back to your parents, and ask for their help in recording as little information in their database as possible to reduce the chance of that happening. I mean the worst they'd say is no, and you could try someplace else, and I think a lot of people would be happy to do what they can, within legal boundaries, to help you out. Ask beforehand what information they'll need to enter into the computer, and if it seems like too much, then don't get the vaccine. You might still need to lie that you have no insurance, as some people wouldn't want to commit fraud by entering into the computer that you have no insurance if you really do...or maybe you could ask if you could just pay cash for the vaccine right when you get it, so they'd have no reason to contact your insurer.. . You'd also want to come up with a story explaining to your parents how you found a site that lists real vaccine manufacturer, lot numbers and date ranges they'd have been used, which can be used to fool U-M's vaccine verification system. I don't think that would work, as I'm assuming your name is also in the government records, but your parents don't know that. I'd ask your parents not to tell anyone you faked vaccination, even to close friends/family, and ask them to just say you unfortunately got vaccinated. Explain to your parents that it will keep friends/family from potentially reporting you to U-M. It makes sense, and should keep your parents away from any questions about ""well how did s/he defeat the verification system"" which might blow your cover.. .

Saved on tuition (6 years vs 4), though to be fair I wouldn't have gone for the masters separately (I'm currently enrolled in a PhD program, and most coming in don't have masters degrees). 2. I got a slightly higher salary going in to my first job, due to having 2 degrees.. 3. I graduated with all of my peers in 4 years.. 4. It's kinda cool to graduate with a masters at 21 years old. My family (and recruiters) often gawked about it, but to be fair, people will care profoundly less about this 2-3 years down the road.. . . . Cons:. . 1. A Masters in Math (what I got) is rarely ever useful. I can't think of a single door a masters has opened for me that hasn't already been opened to me from a bachelors.. 2. I was unimaginably burnt out from college. Constantly taking 17-18 credit semesters with 2-3 graduate level math classes each semester was extremely mentally taxing. I barely got through those courses and didn't ""master"" the material, whereas if I just took 1-2 such courses each semester and paced myself, I would have internalized more of it.. 3. I spent so much of my time on schoolwork that I didn't really get a ""normal"" college experience. After my freshman year I rarely went out, and would often pull 2-3 all-nighters a week. I made some great friends in college and still had my fair share of great experiences (often with those pulling all-nighters with me), but I can't help but think my life would be better if I spent 25-50% less time on schoolwork.. . . . The first con and the last couple pros don't really apply to you, but the point is that it may be worth or it may not be.

t1_h7uveye,2021-08-05 21:15:23,t3_oypvmp,t3_oypvmp,"Not a dumb question. Ann Arbor is generally a relatively safe city, including downtown, but crimes happen everywhere, and parking structures can make you more vulnerable to certain crimes. I wouldn't consider parking structures a hot spot, but relative to being out on a sidewalk where people can see you, I'd guess they make you more vulnerable to violent crime. I'd also guess nighttime is riskier than daytime. Parking structures have video surveillance, but there are lots of blind spots, cameras can be blocked, and there are criminals who don't care or are oblivious to cameras.. . Earlier this year someone was knocked out and their car set on fire at a U-M hospital parking structure...unsolved I think, but it was so strange that to me it sounded targeted. A couple years ago a 15-year old was repeatedly stabbed by two other teens in a failed robbery in the underground structure by the library...they were caught; one sentenced to prison, one is awaiting sentencing while in a mental hospital. In 2012 a group of people beat and severely stomped the heads and faces of a pair of people in the Maynard St structure, in front of bystanders...suspects were caught; the conflict stemmed from someone bumping into another person. In 2011 a possible serial rapist attacked some of his seven victims in and next to parking structures (one rape was in an elevator at the Liberty Square structure, another attack was by the Thompson Street structure)...all remain unsolved, and police aren't sure all the attacks were related. A group of four guys assaulted a woman in the Forest Street structure that same year, and two guys assaulted a woman at the same structure in 2009.. . I think that's a reasonably comprehensive list of recent major crimes in our parking structures. (I'm not counting suspected/attempted suicides...there was a spate of parking structure suicides in the mid-2010s, and additional barriers and surveillance has been added).. . Note that there are crimes that occur out in the open, too...three separate women were attacked by an apparent sexual predator downtown or on campus a couple weeks ago, and a suspect was detained, while a fourth woman was hit and called names by what sounds like a mentally ill person the same week. The attacks were unusual, but stuff like that does happen from time to time.. . In general, I'd be especially cautious of men. I realize that's sexist, but I can't remember the last time a woman assaulted anyone in a parking structure in Ann Arbor. I'd also try to avoid being alone at the Maynard and Forest Street structures after about 9pm...they are near bars that are popular with college students, and I'd guess alcohol is a factor in group sexual assaults near them.",12.0,error,0.0

If you want to be fair about comparing a like situation, look at what the University of Michigan did the last time it had an extremely big freshman class and one of the dorms was off-line. I think that might've been fall of 2015. It worked with local landlords to find space, and helped sophomores, juniors, and seniors who had been planning on university housing to find comparable leases. At the end of the day, upperclassmen who accepted their offer got to live in an nearby off-campus apartment for the exact same price they would've paid to live in a dorm room. . . This wasn't that easy to do, Michigan had to look into all of the legal considerations, financial aid considerations, and avoid getting students in any kind of tax trouble for the benefit of the housing subsidy. The University of Michigan had people working on that problem all summer, it was anything but ""indifferent."". . But as someone else said, it's one thing when you have to find housing for several hundreds of people due to unexpected overenrollment. It's not possible to do those same measures when you have a substantial number of last year's class who want to live on campus by choice and you don't have the space. It's completely understandable that last year's class, who had such a strange housing experience (if they even had a housing experience at all) would want a do-over.

Busses run regularly and you can usually get from the main bus stop on North Campus to the main bus stop on Central Campus within 10-20 minutes.. 2. **What is your favorite part about Michigan?**. 1. A bunch of opportunities from clubs to research to recruiting. Lot of people so you should be able to find your community no matter what.. 2.

Because I went to Michigan, I know a lot of the bad things about Michigan. I'm sure other schools have similar problems and these aren't unique to Michigan. . 1. A lot of the students here come from money. Median family income was 150k a few years ago across all majors. In the business school, median family income is around 250k. I think this causes an environment where not all students or faculty have the perspective needed to empathize with all of the students at the university. . 2. There is a difference in underclassmen, upperclassmen, and engineering tuition. This was a shock to me as I just looked up cost of attendance when making my pro con list of each college during my decision process.. 3.

Currently live in a city twice the size and it feels the exact same. . 5. **Anything I need to know about Michigan that I wouldn't think about in the application process?**. 1.

As a society we accept that the world is not perfect, and that accidents will happen even if everyone on the road is trained and certified. We're willing to add some mobility restrictions (and admittedly an economic burden in case of the insurance) in response to this imperfect reality, and legislate accordingly.

The University of Michigan will be fully vaccinated this fall, therefore, COVID should be treated as one of the many risks we take each day. The rest of country would do better to mandate vaccines than prolong the pandemic with restrictions. . . I wasn't really looking to get into a discussion on policy, my only reason for the reply above was to explain the dudes analogy and why your approach didn't fit. However, I'm going to respond to your point anyways.. . Given that the Coronavirus is going to be endemic, the timescale of precautions is entirely relevant. We will continue to have variants for years to come; even if everyone in America gets double-vaccinated, populations in other countries will ensure the virus will have a home to reproduce and mutate. . . Just because breakthrough cases occur doesn't mean the vaccines have stopped working. Restarting restrictions and developing a new booster for every relevant variant that comes up as a response is socially and economically unsustainable. The point is, we're not trying to completely eliminate the Coronavirus, we're trying to turn it into the common cold. If you're vaccinated, the chances of catching COVID are lower than if you're unvaccinated, the chances of hospitalization are immensely lower than if you're unvaccinated, and the chances of death are so much lower than if you're unvaccinated that its tantamount to a statistical anomaly, even with delta. That's the kind of background risk we all take every day regardless of the virus. . . What I'm saying here is that the vaccines are doing their jobs: if you're fully vaccinated, then COVID is just another common cold to deal with, which is why I think the best thing for society as a whole to do to get us out of this mess as fast as possible is to mandate the vaccines. And look at that, the University has already done that, which is why I don't support this specific mask mandate. It's reactionary BS for an issue that we've already solved. The only possible reason that it could be justified in my eyes is to protect unvaccinated children, but the virus is already way less deadly in children anyways, and as I said, the spread will be much slower in a fully vaccinated population. . . For students in Ann Arbor, requiring masks in classrooms only is just public health theater. In the rest of the country, requiring masks at this point is just prolonging the pandemic at the expense of the responsible vaccinated.",3.0,error,0.0

t1_h8m34qj,2021-08-12 03:39:43,t3_p2lpd1,t3_p2lpd1,"Absolutely start the projects early. I know every programming class says this, but you will absolutely hate yourself if you don't start early. . . One of the differences I found between 482 and other coding classes is that the projects are hard in a different way. I found other programming class projects boiled down to just throwing more hours at the project working on code until it was complete, but for 482, the code generally isn't difficult, rather it's the conceptual planning that is difficult. The projects have large ideas that take time to wrap your head around and plan on how to do everything. Most of the projects you will spend a majority of the time planning. You can't just throw more hours into ""just coding"" a project because if you planned your project long or didn't account for a particular implementation case, all your previous code could be useless and require you to rewrite large portions of code or otherwise just take the L on missing points.. . That being said, I'd highly recommend to read the spec, sketch out your projects organization (methods, data structures, algorithm procedure) literally on paper, re read the spec, sketch out everything again, discuss it with your partner, and then go to office hours to review your approach to the project. Go to OH early in the project cycle (when it's easier on the instructors to sit with you for a while), and actively work with the instructor to ask questions about implementations issues, approaches, potential problems, etc. Do not go to OH and ask them to review your plan and sit back, instead walk them through your approach and your reasoning for it (you want to respect their aid and show that you are working on the problem, not asking them for the solution).. . Also, stay on top of lectures, if you get behind it is hell to catch up for the projects and exams.. . I found the exams to be difficult because they throw a lot at you with not a lot of time. My best advice for the exams is to really understand what the question is asking you to do (I.e. kernel code vs application code) and write down as much as you can for your approach in every question (within reason) so that you can leave plenty for graders to give you partial credit for attempting problems.. .

I know there are plenty of horror stories out there, but it's definitely worth it if you're willing to put in the time and effort to complete the course. . . The biggest piece of advice like everyone else said, is to **start projects early and have good and reliable teammates**!. . I'd argue the best way to initially set yourself up for success in 482 is to find individuals who are willing to work as much if not more than you are and motivate you to keep going. There will likely be points where you feel so stuck or like you have no idea what you're doing, but that's why it's so important to have people to help take you out of that slump and get you back on track.. . As far as the projects go, try to come up with as thorough of a design as you can (document your thoughts and potential design patterns) before you start coding, and get it reviewed in office hours if possible. I'm not sure how office hours will work now that things are back in person, but when things were online, my team was usually waiting anywhere between 1-3 hours in the OH queue. When the projects are first assigned, OH wait times will be short compared to when the project deadlines are nearing. Take advantage of the early access to the course staff (482 had the best EECS course staff I've worked with by far). They are always looking for ways they can help you without giving you the answers.. . For locating bugs in projects, the first thing anyone will tell you is to write good test cases. In other classes you can probably get away writing decent test cases, but 482 will really require you to write test cases that well, cover every case. You will come across concepts like non-determinism, in which your program will potentially behave differently each time you run it. If your test suite is not comprehensive enough, you might fail to catch a non-deterministic issue and you'll be left wondering why you're failing lots of cases on the autograder. It might also be useful to use different command line tools available like gcov, perf, gdb, etc.. but test cases would be the best way to go to pinpoint specific issues.. . Something a lot of people overlook in 482 is the exams, because we spend so much time on projects. The exams are pretty difficult. Keeping up with lectures and asking clarifying questions in office hours will be your friend in getting good scores on the exams.. .

The student body can depend - I've met many other queer peers here at UMSI and feel very happy here, but I know student bodies in other departments/clubs/spaces/etc aren't always as inclusive. . . U-M has an preferred name system that's easy to set up and reflects across most student account info (you can have it printed on your MCard too!). That said, I've had a few friends struggle to have their preferred name written on their diploma (idk if that's a department-specific issue or not though). Def speak with student services or the Spectrum Center about this if it's of concern to you. . . And just a note on trans inclusiveness in Michigan cuz you're from OOS: it depends heavily on the region. Areas like Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti (especially Ypsi, huge trans community there) lean more inclusive of trans folks. But places like west/central Michigan, northern Michigan, the UP, or any generally rural area can be dicey. Southeast Michigan is generally good though, and there's a lot of trans support groups in the area where you can meet others, learn about the resources available to you, etc. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your time here :). . Edit: additionally, the UHS has a trans healthcare team that specializes in HRT-related stuff, and you can see them right on campus if you aren't seeing another doctor elsewhere. Be advised, however, that the UHS pharmacists aren't always trans friendly.

Either past assignments, or dream up something like a simple phone directory or shopping list program...write it using an array, then write a second version that uses a linked list. Think of some simple features to add, like deleting entries, searching, or sorting. It'll help dust off some mental cobwebs, about the programming language, about the tools you use (editor, interpreter/compiler, debugger), and about data structures and methods that you'll undoubtedly use in future programs.. .

t1_h8r0dsq,2021-08-13 05:17:47,t3_p37afm,t3_p37afm,"Hello! Former IA and graduate here :). . Don't stress yourself out by reviewing old material or going through lecture notes. You won't retain it and to be honest it's not that useful! 281 is difficult, but here's a few tips that will hopefully make your life easier.. . 1. Start the project early. I know I know, everyone says this and it sounds annoying and this is super generic advice for literally every assignment. But seriously, start it early. Day 1. And I don't mean you need to try to finish the whole thing. The key to getting projects done is by doing it one function at a time, so just take it slow. Start by reading the spec (Don't skim it, duh), and then start one step at a time. 281 is different from 280 in that you start to have a lot more independence in what you can write, and there's not as much pre-written for you. That's ok! Just break it down into chunks and tackle one chunk at a time. You can do it!. . 2. You can pass the class by acing the projects and ""failing"" the exams. Is this a bad life tip? I don't know, but just focus on the projects. Furthermore, the more you understand the project, the better you'll do on the exam. (482 is the best example of this in terms of ULCS). . 3. The people who are most successful in CS are the people that enjoy doing it. Someone else in the comments mentioned this, but really try to think back to why you're taking a CS class in the first place. It's kinda fun right? And you can do anything, it's literally the same as painting. It's the most creative STEM class that exists! So please, in your spare time, challenge yourself to think of a few small ideas for cool programs, and spend time after class building them. That is seriously the best way to learn and get confidence in CS, more than anything else. For example, after taking 183 I tried to make chess in c++, and then I even tried to make my own (small, ascii/terminal) game as well. Those were the best projects I did and really set me up for success in 280 (and beyond) because I had to research and learn a lot of concepts on my own to do what I wanted. It doesn't have to be crazy, It just has to be fun!. . Last but not least, take care of yourself. You've made it this far, so really I have full confidence you can do anything. You don't need A's to get a great career, you just need to enjoy the work and share that love and passion with others. Recruiters / hiring managers like charisma and communication skills a lot more these days, and there's no better way to have that than to love what you're doing and have the want to talk about it. Don't burn yourself out by trying to be the best, that will really come naturally if you focus more time on practicing the parts you love about it and gaining independent growth there.. . Feel free to dm me for any more advice! Good luck!. . Quick edit because I forgot:. . If it gets tough and you really start to sweat, just reach out to me or someone else. But please, for the love of god, do not try to use someone else's code (or try to shape it into your own). You will get caught, and no matter how much someone tries to convince you, you won't be able to pull it off. Same goes for showing someone else your code. Just forget about it. It's so not worth the risk, and if you get caught your entire future in CS will be up in smoke, and you won't get a second chance. I repeat, you will not get a second chance.",8.0,error,0.0

It's huge to start early and have a set plan when it comes to these projects. Utilizing office hours can help you get a solid plan so you don't waste time on an idea that won't be fast enough or takes up too much memory.. . Secondary tip: This might sound strange, but you may consider writing sudo code before you actually start any real code.

On the one hand, areas with high vaccination rates are doing quite well in keeping the spread low. On the other, the delta variant is doing a number on areas with low vaccination rates. The University instituted the vaccine mandate and the results have been extremely encouraging. However, over the next few weeks, many thousands of people from all over the world (and across the spectrum of vaccination rates) will be coming to campus. A small portion of them won't be vaccinated. A small portion of them may be vaccinated, but asymptomatic carriers. Breakthrough cases are potentially more likely with the delta variant. So what does this all mean? Nobody knows, we have to wait and see. So they've decided to issue a mask mandate for the time being and continue to closely track daily cases. We'll have a much better sense of the situation a few weeks into the semester. If there's been minimal spread after those few weeks, I wouldn't be surprised to see the mandate lifted.

Students, especially first years, are afraid of asking questions to their profs. Everyone's biggest fear here is looking stupid. Try to decrease this effect by explicitly welcoming questions and **lowering the bar for participation**. What this means is, if no one's offering a solution to the problem you posed (because they're afraid to be wrong), lower the bar and ask for an idea of where to start. Just basic encouragement (like ""it's ok if your answer is wrong, I want wrong answers"") go a long way. Reward wrong answers by responding positively.. . . 2) Good teaching is 25% preparation and 75% theatre. Preparation is key; nothing's worse than stumbling through a lab or freezing up on a proof (I've done both). ""Theatre"" means don't be boring. Engage the class with questions. Use and project your voice in an attention grabbing way. An anecdote here and there goes a long way. Try to be a fun person to watch/listen to, or at least not a boring one.. . . 3) Teaching first years is an especially important role because you're forming their first impressions of both university and the field you're teaching. Try to be an inspiration and to be sociable, not just a cog mechanically doing its job. I find anecdotes to be effective for this. . . . . **Office Hours**:. . 3) I go for a Socratic approach. Help your student with their confusion by asking them guiding questions. I see a lot of IAs just jump into explaining the problem, which I don't like because you don't really know the level the student is at if you don't interrogate them first. You might be boring them, or going right over their head.. . . 4) Be **very** careful about just giving them the answers. It can be ***extremely*** tempting; it is after all the easiest thing to do. Furthermore, it's natural to sympathize with a frustrated student who's just not getting it. You want to help them more and more till you just give them the answer. Also, students will get frustrated with *you* if you withhold from them; this has no effect on grizzled profs, but for a rookie IA that just wants the students to like them, it's a powerful temptation to just give them what they want. But doing so would only undermine their own learning. Students get nothing from just hearing the solutions. Learning only happens when they get to the answer themselves. So you really need to put their learning ahead of your desire to be liked for them. The reason I spend so much time on this point is that many fellow IAs fall for this, and I felt the temptation too.. . . 4.5) You'll also be tempted to just give the solution if your own understanding is shoddy. You need to have a really good grasp of a problem to give helpful advice that doesn't give the solution away. But a 6 year old could just repeat the solution to the student, it's trivial. I've sometimes found myself edging on giving away the solution because I didn't prepare enough to understand the problem, so I had no other way to help the student. Avoid this by preparing!. . . . 5) Don't be afraid to send students off to go apply your advice while you go help the next student. ENGR 100 is a huuuge course, so you need to keep the queue moving. Students often never want to leave office hours, there are some that'll take every minute you give them. I see a lot of rookie IAs hesitant to ending the session and literally end up spending upwards of 30 minutes on a single student. . . . .

They also are both sometimes classifiable as ""repertoire theaters"" which means they show films that are programmed by curators and usually are selected from various classic cannons- so you might catch a ""genre film"" (e.g. horror, sci fi, fantasy, and other historically ""lower brow"" categories) at the state and a classic Bergman at the Michigan, but you might also catch Apichatpong Weerasethakul's latest feature fresh out of winning the jury prize at Cannes, or a special program of experimental films from the Ann Arbor Film Festival that you will likely never be able to see again in your life at either of these theaters. Nowadays they both live under the Michigan theater's non profit organization, so the differences are less pronounced than they used to be, but historically the state would be the place you'd catch the ""just for fun""/genre films, and the Michigan was were you'd to to get your international film festival highlights and of course see the nation's longest running independent experimental film festival, AAFF. I do think you're still more likely to catch more mainstream films at the state but I think times being what they are, the Michigan is probably not turning down opportunities to get more people in the door so, I'd bet either will be showing more ""regular"" films as well, it's just all of the film distribution plans (of both indie and Hollywood features) are just so absolutely fucked up right now it might look a bit more ""repertoire"" than it usually is on any given week.. . If you're a FTVM major, both will be your new fave venues; if you're a burgeoning film fan, they're both perfect venues to expand your filmic horizons. I can't recommend them both enough.. . If you're only looking for a more ""stuff you might catch at your local mall"" fare and the accompanying vibes, I believe the (formerly showcase Cinema, currently Cinemark-owned) Ann Arbor 20 Imax off of Carpenter is gonna be a more reliably multiplex-y bet. although the Michigan has to make money so it's not like they never show Hollywood fare, it's just more likely to also be indie-Hollywood fare.. .

So, if we followed Admin's proposal of 10.6% spread out over 3 years (the life of the contract) the medians would be more like 70K for Ann Arbor, and 50K for Dearborn & Flint lecturers.

There's actually people who believe McCain cost Palin the election, not the other way around. McCain voted for NAFTA, Iraq War, and the Comprehensive immigration plan that would have incentivized further illegal immigration, not very popular amongst Republicans. McCain voted with the democrats too often and thus gave off weak establishment vibes.

Since then his ever so popular partisan family has been censured by the the AZ GOP. They don't even recognize his wife as a Republican any more. . . Trump on the other hand wasn't entrenched within the Washington establishment. He said what he was going to do and promptly did it, and he didn't let Washington dictate the terms and conditions along the way. Trump only won 3mil more votes than McCain did in 2016 which makes a lot of sense considering the media had a bitter stranglehold on the flow of information. Trump then had no space to prove that he was going to do what he said he was going to do. But as the years went on it became clear that he was capable of following through on promises, which most politicians in the last 75 years failed to do, even in two terms. Tax cuts that actually worked at soaring wages (wages in 2019 rose more than all the Obama years), his energy policy reduced costs across the board making many goods affordable again. Isis obliterated in 3 months, peace with Israel and Morocco, UAB, and Jordan first time in 60 years Israel and Arab nations formed diplomatic ties. Most politicians had about as much luck in the Middle East as Biden is right now with the Taliban seizing US assets and using them against Afghani people. First step act, Criminal justice reform, vaccine in 9 months, jobs returning to US, USMCA. These were landmark deals made that were extremely popular. Everywhere Trump went he drew hundreds of thousands of people, and especially on his Pennsylvania blitz Saturday where he went to all four corners of the state and drew 100,000+ people at each event. Many of whom couldn't even get in. It was clear that Trump was far more popular than any other republican, especially since he catered to the people who were systematically left behind by the Washington establishment where McCain was beltway first. Before Trump was even president he negotiated a deal with Carrier to keep them in Indiana. USMCA increased the requirements for qualifying a product as US made, which kept more jobs in the states. During the pandemic, Trump did not turn his back on the people. He performed 13 straight days worth of press conferences were he set the record straight while taking on the most vile media cabal in history which was doing everything in their power to pin the virus on him. Now we see that's total crap because the virus came from a Chinese lab, and Trump was to only one brave enough to call that out. He didn't shy away from the virus, the American mission is too great to let some illness get in the way of the American dream. The American dream does not surrender to anything, nevertheless a Chinese-lab made virus. He gained tons of new supporters in the African American communities and damn near won Miami because his message on socialism was so close to home to the latino communities. It was clear that he was winning support from minority communities who appreciated that the opportunity zones created with Tim Scott led to tremendous decreases in minority unemployment. He won over new voting coalitions and encouraged many voters to come back and vote for the first time in a while.. . Joe Biden was a 47yr lifelong politician who was best known for drafting the Crime bill that locked everyone up except his son for smoking crack. Also known for often lying, like in law school saying he was at the top of his class, but really was cheating his way by near the bottom of his class. He became a senator in one of the easiest states to be a senator and did nothing but act as a bitter partisan. He hid in his basement for months, yet, when he did go out and campaign, he couldn't even get 50 people and that was with the press core. It was more common to see Biden Protestors at his events than actual supporters. He did terrible in Iowa, NH, before getting his campaign resurrected by Super delegates and well timed dropouts. His presidency has been so pathetic - he won't take questions from the media, he won't address anything going on with the border, and he isn't doing anything for inflation except tax and spend more of our money. He decided to take a long vacation this weekend while the Taliban is taking over US assets and provincial capitals within Afghanistan. We were energy independent, until Joey Bribes cut Keystone, pissing off Canada, then told OPEC to pump more oil. This is sky rocketing food costs by the way, look at chicken feed costs and the price of meat. None of this was talked about. Joe Biden had no platform, no support during his campaign, and 450,000 fraudulent ballots out of Arizona prove it. There is no way in hell Joey bribes is more popular than Obama who has all the swagger to knockout every Pokemon in the Pokedex. Whether or not you liked his politics or his lies, Obama was way more crafty as a politician than Joe, who has total soup between his ears. Obama was the first black president and people came out in droves to support this change. Joe didn't have shit going for him. They secretaries of state and the state supreme courts did everything in their power not to look at the clear cut evidence of the fraud and the media did everything in their power to obfuscate this truth. No way Joe could have earned 12 million votes more than Obama because he had nothing, Trump could have easily hustled 15M more votes than McCain especially after promises made promises kept.",-1.0,error,0.0

t1_h923a7e,2021-08-15 18:06:25,t1_h8y0bd9,t3_p3f3v4,"Ah, so part of the confusion is that LEO is **not** touching the workload disparity issue (in this round of negotiations). As you point out, in Dearborn & Flint 100% FTE is 4/4 or 8 classes per year whereas in Ann Arbor it is 3/3 or 6 classes per year. So, when the minimum FTE for Lecs in Dearborn & Flint is $41K that translates to roughly $5125 per class. For Ann Arbor the minimum FTE is 51K or $8500 per class. LEO's proposals for pay equity are not on a per class or credit hour basis, but merely pay parity according to what qualifies as 100% employment (Full Time Equivalence) at each campus (and the different Academic Units).. . So, LEO wants starting pay at all three campuses to be the same, but that pay is tied to FTE & not per class/credit hour pay. Even with getting equal salaries across the three campuses, Lecs in Dearborn & Flint will still be getting paid less for their efforts than Ann Arbor Lecs. The increases being proposed are only to get 41K to 54K (a 31% increase) for 4/4 labor, or $6750 per class (3cr hr) which is still 80% of the current minimums in Ann Arbor on a class-by-class basis ;-(. . Workload parity is going to be a much longer fight (they say that Collective Bargaining is like a running a series of marathons). In our current negotiations it was a very big deal to just get different Academic Units to agree to write down what constitutes 100% FTE. . .
