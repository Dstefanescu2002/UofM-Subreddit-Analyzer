For 280, they would give you tutorials on Visual Studio, Xcode and Visual Studio Code. So you can stick with Visual Studio or choose VScode. Personally, I use VScode because it's super clean and I am pretty comfortable with setting up debuggers and all that. But that's just personal. There really isn't that much the difference between all of them. . . Just some extra 2 cents for 280. What would really help you is knowing terminal command and Makefiles. You would want to know how to use Makefiles to run your code. How to use input redirects ( project 2) to automated the process when testing. Also, most importantly, know how to setup a debugger and debug through your code. Doesn't matter which IDE it is, know the exact details on how to make it happen.

t1_h9in709,2021-08-19 10:44:14,t1_h6tl5jb,t3_oszj7h,"To follow up on this now that I've had some time to really think about things and do a little research of my own, I believe either we are having a misunderstanding here (my fault, because I didn't elaborate on my stance), or, if you understand my viewpoint but still disagree (totally fine), I should at least help you understand fully what you're disagreeing with.. . Below, I respond to your post in detail. But to summarize my stance: I do appreciate you explaining your stance - it's helped me improve my own - but the reason why I still stand by my stance, that would be ok for OP to record their class lecture for personal use, is mainly because it's for personal education enrichment - there is no intent to share/distribute that recording, and no intent of using it as any kind of evidence for any legal proceeding. Recording in this context is literally an augmentation to the recall our own brains do - it's just reviewing what the professor said after the class, enhancing your notes accordingly, then deleting the recording. I sympathize with anyone who might feel uncomfortable with this, but I've had my picture taken in public places without my permission, even though I was by myself and wanting to keep to myself, and there's nothing I can legally do about that.. . On my end, I paid for my school tuition and I mean to get the best out of my education. If I can't type or write fast enough for the professor, and they've provided no alternate means to review the class lecture, then I'm not going to deny myself a legitimate way to use technology to help me get the best educational experience I can. I recognize the perceived privacy problem; on the flip side, please understand the potential educational dilemma on the opposite side. (I understand most professors wouldn't be like this, but even looking back on my past professors, I'm confident that this number would be non-zero, which does make this a relevant issue.). . Ultimately, our differing sentiments aside, as I understand it, this boils down to: 1) Is Michigan a one- or two- party consent state, and 2) is there a reasonable expectation of privacy in a given UofM college classroom. (Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the source of our disagreement may be regarding #2: I'm guessing you'd stand by your view that you and your students are entitled to privacy in your classroom, whereas I would maintain that if the building is open to the public during those class hours, then no, there is not a reasonable expectation of privacy in the classroom (unlike, say, a bathroom, or a faculty office).. . . . >Notifying people that they may be recorded, whether via audio or video, is not just a legal requirement in many jurisdictions,. . Historically, Michigan has been a one-party consent state. That means that permission is not required of both parties as long as the recording party is part of the conversation. In the classroom, I would interpret that to mean that a student can record the lecture without the professor's permission, just like the professor can record the class session without asking their students. (Obviously, as you mentioned, there may be social repercussions, such as a breach of trust/goodwill; I'm not indifferent to that concern.). . (Apparently, a recent ruling by a Michigan court has called this into question. It may be that Michigan becomes a two-party consent state, in which case, not only would a student be required to inform the professor, but they would need actual permission from the professor. This also means that if a professor wanted to record his/her lecture, I believe it would then require the permission of every single student, and if a single student says no, then the recording cannot happen. Pro: personal privacy better upheld. Con: Potentially unnecessary inconvenience/impossibility.. . . . >but an important privacy concern, and a sign of respect for privacy we all owe to each other. Especially in the modern world.. . I agree. Potential consequences of breech of trust and goodwill, etc., should not be callously ignored.. . . . >Here's the UM page describing, in painstaking details, rules and best practices for instructors recording their classes during remote instruction due to COVID, when it was often unavoidable due to students getting ill, or living in very different time zones and thus needing asynchronous access to lecture materials, and what they owe to the students: [https://safecomputing.umich.edu/privacy/privacy-u-m/videoconferencing/recording-privacy-concerns](https://safecomputing.umich.edu/privacy/privacy-u-m/videoconferencing/recording-privacy-concerns). While recording the instructor by a student is not a FERPA violation, all other concerns apply.. . Thank you again for this info! It was helpful.. . . . >Don't you think the instructors are entitled to have control over their privacy?!. . Personally, yes, I agree with your sentiment. Legally? The law (as I understand it) does not favor this sentiment in this context. If the instructor is in their own office, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. If the instructor is in a bathroom, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. If the instructor is in a classroom, much less one that anyone can physically walk into/out of, no, there is not a reasonable expectation of privacy.. . . . >In addition to concerns of privacy of instructors and other students, there are issues of copyright and, in certain situations, confidentiality of the lecture materials, which the instructor might decide/be obligated not to include if being recorded by any other method than the officially sanctioned ones.. . You're bringing up a non-issue here, in relation to our debate, because in this particular context, there would be no sharing or distribution of any such materials. I can't agree with your point, anyway, because, if we carry your point to its logical conclusion, then that means that students would not be permitted to take notes in this class. Which (I hope you can agree with me) is clearly ludicrous. I maintain that, for private use, taking notes (and by extension, creating a recording for explicitly personal educational use and no other use), is not a problem.. . . . >On the other hand, it is likely that most instructors will be themselves creating and providing recordings of some class activities for a while, since we are still in a situation where people need remote access (e.g., if they feel under the weather, or quarantining due to a positive test or close contact, and so should not be coming to classes for a few days).. . I agree. And kudos to you and other professors (including two friends of mine who are also professors) for all the extra work you've had to do to prep for recordings and hybrid styles of teaching! Given how much you must already do, it's crazy to basically have another job on top of your job. On behalf of your students, thanks for your dedication.. . . . >So, I expect that, at least for a while, there'll be no need for students to consider improvising their own recordings.. . I can accept this. This is a helpful perspective that - believe it or not - didn't occur to me before. If every professor I've ever had did this, then indeed no, I would not ever feel the need to make my own recordings. Problem solved!. . . . >I myself teach on north campus, where all classrooms are wired for the automated ""lecture capture"" system, and have been recording and posting lecture videos online (through the sanctioned system that only allows access to students enrolled in the class) since the swine flu (or was it bird flu?) epidemic 10 or so years ago. :-). . Great to hear that it's automatic! To me, that implies that it's an asset to the students, while being less work for you/the faculty. A win-win, in my mind.. . . . If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I hope that, even if we must agree to disagree in some areas, maybe there are places where we share the same thoughts/views/sentiments. If we can't fully agree, then having overlapping views and understanding each other's viewpoints is the next best thing, in my opinion. Cheers, and thanks for investing in future generations of leaders. :). . (Edit: Forgot to mention, the part where your arguments have improved my stance, is that, looking back, I should've first talked to the professor, made sure they didn't have recordings of their own, given feedback about their speaking style (volume issues, clarity of voice, speed, etc.), and only in the case that a professor refused to listen to any of this, and provided no alternative, would I even consider making this kind of personal recording, explicitly for personal note taking, and for no other purpose. After taking my notes, I'd delete the recording.)",1.0,error,0.0

I was diagnosed with IBS the summer after my freshman year (senior now) after suffering pretty much my whole time at school and avoiding eating and a bunch of other not so healthy things.. . One thing you can take advantage of while on campus is the research UMich does--there's actually a ton of ongoing studies for people suffering with IBS ranging from the famous low FODMAP diet to more experimental stuff like getting a low electrical pulse applied to your stomach to see if it'd stimulate digestive health (I think that was one I saw but don't quote me).. . The thing that helps me the most (I'm predominantly -C as well) is regularly taking the LaLa Probiotic smoothies, which you can find at Meijer or Kroger and the like. I also find that cutting back on milk helps too, but I have a lot of trouble with eating regularly so I often break that rule for the Carnation Breakfast Essentials--if you can spare spending a little more and don't care too much one way or another about taste or texture, lactose-free milk options are definitely worth it too. If you have a sweet tooth, swap out ice cream for sorbet (I find that sorbets taste richer too so I'm inclined to eat less as well). . . Other than that, regularly eating some veggies (not too much) and multivitamins should suffice, and when all else fails you should absolutely have a heating pad or blanket to help with the cramps.. . You should take all this with a grain of salt, however, as I'm also adhd and autistic and grew up poor without my parents ever implementing a diet or regular eating schedule, so I'm still struggling with all of that myself + trying to remember on my own when to eat when my body doesn't tell me in its hungry, my body punishes me for eating, and my adhd often means I forget or put it off or my meds mess with my apetitie, OR I let food spoil because of how out of sight out of mind I can get :')",5.0,neutral,0.5811759233474731

I also had concerns about adhd and autism grow, only to have them ignored and demeaned by UHS and CAPS. Sought out help at the nearby St. Joe's instead after some time on my lonesome during the pandemic with resulted in no life management whatsoever and some trouble with alcohol and, after fighting with insurance and getting the run-around for 6ish months, low and behold: I'm autistic and ADHD, with a side of PTSD, depression, and anxiety.. . I have a lot of regrets, most of them about things I did or didn't do that I didn't know any better regarding, like how to properly interact with and make(and keep) friends, what to expect in a romantic relationship (bad home and poor social skills = thinking abuse is normal), and not using social opportunities to my advantage (eating alone at dining halls, not really hanging out with classmates after class, spending all my free time with the aforementioned abusive partner, not going to parties or games simply due to my discomfort, not seeing through to any clubs etc). I also regret not going to office hours and asking for help, forging bonds with professors, etc. Another big regret is not seeking out disability services prior to my autism and adhd diagnoses, as they are capable of helping you even before the official diagnoses. Oh, and when you're an upperclassmen, your financial aid qualifications may change because they can count your past financial aid as income and use it against you. .

LSA has graduations for each department, while other schools like Kinesiology and Ross have a combined graduation for all their majors.

They might call people who graduated with distinction first, but most people won't be in that category. If you have more than one major then you'll have multiple events to go to that week.

However, someone in the thread the other day mentioned they could see the construction site and was watching a roof being installed. I believe it is unlikely any building with a roof being installed this week is going to be ready to live in by early September. Typically the roof is done quite early in the construction process since you want protection from the elements while you install electrical/ventilation/plumbing/insulation/flooring/fixtures/windows and all the other interior finishing. Each of those specialties is a different team of contractors who require a few days to do their work and they often cannot work in the same space simultaneously. . . Now it is *possible* for that work to be done back-to-back within a few weeks, if the workers are available and supplies are on-site. For a large project, that may well be the case: it could be that after delays everyone is working crazy overtime to get it done. And all kinds of other caveats may apply: different buildings could be at different stages. Or maybe the roof of one building was defective and had to be replaced.. . So please don't make any decisions based on this comment alone. But still, seeing a roof being installed on August 20 for a move-in date of September 9 is not a good sign.. . Edit: prefab construction is another caveat. If they are doing prefab everything I wrote about timeline is off, because you are basically just slapping together pieces of the building like Legos in a few days. I think prefab would be atypical for an apartment complex, though.. .

I have absolutely no academic/studied knowledge about this, so I probably don't really have the best terminology lol. Being traditional/authentic to me just means having food that tastes like what you would get in that country, like how the food is traditionally made in that country. *Usually* what you would get from a normal family from that culture. . . At places that have both traditional & ""westernized"" dishes, if they make the traditional foods properly (and the menu is mostly traditional) then that's basically authentic to me. Lots of times I think the butter chicken type dishes are there because that's what locals are used to lol. . Personally, this issue usually doesn't matter to me unless I'm specifically looking for an authentic taste. Like I would not go to Panda if I'm in the mood for real Chinese food. That's why in my comment, I wrote ""for anyone who might care"" and ""anyone who was expecting authentic Indian"" - not everyone cares (and you don't have to), but if you're looking for something authentic, I just wanted to give a heads up that it won't be here, even if the food is good. Also, many people haven't had Indian food before in the first place, so I feel like it's noteworthy to say that it isn't truly representative of the real cultural food. . . As for that point, maybe it just ties into my own culture. I'm Chinese, and using the Panda example, I would really hate if people thought that's what real Chinese food is - like if someone had instant top ramen and thought that's what real ramen is like. I want my culture to be represented properly, there are so many wonderful things to be found, and for it to just be dumbed down to Panda Express type food feels so misleading and a little insulting (like if people never had Chinese and thought it was traditionally. like that, and no one clarified or something). . This being said though, I feel like I need to clarify that I'm not against Curry On/Panda type restaurants lmao. I've eaten them for dinner many times with no regrets, and I live by instant ramen. This whole thing is just, again, for anyone who might care if their meal is traditional or not, and I'm not saying it should or shouldn't be. Cheap & good is usually good enough for me lol.

I think the rational fear about that is if the bed is damaged or set up improperly, which you can guard against by carefully inspecting it, or extreme rough-housing or other idiocy on the top bunk.. . The more rational fear, and these are routine, are injuries involving the top bunk. In 1998, a freshman, Courtney Cantor, fatally fell out a 6 story window at Mary Markley dorm, either while or after climbing up her loft ladder. Alcohol was involved, but even a sober person can roll off the top bunk, slip climbing up, or break a bone jumping down.. . Speaking of which, alcohol poisoning and related injuries are a good rational fear, as are fraternities in general. Phi Delta Theta, the fraternity where Cantor got drunk, reopened last year, after an unrelated suspension from 2018. U-M has an ebb and flow of tolerating felony crimes at fraternities, and I think they've been shifting toward greater tolerance for rape and sexual assaults in particular, and violence, hazing, and substance abuse in general, in the last few years.

Instead of increasing what you might get, it can worsen your position significantly by making you sound like a lunatic.. . Asking for half rent for the entire lease period is not reasonable. You're not losing that many thousands of dollars in pure ""I am paying this out of my pocket"" costs--especially since they're using an option to give you a hotel to stay in--and that's what matters. You want to be made whole for what you're losing. You can certainly negotiate with just above what you anticipate to lose as a negotiating point, but $6000 to fold up and put in your pocket? Over and above the hotel and per diem? Madness. (Assuming an average of $1000/mo rent for a year, from the range in your article.). . For more actionable advice regarding the $50/day, I'll point out the per diem rates used by the US Government when its employees: [https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-lookup/?action=perdiems\_report&state=MI&fiscal\_year=2022&zip=&city=Ann%20Arbor](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-lookup/?action=perdiems_report&state=MI&fiscal_year=2022&zip=&city=Ann%20Arbor). . Since they're covering hotels, ignore all of the stuff about that; that's just what we're allowed to reserve in terms of a hotel room and will be reimbursed for when we travel. The more important point will be the $69/day per diem for food, itself less than the per diem they're proposing.. . I want to emphasize this: *there is no legal requirement for them to use this guidance*. It is purely what the General Services Administration feels is for somewhat decent eating out in restaurants when you're traveling, instead of having access to your own kitchen (which is why the first and last day travel are less--they expect the day you leave you'll eat breakfast and home, and the day you get back you'll eat dinner at home.). . It's also pretty generous--because you don't submit receipts for food, you just get the per diem--plenty of government employees will eat for way less than this while traveling and pocket the difference, which is totally allowed. Lots of people make a lot of money on per diem while traveling. Of course, some of us like to eat out at nice restaurants and pay less out of pocket for a nice meal, too! But, understand it's possible to eat pretty well for less than this, it's closer to a ceiling than a floor.. . But it does give you some ideas about ""reasonable"" costs per day that people can be out of pocket when they don't have access to their kitchen and are in Ann Arbor. Note, however, that this $69 per diem *doesn't* include travel costs--an Uber/taxi or a rental car would be reimbursed as a totally separate item.. . When you draft demands, try to hew closer to these numbers for food, and add for reasonable travel--which can include a van pool or combining Uber. You can go a little above them, if you want to quibble with them and to have some headroom to negotiate, but astronomically higher will just turn people looking from the outside off.",2.0,error,0.0

However, I do have some minor corrections, and think your ambivalence due to inevitability is premature.. . . . >*All the research tells us that COVID is now endemic*. . That's not clear. It's clear that the virus is here for the long haul, but endemicity would be characterized by perpetual low to moderate transmission, with regular, somewhat predictable outbreaks within a region. The world is still experiencing extreme months-long surges sweeping across continents, consistent with a pandemic. Some parts of the US have returned to full hospitals, full ICUs, and oxygen shortages, as Michigan experienced in April. The huge wave of new cases in the US/Canada/Mexico is mirrored in Korea/Japan and Germany/France.. . . . >*Every single unvaccinated person in the country can get vaccinated if they want to, TODAY*. . 14.6% of the population is under the age of 12, and are currently ineligible for vaccination in the US. Clinical trials are underway for subjects age 5 to 11, and if those are approved as expected, we'll begin testing lower ages. They represent a disproportionately high number of new cases, and a disproportionately low number of Covid hospitalizations (roughly 2%), so are fortunately less of a concern, but they're not of no concern. Aggressive government efforts to combat anti-Covid measures in schools have no precedent, adding a bit of a wildcard to outcomes this fall.. . . . >*As long as hospitals aren't overrun....*. . That's unfortunately not a foregone conclusion in Michigan. Hospitals in many states are out of room, and are shuttling patients to other cities and states, or to makeshift facilities. Several mid-Michigan are nearing capacity again, and with only one prior fall season of data, forecasting models are too uncertain to predict anything about where things will go.. . . . >*This means that people will constantly die from this for the foreseeable future no matter what we do*. . Absolutely true, but rates of death and permanent injury are not immovable, and forestalling major outbreaks allows time for more research on treatments and vaccines that could reduce the number severe outcomes. If it were a question of the same number of people dying of Covid this semester, or next semester, it would suck, but I'm heartless enough to say party on, dude. But if it's a matter of 10,000 people dying of downstream transmissions this semester, vs. 5,000 dying if people exercise more restraint, I'd endorse restraint.. . Some of the the biggest area with major impacts before the end of the year are apt to be adjustments to vaccine dosage and booster regimens, and new vaccine formulations. But we're also seeing ongoing increases in vaccination rates. 2.6% of the US became fully vaccinated in the last month. I have considerable indifference to the fate of the willfully unvaccinated, but higher rates of vaccination help everybody by accelerating Covid's shift to endemicity.. . Everyone will decide on their own balance of risks, but I think your attitude may undervalue the benefit of some continued caution.",11.0,error,0.0

t1_hajb4em,2021-08-27 09:28:53,t3_pci9vw,t3_pci9vw,"I came into UofM as a 4.0 high school valedictorian on a hefty scholarship. I fucked up. I didn't know how to study and if that's entirely my fault and not due to the, what the US government likely calls 'adequate', public education I was brought up with then so be it. However, things aren't all bad. I learned a lot from the unfortunate mugging and subsequent beating my ego took, and I'm fairly certain I came out better. What am I on about? Well, I came into my first semester with nothing but high expectations for myself, and ohhh boy did I disappoint. My grades went from pretty good, to all over the place, second year I was in a rut. My grades were scraping by just to pass so I don't end up having to stick around in my own mental hell any bit longer. The inevitable ""C's get degrees"" and ""I just need to pass"" lies were often told to myself by myself. My grades were shit. But my junior year I began to figure things out, like a rusty bolt that penetrating fluid finally dripped into enough to break it free, my grades began to recover. Better yet I feel better about myself, my abilities, and I'm learning better. I walked across the board that bridges two cliffs and came out with but a sliver in my foot. Grades don't matter, a 3.0 or better is great but most of us weren't properly equipped for that at the start. So let go of the stress. Take care of your brain and learn at it's pace. Don't overfill your hopper so to speak. Focus on truly understanding the big picture of the class content and the small details will follow suit as you explore the content. To be more literal, take care of your mental and physical health, live to live not just to work and study, once you can figure out the rate at which you learn you can optimize the flow of information from your classes by breaking things up by week. And always take Sundays off to unwind, have a coke or something sweet. You won't learn anything if you lose sleep and cram the whole semester. And I don't mean last minute cramming or losing sleep, I mean I've turned my thoughts into alphabet soup by boiling it with more than I could handle. Professors and GSI's can tell when you're in that state and usually will try to offer help, but you really should reach out as well.. . So to itemize:. 1. Take the time to put in the work. 2. You absolutely do not need the best grades, no one will care after you have any experience in the field. Even then only select companies will even bother asking for your GPA.. 3. Mental and physical health and wellbeing are crucial to making your brain run at full power. You wouldn't take the radiator off your car then drive it would you?. 4. There are so many people before you who have face the same challenges and most are eager to give their advice and help. Ask for it when you feel you need it, no matter how dumb you feel. Your ego is a pathological liar.. 5. Really give yourself time to have fun. Living to work isn't living, and studying is a form of work.. . .

Two benefits: . -- You'll automatically start keeping a tab on such spends. Having fun is important, but it is so very easy to overspend and then regret it. When you know that you have to transfer x% of today's drinking bill into your mutual fund then you'll be more wary of ordering that super costly bottle of scotch.. -- Increases your investments.. Never a bad thing.. . 4) Get a Credit Card and learn to use it wisely.. A cc is an amazing financial instrument if used properly.. - It helps build you a strong credit history.. - It is much more secure band insulates you from frauds better than a debit card.. - You can earn an interest on the money that stays in your account for an extra 30odd days.. - Awesome rewards.",1.0,neutral,0.5754801034927368

A lot of the stipulations with the endowment spending are self-inflicted, actually (most notably, the the cap on spending based on a moving average of past investment returns - which is arguably the most intense restriction we have with endowment spending). Also, there is no evidence that there is not enough accessible funds in the endowment that prevent the University from rectifying the situation shown in this thread.. . Endowment hoarding enriches fund managers because it gives them more money in fees. Almost any kind of fund vehicle has fees that are not even dependent on returns - from low cost ETFs to more expensive ""2 and 20"" arrangements with Private Equity (which is something that has become very popular for college endowments).. . . . >You can make an argument that there needs to be a different payout rate, sure.. .

What you are experiencing is totally normal. In fact I think 70% of new students experience severe homesickness according to a national poll. Coming from someone with prior anxiety issues, the best way I deal with this is to distract myself. I slowly but surely found some new people to interact with at least a couple times a day. I am working on a routine now in terms of going to bed at a good time, getting everything ready for classes, going to exercise, taking time to breathe and relax, etc. It keeps my mind off of stress and anxiety for most of the day. Try not to get too deep into your thoughts. These are irrational fears in response to a rapid change in surroundings, but so does adult life bring us many of these experiences. Eventually, we have to move on from our mothers, fathers, and relatives into independent life. That doesn't mean we abandon them, but rather we reconcile with the fact that we have adult obligations. For example, I am trying to think that when I grow up I'll be successful and be able to provide for my parents the same way they provided for me. Just have positive thoughts. The move away from the same homes we grew up in is an inevitable circumstance. Be bold and take things one step at a time. One day, you will look back and laugh at how trivial your concerns were. Think about how some of our immigrant parents studied hundreds or thousands of miles away from home in much worse conditions. You have nothing to fear, especially with your final 2 years here, and a few sizeable breaks to see family if money and time permits . As for your physical symptoms, understand that the body and mind are connected. Often times, mental discomfort manifests as physical symptoms. That is our brain telling our body something isn't right. If you reduce the stress and anxiety with the aforementioned, your physical symptoms will fade. Understand that professional help is a time/financial commitment. I'd try finding tactics to cope naturally first. Hope this helped.",13.0,neutral,0.5906959176063538

I figured I could make the same connections if *I* was the one who did that instead.

It is entirely proof based, and these proofs are nightmare 3 pagers. On average, it's about 15 pages of homework a week, and between 12-20 hours of work a week. There's also no lectures, you learn by doing worksheets in class. It's definitely not world endingly hard like STEM redditors circlejerk, but I dedicated 4 hours a day for 4 days each day to 217 (started homework Monday, then worked from 4:00-8:00 each day on it till its Thursday due date). I liked to chill on weekends but a good plan would be to start on weekends. I also had no group, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND A GROUP. . . . -saving grace: borderline impossible to fail 217, like you literally need 20/100 on the exams to pass with the curve. An A is tough.. . 3. 217 is the hardest of the math specific classes and probably the hardest in this major. The financial math classes are actually really fun according to a friend of mine (I haven't taken them). . . 4. 286 is ""easy"" in terms of workload, but tests have a nasty upper quartile for an A. I'd take it, you can goof off and get a B but you will have to put a lot of hours for an A. . . 5. Upper level stats classes are chill and really fun,",14.0,neutral,0.6559320092201233
t1_haz21ju,2021-08-30 20:37:02,t3_pepnon,t3_pepnon,"The math department is a nice place to be as a math major. Once you get past 215, the class sizes shrink and it's a generally good time. While the intro courses have a reputation, it's also only a tiny fragment of what the department (which is huge with like 7 different majors) does and most of the math majors I knew liked their experience.. . 1. I'll be honest 217 is a lot of work. The linear algebra aspect is not what makes it hard, but rather the fact that you are learning to write proofs. The class can be a better or worse experience depending on the professor, as is often true. Scott Schneider has a long standing reputation as a particularly excellent instructor.. 217 is IBL, so you'll be doing math during class and won't really have much lecture-type instruction, this can be a really good time or a really bad time depending on how you prefer to learn, but many people really enjoy the IBL style courses. I personally loved my experience in 217.. The problem sets are hard and time consuming but if you make friends and seek out help as you need it, it is doable. The math lab is an option and so are office hours.. . 2. Taking 217 as a sophomore seems pretty on par.. . 3. The upper level courses are a good time (although I was a pure math major so I can't necessarily speak specifically to the fin math courses), I think 217 was peak for the most time consuming for me.. . 4. Depends on your vibes. I hated 316 because I dislike rote calculations and repetitive algorithmic tasks. I think it was more content than anything else, and I wish I'd taken 286. However, I know fin math folks who loved it. Again, your experience can be somewhat professor dependent, definitely check past syllabi if they've taught before.. . 5. The math department is a great space to be. There are plenty of support resources and social/professional resources available to you. The advisors are solid and the different student groups are nice -- they provide a good sense of community. I think the department cares a good bit about people feeling welcomed into the community, and I really enjoyed my time there. I can't speak super well to the fin math/actuarial science side of the department as I occupied space with pure/honors folks along with other double majors, but I know there are student groups and the department career fair always seemed more targeted towards those kinds of aspects.",7.0,positive,0.8898246884346008

The [U-M COVID Dashboard](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/dashboard) continues to be weirdly inscrutable. Last week's report was 303 tests. Which seems... low. But wait, the Community Sampling and Tracking Program had 2,185 tests that week. So... the CSTP tests aren't included in the main dashboard count? But they used to be -- looking back at the numbers for April '21 there were 12-15k CSTP tests and 15-20k tests overall. And the description says ""*this data represents campus testing... [through a bunch of sources] and the Community Sampling and Tracking Program*"".. . The percentages don't make any sense either. Last week's data was 28 cases from 303 tests. But the positivity is 18.5%? If you include the outside testing, there were 56 cases. 56/303 = 18.5%. But the description says outside testing is from the Washtenaw County Health Department, while the positivity rate specifically **excludes** ""*cases identified by the Washtenaw County Health Department*"".. .

The data rely on cycle threshold (Ct) measurements to estimate virus concentration in nasal fluids, so these are lab-based estimates of contagiousness rather than real world studies. But in layperson's terms, Delta replicates a shit-ton faster than earlier variants.^(3). . And while Ct-based estimates show lower contagiousness while asymptomatic, and peak contagiousness shortly after onset of symptoms, multiple studies of earlier data estimate that asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases combined account for the majority of transmission.^(4, 5) Logically, some people reduce higher risk exposure to others once they become symptomatic, so lower viral loads while asymptomatic could be offset by relatively riskier behavior during that period.. . ^(1) Thompson, M.

Universities offer a number of services that are directly tied to their mission, such as library assistance, or because students are far from their usual provider, such as offering a health clinic. But they are increasingly expected to step in and solve broader social issues and offer services that aren't necessarily central to their mission but that are lacking in the area where they are located. Universities are expected to address deficiencies in child care, public transportation, affordable housing, food security, mental health care and more. They may get some external or public funding for this, but not a lot (these are things that are regularly underfunded by public funding). It puts a lot of pressure on tuition. And it may not be very efficient, because these is not areas of higher education expertise.. . So while you're a student on campus, and you need assistance immediately, it's completely understandable why you would seek all these kinds of services. But I also think we should look at the bigger picture, and consider advocating that these are provided by agencies and organizations who specialize in them, and make them more accessible to all who need them (not just college students lucky enough to go to colleges which try to offer them). . .

I'd agree with you that a lot of people in CS are just there to get a good job after grad, however the sheer *workload* of some eecs classes are baffling. . . For example, EECS 281 is 4 credits. There are 4 projects, quizzes, discussion sessions and exams on top of the normal lecture. On average to do well on the projects you need to start them early and work consistently (so about 2-4 hours a day if not more for about 2 weeks). That's a total of 14-28 hours a week on projects alone, not counting class time and general studying time. I'd say there are weeks I spent upwards of 35 hours on just EECS 281. . . A class I took at the same time was Ling 209, also a 4 credit level 200 class. The class was graded on participation, quizzes and exams. I spent 7 hours on this class a *month* outside of class time and got an A. . . Even in comparison with English 125 and Stats 250, which most LSA ppl take, I'd say EECS 280 (which is also a freshman/sophomore level class) is 2-3 times more work for the same number of credits. . . Again, just my personal experience. I love CS and it's why I'm doing it, but every single CS class I've taken was a lot.

. Suppose that your malicious friend Mallory sets up a WiFi network that is also called ""MWireless"" and tries to lure other people to connect to his WiFi instead of the legitimate MWireless. In this case, verifying the certificate allows devices to distinguish between a legitimate network and a bogus one, and prevent sending login credentials (although the password is still encrypted) or sending Internet traffic through the malicious access point.. .

Sometimes devices may fail to verify the server's certificate for whatever reasons (e.g., about a month ago the certificate seems to expire temporarily).

COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within 6 feet) for a prolonged period of time (at least 15 minutes).

t1_hbmhs66,2021-09-04 23:07:52,t3_pi0qtv,t3_pi0qtv,"I'm just gonna spill out some of what I learned regarding being social in college as a shy anti-social person (sorry if it's long).. . Try your ass off these first couple of weeks after starting. In this time it's socially acceptable to literally just go up to meet people because everyone is doing the same. If you have an opportunity to do anything with other people, take that opportunity, don't turn anything down. Don't be a hermit in your room when you aren't working.. . Here are some ways to meet people: If you're living in a dorm, it's fair game to talk to everyone in your hall. Keep your door open for others to say hi, and say hi to others who are doing the same. When you meet people there, INVITE THEM TO DO THINGS with you. This could be as simple as going to the dining hall together or playing video games in your room or tossing a frisbee around. Maybe one of them will know of parties and you can go with them to one. Even the dining hall itself at the beginning, go sit with some others who just moved in and introduce yourself. Get peoples phone numbers (or whatever the fuck social media thing kids use nowadays). Join at least one club/extracurricular group. You can go to the first meetings for a bunch of them and keep the one that looks the most promising. Surely there is some group that interests you. I think that's the biggest way people make friends (it was dorms for me but a lot of those groups had tight-knit communities). In class, introduce yourself to people around you, even just one person. Some classes have study groups you can sign up for. If you can't live in a dorm, maybe look at co-ops which were a great way to make friends through living in one and being part of that community. Another option is joining a frat. I know next to nothing about that since it didn't interest me, but people there make friends for life. There's also getting a job/work study position. Not only can you make money and maybe add to your resume but it's just another chance to be around others. If you play any sports, see if they offer any intramural sports, maybe try rec sports classes I've seen at the gyms or pickup basketball, etc.. . I know it might feel like you can't do any of these things if you're like me, but really try and fake it for just two weeks. When I was trying, I had to actively motivate myself to do all that constantly. You might see some of the kids from your high school sticking together by themselves and think everyone is like that. I promise it's not. You might see people start to make friend groups quickly and think that you lost your chance. That's not true either, in the beginning after moving in you CAN join those groups you see (I was even able to join one of them in like April after starting school in September).. . For me, I tried hard to make friends for three years in college, but only ended up making any my second year. If I only tried two of those years and gave up, I would have come out of it thinking it's impossible, but now I know there was nothing wrong with me, I just needed to keep trying and stay hopeful. So DON'T GET DISCOURAGED OR FALL INTO DESPAIR if you don't make any for the whole year even (two of my college years I didn't, it's a tough world for shy recluses like me). Just try to PUT IN THE EFFORT, you have nothing to lose.",132.0,error,0.0

Even if one lived in a nearby rental house or apartment paying the same rate, they wouldn't get the same deal as a coop, which includes access to commercial grade restaurant kitchens and our biggest selling point which is food. The average student spends about $250 on food cost per month so if you live in an apartment, you still have to pay for your own groceries. . . Also the coops are not expensive for low-income students. We offer students need-based scholarships that can cover up to $300 per month.

Also, when flu season rolls around, we do this magical thing - we VACCINATE most everyone, including children 6 months and older. Last I checked, we can't vaccinate children under 12 years old against Covid - yet.. . We are trying to PREVENT hospitals from getting to the point of being overrun. . . For those who don't know, our hospitals operate at nearly maximum capacity BEFORE we factor in Covid. This has been true for decades - it is not financially feasible to run a hospital where 50% of the ICU beds sit unused just waiting for that once in a century pandemic. It takes very few Covid cases to push us beyond baseline capacity at which point we have to start refusing interhospital transfers, ceasing surgical procedures and outpatient appointments, and converting important in-person health care delivery to telemedicine. In short, medical care is compromised for thousands with just a mild increase in Covid hospitalization rates (which broadly correlate with case rates).. . We can start comparing our societal responses to influenza and Covid once we actually treat them identically. It's entirely possible that with universal vaccination, Covid will become a blip on the radar compared to something like influenza. But until we are legally able to provide all people with the Covid vaccine, we would be playing a very dangerous game assuming that Covid will continue to have limited effects on children as it continues to mutate rapidly in the setting of incomplete vaccination.. . Edit: people also forget that UM is a tertiary referral center. We treat people for a variety of issues, including severe cases of Covid, they many other hospitals in Michigan and elsewhere do not have the capability and staffing to treat. So while using A2 zip code-based numbers to estimate Covid burden is fine at a hyperlocal level, those numbers don't always represent what the primary hospital in this county is seeing. This is doubly true for Mott Children's as no other hospital in the county is certified to care for the majority of pediatric issues.",6.0,negative,0.5169192552566528

I'm not saying this is because of Covid, indeed we have these issues periodically every few months. I don't know how the HHS is calculating room use, but at least at Mott, our bed numbers are in the single digits on a good day. What I do know is that not every hospital bed is a potential Covid-ready bed. At maximum capacity last year we estimated only 750 or so of our 1000+ beds could be used for Covid. This is why we contracted with the US military to begin preparing for tent hospitals on south campus. All of this is to say, I suspect the HHS numbers do not tell the full story, unfortunately.. . I agree that using a single hospital's numbers can seem misleading as there are undoubtedly other hospitals in the area that have open beds.

We learn so much more building the car and sorting out all sorts of issues than you would learn in a typical semester of classes. . . . . Since you're saying you attended the mass meeting, perhaps we didn't explain it properly: we aren't always designing for pure speed. In fact the endurance portion of our competition makes up a very large amount of the number of points that we can gain. While it's preferable to finish first in all the competitions, most important is finishing at all. A lot of teams that go to comp (\~55%) don't end up actually finishing the endurance race.. . . . Efficiency is also a big factor for us as well. Not only do we get points for how efficient we are but the more efficient we can get our vehicle, the smaller we can make our battery pack and reduce the mass of the car, which... does help us go faster. But you see the point, a lot of things have to go into making a fast car, it's not always just optimizing all your design parameters for top speed. In fact, as a member of Drivetrain this year, I can say that the top speed of the car doesn't factor into our gearbox calculations as much as you might think they do, we're much more focused on the predicted tire performance for our car. We do calculate the theoretical value for shits and giggles but we haven't hit that number at comp anyways.. . . . Since you didn't say what sort of engineering you're leaning towards, I do want to point out for you and any other students in the same boat that there are plenty of opportunities for ALL majors, not just mechanical engineering. We have so many electric and embedded systems so electrical engineering and computer science are in high demand, aero majors are always welcome to help improve the aero package. Obviously mechanical engineers are always useful everywhere. There is no shortage of opportunity for anyone and everyone, including non-engineering majors who can help on the business side of things. One of the great things about MRacing is that if you're unsure about which direction you want to go in with your major, we can help you decide. Tag along with one division for a while to get a feel of what its like and join another one if it doesn't float your boat.. . . . All of us are also big motorsports fans so you're in similar company there. We'd love to have you over at MRacing,but I do have to say that it is ultimately your choice. Since you're a freshman you can spend a semester or year at SolarCar and then come to MRacing if you want to, no such thing as joining too late.

I haven't been on Solar Car, so I can't know for sure that this is an issue, but the main reason I went with MRacing is that it seemed easier to get into as a new member. No application, no hours requirement, fewer members, and anecdotal experience did it for me. I think that's ended up being one of MRacing's strengths, as it took less than a semester for me to feel like a part of the team, both professionally and socially, and I wasn't necessarily anything special.. . One of the cooler aspects of MRacing is testing days, where you're basically chilling in a parking lot pushing the race car you built to its limit.

Also, after a year working on the car, you get to attend Team Drive Day and take a turn in the driver's seat, which for most people is the only opportunity they'll ever get to drive a real race car at speed.

My internship that I got sophomore year from career fair turned into an internship for after junior year which gave me the experience and confidence to get a job in the same field after senior year.. . You mentioned in a post below that you were hoping to get some realistic data. Well... a few years ago after accepting my full-time position I posted this on the engineeringstudents subreddit: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/80a1ra/i_got_the_job_here_are_some_stats_and_things_i/) . . . In my senior year, when looking for fulltime positions, I had a 44% positive rate (a non-no/non-ghost) from career fair companies. For things like Indeed, it was 5%. I spoke to 18 companies that year between fall and winter career fair, and had landed 4 interviews from that (8 had positive feedback such as passing resume to a hiring manager or requesting more info from me). I would aim to talk to 4-5 quality companies per day of career fair. That was a reasonable amount of companies for me to have spent 20ish minutes each on, applying online and looking at their website. It's anecdotal, but so many people I know ended up getting jobs at places they interned at after talking at career fair, or in the same field that they interned at from career fair.. . . Here's the data in that post to /r/EngineeringStudents https://imgur.com/a/xIQh7#8vLlbCX You can see from my small sample size was that I was drastically more successful with career fair companies. . . A general tip is to do all the obvious things so the recruiter can't waste time going over that.
