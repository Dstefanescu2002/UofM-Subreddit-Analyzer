The first half could be applicable to some interviews/leetcode problems, but the second half is pretty unlikely to be useful for such purposes. The workload is low (only ~6 homeworks, each about as long as EECS 376 homeworks but slightly more difficult), with an (allegedly optional) final project.

This is a big request -- why are we making it? First, if the U-M determines that we can conduct residential instruction there will still be those students who won't be comfortable attending classes on campus, such as because of underlying health conditions that increase risk. Second, we expect that there is a good chance that the novel corona virus will continue to circulate and that some students, faculty and staff will continue to get sick with COVID-19. In these cases, the likely response will be 14-day quarantine -- and quarantined students will still need to take courses and quarantined faculty will still need to teach.

Michigan's Engineering is top-notch and the IOE program is number 2 in the country. I have some bad news and some good news for your questions.. . Bad news, Ross a few years back changed the admissions process so most of the class comes in as a freshman pre-admit, not a sophomore transfer. You can still try to transfer as a sophomore, but it is much, much more difficult than it was in the past. Therefore, you can try your luck after a year transferring, but it's impossible to transfer to Ross before coming in as a freshman.. . So here's my advice. The BBA program in Ross is great, and many of the kids go on to do great stuff. No hate on the Ross kids at all. However, if you ever go to a recruiting event, you will notice that most of the BBAs will be pretty generic to recruiters, and only the ones who have done really outstanding stuff already or are part of really good clubs will get chosen most of the time. Again, not hating on them, just pointing out my anecdotes as well as the sentiment of some recruiters I've talked to. Here's where you come in. IOE teaches you a LOT of great basic skills business recruiters will like, like basic coding in many languages, which would be even better if you take EECS 280 (it's hard, but I recommend highly), database design and administration, optimization methods, and economic topics. If you are truly interested in business, and maybe joined a club or two, gained a little knowledge on your own, and even took a Ross class or two or three (I did this, you can do it for tech electives, general electives, or a minor), it actually makes you stand out more than the BBAs. I once heard someone say to me that Ross is really 80% recruiting and 20% work, while engineering is 80% work and 20% recruiting, and I would strongly agree with that. All of my friends I knew in Ross gained all their knowledge relevant to their jobs outside the classroom. So, my point is if you put in the work, it's not difficult to have the same skills and/or credentials as the BBAs, but you also have another great differentiator with the BSE degree in a highly relevant field.. . To sum it up, it's impossible to transfer to Ross before fall. You can apply freshman year for sophomore transfer, but don't bank on it. The engineering school is fantastic, and can actually be a great differentiator when applying to business jobs, as long as you put in the work.

And I don't think that the difficulty is unique to UMich, I think it's specific to being in a cutthroat STEM field at a top school. Consider that we have over a thousand declared CS majors (if I recall correctly; I can't seem to find the report where I got that number though) and that it's a really, really competitive field. I don't want to come off as though I'm acting like you're not good enough or anything like that, but they make those classes either excessively difficult or with a massive workload for a reason. They need to weed people out because the program is too big and the field is oversaturated and competitive.. . I also wholeheartedly believe this is additionally due to the generally competitive and/or weeder culture with STEM programs (particularly with the prereq classes like lower math courses, Orgo, EECS 280/203, etc) in general. If a lot of people are taking them and within EECS especially, need them to declare, they're going to make them difficult to get through. They want the program to have the students with the most stamina so that they're more likely to successfully complete the degree and move forward from UMich to do well in the field. Until UMich puts a cap on CS majors, the courses required to declare are going to have to be a nightmare in order to impose some limit on who can declare.. . This is all to say that I'm an English major, and I have not experienced any of this. None of my classes have had an excessive workload or unreasonable level of difficulty. I learn a ton in almost every class, the assignments are usually relevant, and our large projects are assigned with ample, sometimes excessive, time to complete. My classes also seldom fill up (with only 20-25 seats generally), have a comparatively tiny department, and are in a field where they really don't need to weed anybody out. When I took one, 100-level STEM class, I had my jaw dropped at a curve that equated a 90% to an A+.. . I think that it's just part of the culture of top STEM programs. I think that if you transfer to a lower-tier school, it might be easier, but if you're looking at a peer school in CS, I don't think it'll be much different.",27.0,neutral,0.7793969511985779

I'd agree in saying what you can do with an Econ degree is ambiguous (unless your plan is to do a doctorate), but the good thing is it really depends on how ambitious you are personally. This means that sky is the limit if you are determined in learning outside the classroom. . . You will be at a disadvantage in every regard vs people who graduate from an external business school or Ross when gunning after the banking sector. It all comes down to how well you build the capital between your ears and sell yourself.. . This is where UofMs Econ program struggles because it does not encourage taking the banking fundamentals (finance, accounting) which is CRUCIAL to doing well in interviews. If the answer you give is reversed off google the night before or you stumble trying to make things up They. Will. Know. You have to hungry to learn outside the classroom so you can nail those interview questions which have nothing to do with Econ 401 or 402 (you'll remember those classes your whole life FYI). . . Personally, you have to think about what you want to do and what would make you happy. You do not have to settle for anything and many people make that mistake out of college.

It's hard to explain over reddit, but what I am trying to say is put down everything electronic and a distraction and ask yourself ""what is it that I want to do and where do I see my best self working?"" regardless of having an Econ degree. It's a hard question to answer and many of us have no idea. However, when you start to think and put yourself on that mission of your best self, you'll find the place you truly fit and when you walk into that interview and you can confidently nail those technical questions and say to the interviewer ""This is the position I align with and here are the personal values I strive for everyday that your company incubates and encourages..."" you will kill it and it does not matter if you do not have a business related degree.. .

I'm actually a dual degree in Ross and CS right now (will be senior next year), and I wish I dropped before RIS (junior year) because I absolutely love CS and I've grown the hate the Ross curriculum. Sorry, not gonna really add to the discussion here, just kinda venting cuz I think about this stuff a lot. I'd recommend to anyone who is drawn to Ross for the prestige or vague idea of working in business to reconsider pursuing it based on their actual interests. Like you said, the BBA is a recruiting tool, primarily for consulting or banking, and unless that's what you want to do with it, the BBA won't be as valuable as pursuing a different degree in a field you love. And even if you wanted to do something like banking or consulting, I'd even suggest opting to do a business minor instead to gain some recruiting perks while pursuing a different degree to make you stand out. Despite the negative feelings I have towards Ross, there are some great experiences I've had. Specifically, the short term study abroad programs are fantastic, and best thing about them is that they're open to anyone at UM; however, I doubt would've looked into them if I wasn't in Ross, so I'm at least grateful for those experiences. I've also met some good people here and there (Ross gets a bad reputation for the snake culture, which definitely exists, but I've been distancing myself from the school this year and have avoided meeting scummy people). Yea kinda just late-night venting here, so don't know where I'm going, but overall, I think BBA degrees are overrated, and frankly, I don't think they justify a 4-year degree (harsh comment that requires more context and explanation, but maybe i'm just being neurotic). I truly think that every subfield of Business encompassed in Ross would be better off as a concentrated minor except Accounting; I think Accounting is the only field that justifies a full Bachelor's degree.

I'm definitely biased by STEM fields probably tend toward the higher workloads/difficulty, but I don't think any except a few majors are really *light*. Another thing to consider is the ""in-class"" vs. ""out of class"" commitments you might have. CS students spend a ton of time on their projects for class, while Ross students don't spend nearly as much time on class work as they do consulting clubs and other student orgs.. . 2. It's pretty tough I think. Ross has shifted toward like 80% pre-admission, but cross-campus transfers are not impossible. I'll definitely let someone in Ross give you better advice here.. . 3. Again, don't know much in this area. I will say that personally I have relied on my peers and their experiences more than University services (e.g. a recently graduated friend over the Engineering Career Resource Center).. . 4. (I'll combine with 5. because these have a pretty similar answer) I think Michigan does a great job of balancing its different areas of student body. Greek life is pretty big (like 1/6 of all students are in Greek life maybe?), but if you want nothing to do with it you won't feel like you're missing out, you can still party or choose not to, etc. Sports culture is big - everyone goes tailgating/partying/drinking on football Saturdays (assuming they return in the fall rip) but you don't have to go to the game - for most people it's just about the social aspect. There's also plenty of room to explore, student sections like the hockey team's Children of Yost (greatest student section in the world by a mile) are super fun and fans get super into it. Can't really party in the dorms, but you can drink with friends if you're not obnoxious and your RA is chill. Mostly freshman year people go to frats - trying to fix your ratio before you go out so that you'll get in is a freshman rite of passage. There's definitely a nerdier side of student life if you're into that - there's so many design teams, student orgs, general interest clubs that you'll find a group of people with a common interest as you. I suggest checking out professional fraternities - most of them are very down to earth (e.g. no hazing, parties are chill) and you get a lot out of them in terms of your career, friends for life, etc. There's definitely aspects of student life I haven't covered, but I think the general consensus is that the UMich student body is diverse enough such that you can ""find your people"" and not worry too much about trying to fit in. Despite having like 50k students, finding your community of 25-100 is very easy and makes everything feel less lonely.. . 6. I like Ann Arbor a lot. I also prefer cities to college towns, but I feel that AA isn't lacking. There's good food everywhere, the UMMA is a top-tier art museum, we're close enough to Detroit that you can find a buddy with a car and catch whatever events you're looking for, and in the summer AA is very nice as the townies reclaim the city lmao. Not as lively or bustling as NYU for example, but personally I don't really have time to just hang out more than a few times a week thanks to school.. . 7. I kind of mentioned it before, but I think the balance of all the opportunities available is UMich's greatest strength. All the different corners of student life - sports, Greek life, academics, pfrats, cultural orgs, hobbies/clubs, DIY/music - are of a good enough size where you don't feel lost in such an incredibly large school, but are small enough where you aren't ""missing out"" by not being a part of them. People are generally chill enough where you can get along with anyone, especially if you're in a social setting, but also you find really passionate and amazing people pretty easily.

You will have time for clubs and free time as well.

There are always parties going on, but I never go because of the crowds and . the drinking, but if you like that sort of thing then there are plenty of opportunities.. . 5. All of my friends at UM are incredibly smart, humble, and all around good people. What . always surprises me is how smart some people are even though they don't act like it . when you are talking to them. Sports are definitely a large part of the culture here, but I . wouldn't say the campus life revolves around it. I have gone to 1 sports game my . entire time here and I don't feel like I'm missing out.. . 6. Ann Arbor is nice but most definitely a college town. Even though there is a downtown . area with lots of museums and art and stuff, if you want a real city, Ann Arbor is not . that. If you are just looking for stuff to do, then Ann Arbor has plenty of events.. . 7. I think Michigan is the perfect balance between good academics and good people. If I . went to a school with a lower acceptance rate, I think the people would be too snobbish . but if I went to a normal state school, the kids wouldn't care about school as much and . the quality of the education would be worse.

From that, I can conclude a couple pros and cons about north vs. central campus:North Pros:. . * Once you're done with the day, it actually feels like you're done. You head to your room from the classes, it feels like there's a clearer line between school and home.. * There's some cool resources in the duderstadt centre, esp if you're an engineer or in the arts programmes. There's also been a lot of effort to provide resources for kids who live north.. * The study spots in the north campus libraries tend to be less competitive for good seats, especially if you're creative. I'm assuming this might also apply to the gyms. . North Cons:. . * It can feel a bit alienating, it's not a popular place to RA in, so you might not always have someone who 100% gives a shit.. * You can get a bit stir crazy being on north campus, because it sometimes feels like you're far from everyone. * depending on how accustomed you are to public transportation, the bus system can feel frustrating to deal with. coming from a large city, i personally think it gets the job done, but that's not the same for everyone.. . Central Pros:. . * A lot of things to do, campus wise. you have less time needed to get to class.. * not having to deal with the vomit comet on weekends.. * generally all your classes and outside school events happen on central or off campus near central.. . Central Cons. . * study spots are more competitive.. * depending on what building you are, you have to deal with a lot of noise on weekends or late at night.. * If you're in art, theatre, or engineering, your classes might not all be on central except for a couple of electives.",6.0,neutral,0.8383473753929138

I definitely wouldn't recommend doing either more than one project team or doing research and a project team concurrently. Do what you enjoy! Try out a project team and see how you like it, and if you don't it isn't like you have to continue on with it. I joined a project team freshman year and didn't end up liking it too much, but I did enjoy consulting one of my friends on something he was working on for a different project team which I would've ended up joining if I hadn't gotten a research position by that point. There are many ways to getting research. I have a bunch of friends doing it through UROP which is a good option if you have no clue what you want to do. I personally emailed a bunch of professors I looked up on the mechanical engineering website and had to email the same professor three times before he responded and gave me an interview. What I'm getting at is definitely you want to be tenacious when seeking out either research or a project team and just honestly do what suits you because it's how much you contributed and the way that you can talk about it to a recruiter that really counts. . . Another word of advice is that you should really just try to enjoy as much of the free time you have also.

Your GPA is fantastic so I would definitely keep that up, and also make sure that for the transfer process if they require you to have certain classes completed (i.e. for internal UofM transfers we had to take a few prereqs before/while applying like SI 110 and SI 106), absolutely do all you can to 4.0 those classes it'll definitely help strengthen your academic argument for why you should be accepted into the BSI program.. . \- As for being involved, it sounds cliche and dumb but my advice would be to pursue things you're interested in and see how they can overlap with what the BSI program focuses on and teaches. So, using your pottery example, you can take that personal passion and apply it in a way that aligns with the BSI program (i.e. say you start using online design tools to start planning and mocking up pottery designs that you'd create and creating a digital planning workflow for the art you create, I think admissions would love that stuff. Or you could potentially do user research/a design case on various pottery tools and how you'd improve them/make them more accessible for others to use (i.e. I know some types of pottery use a foot pedal to control the ""pottery wheel"" and how fast that spins - that might not be accessible to someone who doesn't have proper motor control of their legs so designing (don't have to go as far as building) a new type of pedal to control this mechanic and writing up a user story/case study on that could be cool)).. . \- That being said, to my knowledge most people applying to the program don't really have a portfolio (maybe the top % of applicants who are interested in UX do, but the vast majority don't). So having a portfolio to begin with probably does set you apart, and I would encourage to now take the next step and make it a portfolio that goes above and beyond and places you in that ""top % of applicants"" group. . There are other things you can do but that level of advice is also dependent on your stiutaiton and resources that you have available + your interests. Feel free to pm me if you want to chat more and I'd be happy to help however I can :) I hope this helps you though (along with anyone else considering transferring into the BSI).. .

Something that worked really well for me personally was only taking one science class my first semester, so I had time to adjust to college lifestyle without burning out or tanking my science GPA. Best case scenario, you build awesome, generalizable skills for future coursework. Worst case scenario, you're a little bored but you have free time to get involved in extracurriculars. Then, slowly add on science classes. I promise you'll be able to get everything done by the earliest date you could apply to med school. . . Another method is to spread out your extracurriculars (volunteering, clinical experience, research) so that you don't do a lot at once. My pre-med friends who were overwhelmed were usually spreading themselves too thin by juggling part-time research, multiple volunteering gigs, and even a job. I got just as many valuable experiences by only doing one or two extracurricular activities at once. . . If you don't think the workload and requirements are worth the stress, I highly recommend exploring other career paths early.

She actually replied the day after with a long, point-by-point response to my email! Alas, by the time I saw it, the semester was over. This really set the tone for later mistakes.. . Second mistake: Taking things way too seriously. She just wanted to talk to me and get to know me and have fun, but I treated it like a job interview and really stressed myself out with a lot of self-inflicted pressure. Girls notice this.. . Third mistake: Sending her a long email at 4:00 am the night after I got hit by a drunk driver doing 110 mph, asking for a longer conversation. I was scared and in shock, but this should have waited for in-person. She didn't reply, and the next time we saw each other she said she had no intention of meeting outside of her work hours. A shame, because the night of the accident we had enjoyed our best chat yet, and were slowly building a bit of a rapport.. . Final mistake: Panicking after classes get canceled and I realize I won't see her again for six months, if ever. Then nailing my coffin by sending an extremely emotional and extremely long farewell email that got wayyyy too personal. She responded and told me not to speak with her again.. . So...ask her out if you get the chance, then literally do the opposite of everything I did after that step. If she's interested, just take it slow, have fun, and enjoy talking with her. Don't worry about the future until you actually figure out if you like each other. If she's a decent person, she will at least be kind to you.. .

I get the point you're making but having these credits absolutely is an advantage. I came from an affluent in-state school had a lot of AP credits and was able to register for classes earlier and graduate one semester early. One of my friends had so many credits that he came in one year after me but still graduated in the same time and always registered before me. He breezed through college. (Note you still have to be a competent student to do this, the AP credits just let you finish early or go at a slower pace). Another friend never took more than 10 credits per semester after sophomore year. This discrepancy is especially problematic in departments like EECS where course waitlists can be four times as large as the capacity.. . It's not a fair system and it needs to be fixed.

t1_foyfwy2,2020-04-29 14:50:00,t1_foxjoch,t3_ga4x75,"The official cutoff for ""free tuition"" is the $65K. The concern is that if you leave it at that, families who make $66K or above will think ""No aid for us"" which isn't true. Aid goes to families at a lot of different income levels.. . The additional statements about families making more than $65K are aimed at telling you that there is additional aid out there, and in fact some families with incomes up to $180,000 have qualified for aid. Did they qualify for aid that fully covers tuition? Maybe not, but they got aid that supports the cost of paying that tuition. . . For families above $65k, it still comes down to what you qualify for based on the aid application.. . Since what you were offered was lower than the average, this suggests that your family's overall financial picture may differ from that of the ""average"" family in that bracket. Aid really varies even for families with similar basic stats, because things like siblings and parental age and other assets come into play. Also, merit awards (which have nothing to do with income) add to some students' aid packages.. . Let me also address the idea that published averages are somehow ""optimistic."" There is some truth to that, but not because they're choosing fishy numbers, but because of how aid factors into student decision-making. Schools are asked to report average net cost for students at U-M--the ones who decided to enroll and accepted their aid offer. That's a different, smaller pool than the group you're in, (which is all admits who were sent an aid package). It's likely that the average of all the *offered* aid for your income range is lower than the $10K you calculated above. Why? What happens is, the admits with the best aid offers enrolled at a higher rate, while students who qualified for less enrolled at a lower rate. So when you calculate net cost for enrolled students in any income group, you're capturing admits who tended to get good aid offers. This would be true at every college, it's not fishy, it's how it's supposed to be reported. . . To illustrate, let's imagine three kids in the same income bracket who apply to UM. After applying the aid formula and merit scholarships, UM offers $13,000 in aid to Joe, 1,000 in aid to Hakeem, and $7,000 in aid to Betsy. Betsy and Joe enroll, but Hakeem has better offers and goes elsewhere. The average aid for Betsy and Joe is $10,000, which is what would be reported for their income group. But the average aid offered to all three of them (which is something that isn't calculated or published, but what would be useful to compare to if you're wondering what the average aid is that gets *offered* to a family in your bracket) is $7,000.",10.0,error,0.0

t1_fozpj6d,2020-04-29 21:10:14,t3_gaebok,t3_gaebok,"It honestly really depends on what major you pursue/what classes you take. I was in a similar situation in that my high school wasn't very rigorous (nor did it offer any AP) and I was able to graduate with a 3.9 essentially just going to class and submitting work on time. When it came to exams, I maybe put 2 hours per semester into studying, if even that... This did not bode well whatsoever when I entered UofM. I came in a pre-med student, and oh boy did some of those intro level natural science classes hit me like a truck. I realized I would quickly have to learn and maintain more disciplined study habits if I wanted to succeed. That being said, I also realized that despite my horrible habits, I was still performing well in a number of classes. Namely my social science and humanities courses. Now that I'm almost done with college, it's been a consistent reality that certain subjects have been significantly easier than others to perform well in. My math and science courses have required substantially more work to obtain an A than the vast majority of my other classes. In many cases, ensuring excellence on an exam for these science courses meant attending all lectures, taking diligent notes, reading through the textbook on my own time (although I was able to skip out on this in a few cases), and studying like crazy in the days leading up to the exam itself (sometimes 20+ hours). In many of my social science/humanities courses, getting an A simply meant showing up, chiming in once or twice during discussions, and sifting through readings enough to write a competent paper. A large portion of these courses didn't even have exams, and many of those that did required maybe an hour or two of studying and sometimes included generous extra credit opportunities. . . This disparity in course difficultly is readily apparent when you look at the average GPA breakdown by major. I don't personally have experience with Computer Science, but I know that the CS major GPA average is close to a 3.0, whereas the average for English majors hovers around a 3.5. University of Michigan makes use of a site called Atlas (Course Art? I don't know the exact name), and within that site you can find the grade distribution for courses across their last 10 semesters. This is an incredibly useful tool in determining how difficult a course will likely be. In my time here looking over hundreds of classes, I've found that social science courses frequently report a median grade of an A- or even A in many cases. In the instance of chemistry and physics courses, the median grade usually seems to be around a B. This trend of certain subjects being more difficult than others extends beyond a math and science vs. ""the rest"" pattern as well. A comparison of Spanish and German shows that throughout the 4 required language courses for LSA undergrads (101, 102, 231, 232), Spanish is consistently more demanding than German. At the 231 and 232 level where most students start here, Spanish sees a low B median grade, whereas German sees an A-/A median grade. Fewer than .1% of Spanish 232 students receive an A+, whereas over 10% of German 232 students receive an A+. If that's not a reflection of course difficultly/work required to maintain excellent grades, then I don't know what is.. . This has been incredibly long, I know. I'm going a bit crazy with all the boredom during this lockdown... I hope I've been able to provide a little insight, though! My tl;dr advice is that yes, UofM is generally far more demanding than many of our high school academic experiences, but that this increase in demand varies to a high degree across majors and subjects. Don't lose confidence in yourself if you perform poorly in an intro course or two.

Back when I was a student, there was kind of this general atmosphere where some types of ""cheating"" weren't seen as bad as some others. For example, things like copying down some math answers, loaning out iclickers, etc. were somewhat common. Note that I'm not defending this by any means, just what I observed. . . With that in mind, it was pretty understood that people wouldn't just copy essays or something. There was a difference between things that were just right or wrong compared to things like writing. . . My guess is a lot of new students see coding more akin to a problem that just has a solution, rather than the more accurate analogy of an essay, where every student's code is a unique way of solving the problem. So they copy and paste and don't realize how obvious it is. . . The final thing is that I think that EECS is particularly good at catching this sort of thing. My guess is that if other domains had the ability to check for cheating like EECS does, you would actually see a lot more cases of students getting caught. Thus, it's not that EECS is this cesspool of cheaters, but rather, kids just get caught more.",146.0,neutral,0.6819576025009155

I hope that you'll be able to celebrate what you've accomplished at Michigan even if it isn't exactly the ending you planned or hoped for. Thinking about unusual graduations, [last year I shared this photo from 2008 when commencement was on the diag.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/bjw8nv/throwback_thursday_2008_commencement_on_the_diag/). . This is definitely a very different Michigan Stadium than what you're used to seeing. In 1950 the capacity was around 97,000. The house inside the gates was the one remaining house from the property purchased to build the stadium. U-M purchased farm land from the Miller family [in addition to over 100 mostly vacant lots](https://annarborobserver.com/articles/the_big_house_diaspora.html#.XqmRPahKjIV) from other owners (though there were some houses that were moved or demolished). The Miller farm house inside the gates became the house for the Michigan Stadium groundskeeper/caretaker. . . Even though Michigan Stadium went from natural grass to turf in the late 60s, the house remained. I wasn't able to nail down exactly when it was removed but my best guess is in the late 80s or early 90s. It is visible in this [photo from 1984](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhl/x-bl017661/bl017661) but [no longer there in 1995.](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhl/x-bl014190/bl014190). . If you're interested in learning more about the history of the stadium there is a book *The Big House: Fielding H. Yost and the Building of Michigan Stadium* by Robert Soderstrom that is very well researched. . . Some other notable things about the photo:. . * There doesn't appear to be an outfield fence at the baseball stadium but instead a long row of tennis courts in right and center field. There is no softball field, softball did not become a varsity sport until 1978.. . * The south grandstands are still up at Ferry Field, the place Michigan played football until 1927 when Michigan Stadium opened. There had previously been a larger grandstand on the north side but that was [torn down in 1926 to make way for the IM Building](https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/stadium/stadtext/ferry.htm). . * There was a ball bearings factory where many of U-M's administrative and facilities offices are now located.. . * There is no Crisler Center, that wasn't built until 1967.

t1_fp2z2ds,2020-04-30 18:11:36,t3_gaftkd,t3_gaftkd,"So I was a premed who switched to Com Sci, and I can say that both tracks are hard, but for different reasons.. . Premed is mostly just rote memorization. Outside of classes like Chem 210 (Orgo I), the vast majority of your premed career would be focused on memorizing a significant amount of information for the exams and keeping an impeccable GPA all while developing a set of useful extra-curriculars that can prepare you for med school. To that extent, I find much of the studying for premed to be a solitary experience. Certainly, I'm not saying you can't study with friends, but you could still do sufficiently well memorizing by yourself and not coming into contact with others. The real theme of premed is just drive and dedication. If you don't come into it with that sort of determination, you probably won't have the motivation to go through all the tedious minutiae required and will have trouble getting into med school.. . By comparison, rote memorization is something that really just doesn't function well in CS. To flourish well in CS, you'll need to firmly understand the concepts and then be expected to apply them. Much of CS develops as a mix of projects and exams - with many projects being an opportunity to collaborate with other students and further your understanding of the material, while also working as an avenue to develop potential study partners with for the exams. While this sounds good on paper, CS is just quite simply conceptually hard. Many classes have exam averages of 60%-50%, but the flip side is that you don't have to care much about your GPA, because at the end of the day you're selling yourself to companies and not med schools. All companies really care about is whether you have the skills necessary - not about how high your grade is. This means that Com Sci also has its own share of small annoying stuff you have to do in to interview for a job, but overall I'd say the tedious preparation bs is significantly smaller compared to Premed.. . To summarize, I'd say that the workloads of both are pretty similar. In either route, you'll have a significant amount of stress you'd deal with, but the forms that these stresses take differ. If you're planning on making a decision, I'd say personal skills, interest, and **drive** really come down in determining whether you'll succeed in one or the other.",1.0,neutral,0.6116076111793518

Really big: as a CS major, I definitely get where you are coming from. None of the CS professors I've had know my name (granted, I didn't really do much to reach out -- but the gist is you might have to make a more deliberate effort to be known by your teachers at Mich than at Notre Dame, where it might happen more organically). I'm not 100% sure about the aero department though. It's a big 10 school, if you choose to come here that's what your signing up for and I think the size of the school (and consequently of the alumni network) can be huge advantages if you make the most of it. 2. North Campus: I'm in the college of engineering, but my freshman year, I lived on central campus and I only took 1 class on North Campus (although since it was a CS class with recorded lectures, I stopped showing up once the weather got cold and just watched it from the comfort of my dorm at 2x speed). But the general point is that in your first year you'll probably be taking a lot of general requirements which can be done on central, and from what I've heard from older engineering friends your schedule doesn't really get north-heavy until sophomore year and beyond. You don't have to worry about this yet -- as a first year, try your best to get central housing.. 3. Frats: FWIW, the vast majority of Michigan students are not in greek life. For most students, the people they meet in student orgs/clubs/activities end up becoming their best friends for the next four years. There is definitely a lot to do socially outside of greek life, although to be fair I think answers on reddit generally underestimate how much frats are perceived to dominate social life at Michigan. The key though is it's mostly just perception, and you can have a great social experience without touching greek life at all too.. 4. Harder to switch major: not sure where you heard this from, Michigan is actually one of the most flexible schools major wise. That partly leads to your next con, though, which is. 5. Harder to get desired classes: since anybody can declare a major once they meet the minimum requirements (which are rather generous compared to other schools -- for instance, to declare CS you need a \~C average in the intro classes compared to Cal where you need like an A-), some majors are pretty crowded and it can be hard to get into upper-level classes. I think this is mostly an EECS problem though and aerospace isn't as affected by this. Also, since registration priority is determined by the # of credits you have, if you're coming in with a bunch of AP credits, you'll be at an advantage for registration.. . Hope this helps!",1.0,error,0.0

t1_fp4lquu,2020-05-01 02:57:13,t3_gb9ejd,t3_gb9ejd,"Gonna tell you right now as a current aerospace student in UM, the Aerospace department is pretty small compared to other engineering departments. Yeh the school is gigantic, but in reality you tend to interact with the same 100 or so people in your grade throughout aerospace as the classes everyone takes to get an AE degree is pretty much the same. You also get to know your profs pretty well since there's only really 20 or so lecturing in total. Also notable is the fact that the Aerospace Depart is separate from the ME department, unlike Notre Dame, so you get your own building, and most importantly, more funding for teaching and research. . . Being a massive school has its downsides, but it also has its upsides. Mainly more opportunities. Our career fair is massive, and the Michigan name brand alone holds a shitton of weight in the Aerospace Industry. SpaceX, Blue Origin, Boeing, and other major companies will look at your resume over other engineering schools solely because our Aerospace Program ranks in the top 5 of the nation. Notre Dame is good, but aerospace isn't it's main strong suit in engineering. . . Our engineering student orgs are far larger, better funded, and are more recognizable than Notre Dame. To a prospective student these extraciriculars probably don't sound too important, but trust me, the only reason you'll land an internship is real world experience, and nothing gets you that faster than a design team.

Their students may be going part time while pursuing an outside job and/or caring for their children or parents. Their students may be focused on majors that will fulfill local workforce needs. All of those factors drive the majors, programs, services, and campus features they offer--and it's not just about meeting the specific needs of their students, but also in holding down costs for affordability (recognizing that their students may not have ability or interest to pay for co-curriculars and services and electives they can't take advantage of). . . This doesn't mean that they are lesser institutions. The state (and nation) absolutely needs colleges that pursue the critical mission that Flint and Dearborn do--that's why there are so many of them.

It's not really sensible to compare the Ann Arbor, Flint, and Dearborn branches in the way that people keep doing. . . And same goes for their funding.

Also where applicable (most notable 280, 281, 370) think of edge cases and submit them early as your number of submits are limited and making edge cases are not hard but are important to understanding difficulties that might show up later when you start programming. . . Also other things would be to spend a consistent amount of time working on the projects instead of 2-3 days of overworking yourself since a lot of CS projects' difficulty comes from planning and understanding the problem rather than how to implement it (tho some projects it may be difficult to program in due to a language/library restriction, tho spreading the time out for learning a library/language is also a way better option). Another thing is to always check piazza as many people ask questions that are very relevant to your own problems.

That being said, I would HIGHLY recommend getting a cash management account instead like Sofi Money or Aspiration. You can use any ATM in the world, including any from any bank on campus, with all fees reimbursed and the interest rate is orders of magnitudes higher than the banks. The banks on campus tend to have buggy apps and bad customer service. I used to have a couple bank accounts and decided to switch and the experience and interest is 100% better than the banks.. 2. Your MCard is your ID card. You use it to get into buildings like dorms and libraries after hours, it has your student ID number and uniqname on it. Blue bucks are the sort of campus currency that are uploaded onto your MCard. They do not offer you discounts or special privileges anywhere so I would highly recommend against getting any vs just using a normal debit/credit card as they are obviously more useful. Dining dollars are kinda similar, except you buy them in advance with a meal plan and get a slight discount on them, their only benefit (For example pay $175 to get $200 in dining dollars).. 3.

It's not what I expected based on my major at all, and there are certainly some downsides from college, but it's not bad. I have a stable well-paying job, even if I lucked into it.. I'm about to sound super pretentious, but I feel like a lot has changed since I've graduated. Overall, here are my pluses and minuses a year out:. . Pluses:. . \-Finally being able to settle down a bit with my partner was great. We were long distance at UMich and it always felt weird having to do college and put my relationship on hold. We live together now, and I love it.. . \-Having more money is certainly nice, especially when it comes to things like grocery shopping or eating out. I enjoy eating brie, ya know?. . \-You can still do fun young people stuff as an alum. As a young alum, it's not weird to go party or any other young person thing you used to enjoy. You're still basically the same age even if it feels different. Realizing that made me a lot happier.. . \-it's honestly a lot less stressful. At least for me, professional life doesn't feel anywhere near as life-or-death, crying in bed, and just emotionally raw as many people experience in college. Like, I want to do well at my job, but there aren't really big successes and failures in the same way.. . \-If this is important to you, you finally get to settle down in a new hometown and start to build a life. You're not still ""waiting"" for what you'll do, you actually get to go do it. This can bring a sense of purpose and fulfillment.. . Minuses:. . \-Having a 9 to 5 gives you a LOT less free time than you think. Luckily, I work at a school and still get breaks, but it's WEIRD to not have tons of independent time and to be at work 8 hours a day, every day. You can't plan trips in the same way, it's just different.. . \-Similarly, if you're an adventurous type, it can feel boring. You now don't have lots of umich people trying to get you into fun clubs and activities. If you want to try something new, you have to go out there and fucking do it.. . \-It's really hard to make friends in a lot of places, especially if your coworkers aren't your age. Unless you seek out friends, you won't find them.. . \-Depending on what you do, it can feel as though you wasted your potential, missed your opportunity, particularly if you're not in grad school.

My job is straightforward and a pretty strict 40 hr/week. So when I walk out of the office, I'm done. No worrying about next weeks test or the looming homework I could be doing instead of hanging with friends or balancing schedules meetings for clubs or whatever. . . I live in a house with a couple friends I've known for a while, so life in the house is similar to college except our house is much nicer and we have money to drink better booze and do cooler stuff, because jobs. Those also lend us being cleaner, quieter, etc. so there isn't roommate conflict, but we are all fully capable of clowning around as much as we want. We still host and go to house parties, still go bar hop with groups of friends, still do whatever degenerate stuff, but it's more Friday/Saturday and less Tuesdays lol. . . Having real jobs making real money is the biggest change for me, and most of the people I hangout with. Weekend trips to other cities and just getting hotels or AirBnBs with a group weren't an option on a college budget, but it's something we do regularly (outside of COVID times of course). Spur of the moment concerts or planning ahead for major artists happens way more. Casual sporting events are no big deal, though I certainly miss student sections. . . That said, making friends can definitely be a challenge in some places, finding things to do is definitely harder than walking around festifall and signing up for clubs, and it's generally a less intense commitment when you do find a new hobby, which is good and bad. So social life can be an adjustment, but it's not always as different as you might think. . . Personal growth doesn't stop just because you're not fully in a formal learning environment. You learn a ton while working, and many jobs require you to put in extra effort to pick up new skills/certifications/training/etc. Putting in work to get a promotion or be competitive for a future career move keeps you moving and growing. I also have more time to follow personal hobbies, attend cultural events, go to museums, business receptions, and I'm in better shape because I'm on a consistent gym schedule and I eat better. . . In general, it's different, but I think it mostly changes in the ways you want it to. I'm not settling down and grinding out the next 40 years till I retire, but I also have more structure than I did before, which is good for me. And as much as college feels like you're entirely on your own, the university is such a massive part of your life, that stepping out from that support structure frees up a lot to do whatever you want with your life. . .

I have friends at UCLA who ""look down"" on the other non-Berkley UC's. And that's in light of the fact that Davis, Santa Barbara, etc. are notably more reputable institutions than Dearborn or Flint. . . University of Michigan is also somewhat unique in that usually state universities with multiple campuses refer to even their flagship campus as University of X - ABC. Think about UNC. Most of us know of UNC - Chapel Hill, but outside of people from North Carolina, I doubt anyone even knows about any of UNC's *sixteen* other campuses. Then you have UofM, where we don't have to say ""- Ann Arbor."" Everyone just knows what's being referred to when they hear ""University of Michigan."" Our flagship school literally is The University of Michigan. . . This is largely due to the fact that -- as has been said here -- Dearborn and Flint were established much, much later than Ann Arbor. Approximately 140 years later. And in their far shorter lifespans, neither Dearborn nor Flint have established themselves as premier research institutions. From a resource standpoint, both Dearborn and Flint have endowments less than 1% of the size of Ann Arbor's. And the fact that Dearborn and Flint are commuter campuses with the vast majority of students living off campus gives the schools less of a ""traditional state university"" vibe. That coupled with lower division sports teams doesn't help cultivate ""school spirit"" (Though I personally don't think school spirit should influence a school's reputation, especially from an academic/prestige standpoint).. .

t1_fp95h31,2020-05-02 10:24:56,t3_gbo3po,t3_gbo3po,". . TL:DR -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. . I think a hybrid semester will create a divide between students who opt to stay home and take classes online and students who are on campus. I think dividing professors attention between the two groups will degrade the education level for everyone, but likely with students at home getting less attention/quality resources from faculty AND on campus students possibly being forced online anyways and getting screwed for having to pay for housing. Also professors are then put under the stress of having to figure out how to teach effectively both groups of students instead of focusing on teaching through just one type of format. . . The rest of this post is stream of conscious but its Reddit. . . \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. . Well we don't know what the situation will be like come fall term. However, I don't really see how a hybrid semester would work well. . . I mean if we still have to maintain six feet apart from everyone (assuming they don't up the distance requirement, with the CDC, etc floating ideas of raising the distance up to 9 feet or so), that massively cuts down on the capacity size of lectures. Like in order for a hybrid semester to work, in popular classes at least half the students MUST be opt in for online only in lecture. We could face the issue were students will be told they can't attend lecture in person because it would cause capacity issues. (Keep in mind that UofM is notoriously bad at allocate class space. Classes are always struggling to find room availability minus the pandemic). . So some students would get screwed out of in person classes, which could be their deciding factor for taking classes next semester. . . Can we talk about housing? How does a hybrid semester work for some students that opt to be on campus and those that opt to stay at home and take classes online to save money for housing. Now there's this divide between students on and off campus. Those that put the money to stay on campus will expect more of an in person experience. So they could get screwed if their forced to do stuff online they were hoping to in person because of capacity issues etc mentioned above. . . How would OH works? How will Professors divide between In-person and online OHs? The first scenario is A). They just host all of them online which sucks for people who forked over money to be on campus or B). They do hybrid OH wherein they either do separate OH for online and in person or they try to combine both. Maybe 10-20% of professors pull it off so that everyone gets what they need, but lets be honest, those who are here in person will get more time and attention. So those who stayed at home get screwed by less attention from professors. Not to mention already getting mega screwed by having to take classes online period from a faculty who isn't really geared for teaching online. . . ALSO online classes suck period, they're horrible. Not even considering lab based classes. . . I imagine resentment and ill-feelings will only brew between students in the same classes along the online/in-person line. . . Also, I don't envy the Professors position. Do they get to choice whether or not classes will have some attendance or not? A lot of those guys and gals ain't exactly young chief. A lot of them also have research they need to get done on top of all this stuff. Their attention is now divided not just between teaching/research now, its between teaching-inperson/teaching online/research. I know there is a lot of overlap between online-teaching/in person teaching but like, there is a non-trivial difference between them. If professors have to do both, that's at least like an extra five hours of work in a week on top of an already full work schedule.. . Idk, I see a lot of possible issues and I don't have a lot of confidence in the University to efficiently and pro-actively deal with them. . . Finally, I hope we don't get screwed tuition wise to make up for sunk doming/athletic tickets costs or wherever else the University is gonna loose money next semester. Seriously, if there was ever a time to dip into the principal fund of the endowment (which I know they're not really suppose to do), now's the time. I feel like donors to the University will recognize that like we're in crisis mode now and that their funds can be reallocated to keeping the University running in the pandemic without price gouging students (more than they already are).",0.0,error,0.0
t1_fp969om,2020-05-02 10:39:22,t3_gbdxt0,t3_gbdxt0,"Okay, so I see it recommended here, but I want to also suggest Latin. For context, I just finished my language requirement with Spanish 232. I took 4 years of Spanish and 3 years of Latin in high school. There is overlap between Latin and your other romance languages, but a heavy distinction is Latin's focus on translation and history. Latin is so much less focused on speaking and listening (with some classes basically requiring none of that), and is far, far more focused with both writing and understanding writing. Add to this that a lot of the texts that you translate are actual, historical accounts or retellings of major events. For this reason, Latin has always been so interesting to me as a subject and so genuinely fun to learn. Even difficult sentences that require a deep knowledge of the language are fun to parse out, because at the end you're left with a kickass quote from a Roman legionary. . . I ended up taking Spanish because despite enjoying Latin more, I wanted to learn a language that could be applicable in my career, but if that doesn't concern you too much, Latin is really awesome.

The cool thing is how many different majors LSA offers so there are tons she might be interested in. I'd highly recommend checking out the list. That said, for her I'd recommend:. . **Communications:** this major is all about mass media and majors often go into journalism, PR, social media or marketing. . **Creative Writing-Literature:** this is a good major for someone who loves storytelling. You can focus on a particular type of creative writing. Career paths include writing, editing and publishing.. . **PITE:** PITE has some STEM involved but it's more of an environmental social science major. It's good for people who are interested in environmental policy, outreach or nonprofit development.. . **Psychology:** there are a lot of different ways you can go with this one. Psych people often go into clinical psych, social work, HR and nonprofit/community development.. . **International studies:** there are four different paths on this one, so the career outcomes can vary a lot (two of them focus on international relations, one on comparative culture and the other on global environment) but it's a cool interdisciplinary social science major especially if she's interested in going abroad or learning a language.. . **American culture:** American culture is the study of various American cultural identities and their influence on society. A lot of the classes are really interesting. Most people who do this double major based on what they're interested in doing with it.. . There are also tons of minors she might be interested in. For instance if she's into blogging she might like the writing minor, where you take writing classes and create a digital writing project your senior year.. . I will also say, the advice I have always gotten is, don't go to grad school unless you want to. In my experience, the only non-STEM LSA people who need to go to grad school to get a job are those who want to do law school, those who want to go into academia, or those whose preferred job requires a master's (like social work). If you're in a more professional field like writing, media/PR, marketing or something political, grad school is an extra cost you probably don't need.. . ETA: Also, most LSA social science and humanities majors don't require that many credits so it's pretty easy to get a double major if you're interested in a lot of things.",3.0,positive,0.9420586228370667

I had such a blast in college and had a hard time adjusting to a new city where I knew no one and where the culture was so different than at Michigan. I was pretty homesick for campus, I missed my friends and had FOMO a lot, and it was like the first real time experiencing loneliness of this magnitude. So honestly, the first 6 months out sucked.. . But once I made genuine efforts to establish Boston as my new home and opened myself up to new people, life after college became so liberating. It's harder to make friends because you won't have access to as many people consistently like you did in undergrad, but things like roommates, coworkers, and joining some type of interest group that meets regularly helps to make friends. If you're working, it's cool having a job where at the end of the day you're done and the work is over. The reality of college for me is that while I had fun, I always had massive amounts of work and was under insane amounts of stress the majority of the time I was there. Getting to go home and know my day is done is so relieving. And it's SO nice to have money to afford things, save, and travel and visit friends! . . I think one of the best things about life post-grad is that your life really can look any way you want and it's so cool to be able to decide that for yourself. You start to learn what you truly care about and value without having an ""agenda"" from your college or your friends lowkey dictating what sorts of things you should be about. You may find out hobbies that you are passionate about that absolutely none of your college friends have. I realized I have a passion for studying Korean language and culture and it's important for me to have travel as a huge part of my life. The sky is truly the limit post-grad, and when you look back at the life you're able to build for yourself, it's a really dope moment.. . While the 4 years I spent in college were some of the most amazing years, I think that life after graduation has the potential to be better because the options are far more endless. I've had some really dope experiences, met some close friends, and have had so much formative growth beyond my days in school, so I'm happy where I'm at and wouldn't go back to college. So basically, don't worry. As long as you're open to a new normal potentially different from the one you had in college and embrace this new freedom, your post-grad life can be incredible.",5.0,error,0.0

Now, I've instituted a 13-credit limit (as of Fall 2019) on myself as a transferred LSA social science/humanities major, I have severely limited hours at my two jobs (not the same ones as freshman year), I just had my 4th psychiatric inpatient hospitalization at the end of April in the past 3 years, and was somehow only recently diagnosed with BPD during that hospitalization. . .

t1_fpetxcv,2020-05-04 01:14:18,t1_fpedn8q,t3_gcyvsa,"Thank you for reading!. . You've posed an excellent query, and while I can't claim *any* expertise in education or sociology, I have given some thought to this. I'd be curious to hear yours.. . \- Most schools cater to the middle, and it's understandable to an extent. I don't think it much matters which side of the bell curve you fall on; once you start getting a couple standard deviations or more away from the mean on *either side*, it becomes a question of resource allocation. How much resources are you willing to invest for the top or bottom 5% of students whose academic needs may differ markedly from their peers?. . \- Schools systematically emphasize rote memorization over critical thinking. Most of my high school courses consisted of the dispensation of facts from a teacher, who then asked students to regurgitate said facts, whether via exams or quizzes or essays. Outside of my language and math and (some) science courses, I can't think of any real exceptions. Whether it was history or economics or english or biology, it didn't much matter. Well, STEM courses in college aren't remotely like this, and it's a hard adjustment for some. Not all high schools are like this, of course. But mine certainly was: a slightly-above-average (based on standardized test scores) high school located in the rural white suburbs. I was extremely fortunate to also attend a dedicated STEM high school for half of my classes; said school selected from a pool of local students from various public schools, who then would split their time between their home school and the center. If nor for the center, I would've had access to literally one AP course.. . \- Students from less affluent families can't afford the opportunities that may present themselves. Whether it's private school or whatever. For example, I took the SAT in 7th grade, and I didn't even know what it was or why I was taking it. Scored 81st percentile, which would be sufficient to gain admittance to a lot of universities. As a consequence, I was offered a slot in a local program which allowed middle school students to take courses at Western Michigan University. Unfortunately, said program proved prohibitively expensive, and my parents couldn't afford it. I'm being serious when I wish that I could've gone straight to college after high school; I was certainly capable at the time. In high school, I completely stagnated and lost interest in school because it was so boring. About my only great memory is playing football. Four extremely imperative years for cognitive development, and in my case they were largely wasted (much of it my fault, of course). How many other students sleepwalk through high school because it fails to engage them?. . \- To return to my second point: Is our educational system designed to produce worker drones for factories and office jobs, or an engaged, passionate citizenry capable of critical thought and reflection? I've seen the argument advanced that the former is *precisely* the case in the US. Think about it. You're largely judged in primary school for your ability to follow orders and directions. Non-conformity is largely punished. Not only are you expected to give a specific answer to any question, you're also expected to adhere to one specific method for arriving at said answer. Is this environment conducive to creativity?. . I had a great technology teacher in high school who worked as an engineer for 20 years, then retrained to enter education. I've long wanted to follow a similar career path, and I've grown even more passionate after my experiences at college. I believe there's a better way for us to approach education in America, and we need to start the discussion. Thanks for listening to my TED talk. (:",16.0,error,0.0

Such things cannot happen if we continue to live in the quarantine bubble so we'll at some point have to get out and get sick (preferably once protocols and drugs are in place to remove the life threat) so this thing can be normal again.

This was in October pretty much right after the drop/add deadline, and I was too stubborn and prideful (plus parental pressures...) to withdraw from the semester. I ended up getting two C's and failing what should have been an easy English 100 level course. My GPA was atrocious and I felt so horrible about myself. I had a tough second semester as well, but starting the following year I pushed away those negative thoughts as best as I could and got back on the horse. Since then the lowest grades I received were two B's. Everything else has been an A- or higher. Watching my GPA tick up so slowly each time final grades got inputted was so demoralizing but I was determined to keep going. Now, I'm graduating with a 3.5 BS in BCN.. .

t1_fpg8ayi,2020-05-04 12:56:12,t3_gd6bt6,t3_gd6bt6,"1. Unless this changed since Fall 18, they usually set up your first semester as an engineer as 1 coding class, 1 math class, 1 science class. In your situation, the coding class will be ENGR 101 or ENGR 151 if you choose to take it (I wouldn't if you don't have coding experience - won't really affect you imo!), and the math and science classes will be based on which AP math and science credits you enter with. So this will probably be 12-14 credits unless you decide to stray from this format a bit, but this is explicitly how they structure it at orientation. You will most likely have time for a social life unless your science and math classes are REALLY hard (Physics 240 and Diff Eq or something like that). . 2. The short answer is yes. Its absolutely possible to maintain a high GPA with little coding experience. That being said, there is definitely an advantage in the earliest CS classes to those who have lots of coding experience, but I feel that by around EECS 281 and definitely by some of the ULCS classes it levels out more.. . 3. I didn't apply for any living communities but I want to say yes for this one. You do find out about MLC results well before housing assignments are released so if you and your roommate both get accepted you might want to reach out to someone about keeping that roommate selection, but I'm not 100% sure.. . 4. From what I understand, they're pretty competitive but not impossibly hard to get into. UROP you can always have multiple chances to get into, plus if you wanna do research just emailing your professors can work really well.. . 5. You can do that as a CoE major but I believe you would need to fulfill course requirements for both LSA and CoE. That means languages and some other humanities + electives stuff in addition to your CoE requirements. If you know that this is something you want to pursue, you may want to consider transferring to LSA and taking CS there (the education is the same and CS-LSA vs CS-CoE does not matter to employers at all). If you really want to stay in CoE then you can freely minor in Math through LSA without having to fulfill the LSA requirements.. . Hope this is helpful!",5.0,neutral,0.8749081492424011

With that established, the burgeoning size of Michigan's CS program was certainly a problem in terms of upper level classes over enrolling until they made the 2.5 GPA requirement for LSA students, since everyone and their mother were scraping through with a C and getting away with it. They've also enacted the restricted Enrollment policy, which is equitable in that it gives people a chance to get into in-demand courses by letting students choose only 2 restricted courses irrespective of registration date within the initial period, to prevent hoarding/first mover advantage.

It's more like implementing a classifier and writing up an analysis of why it works as it does and what would be the tradeoffs with different implementations. Because of this time commitment for 445 projects can vary widely but I'd say I spent a bit more time on 445 than I did for 281.. .

Let me say this: I have never failed a CS course (done very well in all of them) and there are a lot of deserving and competent CS-LSA students, but by and large I think the CS-Eng students seem to have an academic/intellectual edge because they are filtered through a more strict application microscope given CoE's slightly more exalted status in terms of academic quality.. . Now, imagine if every kid in LSA didn't have the ability to give the finger to the admissions department and have a workaround like being an engineer without having to apply to be an engineer. CS-LSA kinda enables this. If you got rid of CS-LSA majors, you can start filtering out some of the waaaaaay too many CS students simply by saying no at admission time, not using weeder classes with enhanced weeding. What if LSA kids want to do CS? Make em apply for a cross-campus transfer to CoE and decide if they should be allowed to. A kid who gets denied a cross-campus transfer is going to be upset, sure, but it's better than listening to them gripe about how unnecessarily difficult 203 is (which is true). 203/280 are the only CS classes I've taken that seem to hold disdain for their students.

In addition, I imagine the reason why Ross doesn't allow transfers across campus is because of the very strict scheduling that it partakes in in order to create cohorts of students, which means you can't just take classes whenever, which complicates transferring. In addition, Ross classes are super full. Every seat in classes are usually spoken for if they're core classes. I imagine Ross admits as many as they possibly can, and allowing transferring would just create more of a headache than it would be worth.

You probably won't enjoy your career and then you'll be unhappy in a job you don't like for the sake of a bit of financial security.

I'm an econ major myself, so I definitely know where you're coming from with the ""STEM or die"" mentality. . . But I can promise you that it is not true. Yes, STEM is absolutely a growing field with a lot of money and opportunity. But it's not the only one! Liberal arts majors have skills that STEM majors don't have -- things like communication and broad analytical skills. I settled on econ because it's fairly broad in its applications -- econ majors have success in business, finance, government, consulting, and so much more. And it still teaches strong quantitative skills! The idea that econ majors are Ross rejects, while true *sometimes,* is certainly not universal, because there are so many other applications of econ that you can't get from Ross. I can promise you that choosing econ will not make you poor :) . . In the end, you have to think about if you'll be happy twenty years from now with the decision you've made. If you like econ more than STEM, you'll probably be happier in econ than in STEM. And you can always develop and market STEM-adjacent skills with a minor or even just a few mathy classes. I know the university just added a ""quantitative methods in the social sciences"" minor, so that might be something you could look at. . . Good luck, I know it's a stressful choice.

If you're worried financially, my buddies who studied Econ make plenty of money and live in cooler cities and do jobs that seem way more fun than their comp sci peers. If you network well you can easily get a job making 70-80k out of college in a nice town. Also Econ is a pretty high paying industry in general with a Umich degree, here's a website to compare majors with starting salary: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?170976-University-of-Michigan-Ann-Arbor. . If you wanna make the most money, I'll parrot the other posters and tell you its not too late to switch to Ross (this will be easier if you're a poc/woman/Michigan resident) If you study finance you'll make more money than compsci majors, especially with a background in software! I have friends making starting salaries of 150k who studied finance. They are also on the clock 24/7. If you don't get in to Ross you can always be a business analyst with an economics degree and do a little business & a little computer stuff and make great money.. . Final tip: network network network. You ever heard the phrase it's who you know not what you know? It's true. If you network like hell you'll be just fine.

t1_fprugat,2020-05-07 14:37:40,t1_fpqwfok,t3_geflf1,"(sorry for the novel) Well, I took 183 first semester thinking I was destined to be a CS god. Fast forward 3 months, I fucking SUCKED at it, it just didn't make sense no matter how many hours I spent crying in office hours literally 4/5 days of the week EVERY WEEK. (pls don't make fun of me CS majors, I get it, I am inferior). Finally dropped it and felt the weight of the world leave my shoulders. For some reason I thought Econ would be good even though I am terrible at math and had never taken Econ.. . Fast forward to the end of that semester, I got a C+ in Econ 101. I literally thought I was the spawn of satan for getting a C+ in a class that I knew nothing about before taking it. I also felt bad about having a W from the last semester, I was like ""My grades suck, I am trash, I'll never be hired"" Looking back, it's not a big deal at all and funny that I was being so fucking dramatic. . . ANYWAY. So, now I am a rising junior, declared Econ and German as a double major. At the end of the day? I was miserable in CS and knew I wasn't going to enjoy the next 4 years (or the rest of my entire life) if I forced myself to do it just because computer scientists make a lot of money. I was surprised by how interesting I found Econ after taking more classes (102, 340, 401) and I'll be completely honest, I am still not great at math and I still struggle a bit in the classes but at least I'm not miserable and enjoy what I am learning. . . Economics is a HUGE field, and (sure, I'm biased) a very important one. We will always need economists. Aside from finding a job I just think its really great to be able to understand how the economy works, especially now since its tanking. I really recommend you at least try another Econ course and see how you like it.. . Also, I know it seems like you are competing with all of the Ross students, but remember when you graduate you aren't gonna be surrounded by them anymore, I have faith that plenty of companies will hire UMich Econ majors just based off of how much they already work with the various Economic societies at UMich. Not to mention, that I would argue that trying to find a job in CS at UMich is going to be even more competitive than econ/ross majors given the number of CS/EE majors here and the schools reputation. At the end of the day, yes, you are going to have to compete with your peers to get hired no matter what major you choose. That's life baby. . . SO, what I would say is: it is most important you find something you enjoy, be honest with yourself, you aren't gonna be happy at age 40 if you hate what you do no matter how much money you make. I switched my major like 5 more times before landing on Econ for sure, so you have PLENTY OF TIME before worrying about declaring anything at all. I didn't even finish all the pre-reqs needed to declare Econ until this semester, so I couldn't have done it earlier if I wanted. Take your time !. . . .

In the meantime, I gathered evidence and wrote up a nice pdf of a logical explanation with my evidence fhat I didn't cheat.

I go have my meeting with the person and lay all the facts on the table.

Ngl, I was super nervous for the meeting bc it's my first HC case, but it was very chill. The meetinng was like, no longer than 10 minutes. He says to expect an email within 2-3 weeks time and that if I didn't receive an email following up with further steps (ex. another meeting), it's probably good news. . . I waited like 4 weeks and didn't get an email or any other information, so I emailed him back and he says to just wait a little more. I think I waited appx 1-2 more weeks. Then, I got the official email from the associate dean of undergrad education (CoE) basically telling me my case was dismissed because the Honor Council didn't feel like there was enough evidence to prove that I cheated.

The only difference is it's more cloudy here, but anyone who makes a big deal about the cold or the snow is overdoing it because it's literally the exact same in the northeast.. . As for the atmosphere here, I know lots of people who don't care about the sporting events and do their own thing. While it is a big part of the overall culture, you will not be missing out on your college experience by not attending sports and frat parties. Everyone can enjoy what they enjoy here.. . For alumni, most people leave, mostly to Chicago, NYC, and the Bay Area. Not many people stay in Ann Arbor or Detroit.

I want to be in the big city! Wait... NEW YORK UNIVERSITY? Perfect!"" And then they go and realize it really is not all it's cracked up to be (source: friends and many anecdotes from various students). You will not get campus life at NYU, and IMO NYU is wildly overpriced even in the context of higher education already being overpriced (I know you said cost isn't really an issue, but had to bring it up). If NYU was the best school you got into, then of course you should go if cost isn't an issue, but I mean you got in here, this is a no brainer. I'd say the same if you got into any other top-tier school (Berkeley, Northwestern, Ivies, etc) so it's not just bias talking.. . I guarantee that if you come here you will not regret your decision. Ann Arbor is an amazing city and the university is the only beast in town. At NYU, it'll be easy to get lost in the hustle and bustle, and the school is generally very overhyped for the experience you actually get.. .

I can agree that my example is pretty egregious, but it stands to reason that cheaters affect the curve and/or diminish the value of getting an A. . . \> I'm pretty sure people who cheat aren't acing exams, and I'm pretty sure someone with a 2.7 wouldn't magically get a 4.0 if cheating was non existent. . . Also agreed, but maybe a smaller change, maybe from 2.7 to 3, can occur. I know of students who've been within 0.5 points of passing a course, but didn't. I'm not advocated that such a student necessarily ""deserved"" to pass, but I could make the argument that if a non-trivial percentage of students were cheating in this instance, and they were caught, the curve would have been (rightfully) adjusted and allowed this student to pass, and they wouldn't have had to retake the course. . . \> Maybe cheating has increased since we went online, but at some point, courses are gonna have to face reality, there's no efficient way to enforce an closed book, no internet exam in an online setting. At that point, cheating would be the better option for many students, and probably the majority option for students. . . I agree with this sentiment, and feel that non-open-note exams, when administered online, only serve to benefit cheaters. I'd like to hope that if faced with a non-open-note exam this semester, most students would not cheat, but as you mentioned there would be no way to verify that. . . I do feel that open note exams do have their place, but at times they are not particularly evaluative. I am a (recent) math department graduate, and can say that online, open note exams in the math department, at the <300 level, would be completely useless. Computing things by hand and knowing (either through derivation or memorization) formulas well enough to recall them without use of excessive/unlimited notes is pretty much the point of the courses at the lower undergrad level, and giving everyone notes/formula sheets defeated the purpose of the exam.

If you balance your schedule out with only one or two STEM courses per semester, and if you're driven by a genuine interest in the field of CS, then you'll most likely do fine.

t1_fq1m0ut,2020-05-09 17:53:58,t3_ggfsmo,t3_ggfsmo,"Nah not really. It's about integrity and making smart choices. There are SO many resources available now, and so much focus on making more and more and more available. Pretty much every programming class has at least 30 hours of office hours a week, frequently more (especially with the move to virtual, a class I taught offered 72 hours of office hours a week after the switch). There's videos galore, and for nearly all these classes, it's totally ok to talk concepts and project planning with your friends in the class. If you go to office hours early and start early, you'll have no issue. . . The honor code disproportionately penalizes people who procrastinate and aren't willing to put in the additional work that comes with that. And honestly? I'm fine with that. And I've been personally burned by it! I've suffered a lower grade on a project than what I would have earned by starting early and addressing my problems sooner. But ya know what? That's on me. Could I have cheated to fix it? Almost certainly. Did I? No. It's my fault for putting myself in that situation, and I'd rather take an L on the grade than be dishonest. If you procrastinate, you have to accept that resources (such as office hours availability and autograder submits) will be less available to you by virtue of procrastinating. If you're not prepared to complete this project with that disadvantage, that's on you. . . If you had a legitimate reason for starting late or not having time to work, lots of EECS classes are relatively lenient with extensions. If you got sick, or had a family emergency, they'll give you a very reasonable length extension. It can be hard to swallow your pride and ask for one (at least it was for me) but they're there if you need them. When I had a semester where I had a lot of medical issues, the course staff were very supportive and understanding and I got several extensions when necessary. Even when I only spent one day (like twelve hours) in the emergency room, I still got like a three day extension that was supportive of the fact that the exact time you miss for something major isn't necessarily equal to the time you lost on the work. . . A lot of people complain about how the honor code is unrealistic in the real world because of how much code copying happens. I've been working as a software developer (both in the summers and part time during the year) for about four years now. And when people say that, they're wrong. The instances where you find code online that solves your problem is vastly more common for courses that most people take vs having an actual real world problem. Sure sometimes you find ""starter code"" in the documentation for the tool you're using, but it's mostly vague stack overflow answers to someone's similar but also very different question. I legitimately believe the honor code prepares you for a world where 99% of the time, the work you want will not be sitting online or on a friends computer.

The major itself is not super difficult if you are motivated to get started on papers ahead of due dates. Classes are generally small (other than 101/102) and even if they are larger you're going to have smaller discussion sections (20-30 people) as well. Some classes are that size as well, those, I've found, are somewhat similar in feel to larger classes (note-taking wise and assignments) but are more personal. Workload isn't bad. You'll know within a month, at max, how seriously you need to take readings. I've been in classes where readings are irrelevant, so hold off on buying textbooks for a week or two as well in my opinion!. . I've always been into journalism too and while there's a few classes slanted that way, most of it is pretty scholarly focused. I'll echo thoughts left by others in saying that The Daily is a good place to start if you're interested!. . I think for the comm major especially experience in work or extracurriculars is probably more important than most just given the nature of the degree. Because the major itself has no real clear cut focus, it can kinda be whatever you want it to be. With that said, it means it's up to you to define that! It's not as scary as it sounds, I promise!

t1_fqbr706,2020-05-12 00:12:25,t1_fq8rvz5,t3_gh3b8m,"> and get full tuition waivers, so nobody pays for their tuition.. . Actually, you're right that they get waivers, but you're wrong about how it works. . . The basic system is that all students are assessed tuition, and someone (a person, a unit, a fund) has to pay for it if it is waived.. . If you are a tendered athlete, the athletic department pays your tuition. If you have an endowed scholarship, that fund pays your tuition. If you have a financial aid award, the financial aid budget pays your tuition. If you are a GSI, your hiring department pays your tuition. . . It's common to think that tuition waivers are like ""go to school free"" coupons and the University just ""forgives"" tuition for students with those kinds of waivers and scholarships. But it can't work that way because of the way tuition is attributed. . . You don't really see this as a student, because if you pay tuition you write one check to the University. But in fact, U-M has a budget system where academic units get some of the tuition from every student they teach. So if you're an LSA student and you take a course in social work, social work gets some of your tuition money. And this kind of thing happens a lot because UM values interdisciplinary learning. The only way this tuition waiver thing will work is if every dollar is accounted for, not just ""forgiven"" with no one keeping track. . . Imagine Joan is a grad student in Economics who is taking most of her classes in LSA but also a sustainability course over in SEAS and another cognate in SSW. And, Joan is a GSI in a Ross class. That means some of Joan's tuition flows to LSA, some goes to SEAS, and some goes to SSW. It's not really fair if it works like you describe. . If LSA waived Joan's tuition and ""nobody"" pays, that means LSA and SEAS and SSW each get nothing--and LSA may be fine with that, since Joan is their student, but SEAS and SSW don't have any say in that. Further more, LSA doesn't even get to enjoy Joan's labor in return for their waiver, since Joan is working over in Ross. . . So instead, Ross (the hiring unit) has to ""Pay"" the university for Joan's tuition bill, and that money will then be distributed among the units according to where Joan takes classes.. . ALL THIS TO SAY that this makes GSIs very expensive. If you hire Joan, you pay her stipend, you pay her insurance, and you pay for her tuition. A lot of units just build them into their budget and, when they hire their own grad students, it's just part of how they support their studies. But since not all GSIs are hired by their schools, and not all students stick to their own schools when taking courses, we gotta account for it.",7.0,error,0.0

(m) ""Physically helpless"" means that a person is unconscious, asleep, or for any other reason is physically unable to communicate unwillingness to an act.. . I agree it's weird that they explicitly exclude people who are incapacitated by drinking voluntarily from the definition of mentally incapacitated, but it seems to me that they would still fall under the definition of physically helpless. At first I thought that the difference here was meant for charging different degrees (ie an assaulter drugging someone against their will is considered worse than assaulting someone who drugged themselves, though both are still illegal) however, ""physically helpless"" seems to show up right next to ""mentally incapacitated"" every place it's mentioned, so I'm not sure what point of this is. . . I'm not a lawyer and this is completely my speculation, but it might have something to do with where the line for ""incapacitated"" is drawn. ""incapable of appraising or controlling his or her conduct"" sounds pretty vague to me, perhaps they mean for this to be less stringent than other states. The other statutes I've read generally use ""incapacitated"" to mean practically unconscious, then add another bit about how you can't have sex with someone if you've given them alcohol without their consent, even if they aren't incapacitated yet.

I feel like the competition there is so intense and stressful for getting an interview and even during your career! :/. . At least at my company we care more about your skills and knowledge rather than shiny internships on a resume. Take this current experience and use it to explain what you /don't/ want. Side projects show your passion for the subject and willingness to learn. They also differentiate yourself from others since everyone takes the same classes. Practice interviewing with your friends.

On the other hand if hybrid education entails life in the university will countinue on as usual (barring some newly implemented social distancing measures) and coming to the university you will acknowledge the risks associated with it (maybe make us sign a document or something) on the other hand if you cannot take those risks for whatever reason (immunocompromised, international travel still banned and cannot return to US...) you can take your classes online (lectures recordes, an online discussion section, online lab alternative...) , then I think we can reach the most socially beneficial outcome in terms of maximizing student happiness (they are not stuck with online classes and come back to AA in a meaningful way, better learning...) while minimizing number of student who take a gap year. The only issue I see is making sure students who take the classes online don't have an advantage when it comes to exams and I think that can be ensured by either online proctoring (you have a webcam open so a proctor can see you) or having separate curve for online students so they can have an open book open note exam without penalizing in person exam takers.

t1_fqja5j6,2020-05-13 21:58:45,t1_fqi17do,t3_gj1lb2,"OK, lets break this thought process down:. . Before we start, we can all agree that despite the high infectivity and a long incubation period, COVID-19 is not a plague of biblical proportions. It is not like Black Death where your chances of survival are minimal once you get it. Let's say the upper bound of the true mortality rate across all age groups is 5% while the conditional mortality rate for healthy college students is as of now (from what we know) much smaller. . . Now lets think about the consequences of a prolonged, multi year quarantine:. . 1) Increasing income inequality and the destruction of the middle class. It is unequivocal that quarantine decreases aggregate demand and places pressure on companies to cut costs. In such occasion, the middle tier employees are in greatest risk as you need blue collar workers for production, and you cannot simply lay off upper management without expansive compensation packages but middle tier employees with a decent wage and less overall impact in such times of economic downturn are prime candidate for cost cutting. This includes jobs university grads apply such as entry level and junior analyst positions as well as internships students need to get these jobs in the future. Before you reply the middle class cannot survive on stimulus checks and cannot seek employment in ""essential jobs"" for the time being as their cash flow would turn negative. Not all jobs can be done remotely and companies would layoff employees and freeze hiring in order to survive a prolonged decrease in aggregate demand. US already has enough income inequality, do you want more in the coming decades?. . 2) Governments would go broke. Simple. Less economic activity less tax base. Less predicted economic growth means harder time selling bonds and possible interest rate death spiral. US cannot simply give out stimulus for such a period as doing so may mean going broke.. . 3) Killing of small businesses and rise of oligopolies. Small businesses, especially in dining and entertainment, cannot survive as they already have razor thin margins, they get bough off and consolidation occurs. Think of airline carriers in the past.... . 4) People will stop listening and quarantine will stop being effective. Just read up on what is happening in London with the parks as it starts to get warmer.. . 5) Shortages. Due to decrease in labor force due to quarantine, production of certain goods will get shut down, disrupting supply chains. US has already started to experience meat shortages due to COVID-19 related disruptions to the meat packing industry. Just imagine a similar process occurs in dairy, fruits/vegetables... It is not just food, but also consumer goods which will be in short supply. How will you work from home if your computer breaks down and there aren't many computers being sold around? . . In the end, a prolonged quarantine will not only stop being effective, but also decrease our quality of life long term by increasing income inequality, killing of some competitive markets, and bankrupting governments. We will start experiencing shortages and this will cause even more widespread sentiment. Technological process and advancements quality of life will grind to halt thus our long term welfare will take a hit. A strict quarantine is not the solution, what we need is the so-called ""smart distancing"" where once adequate testing and PPE production can be established, we will continue life as usual while maintaining some social distancing measures (masks in public, frequent hand washing...) while quarantining only those at risk (65+, immuno-compromised...) until a vaccine can be developed. . . TLDR; A multiyear quarantine until a safe vaccine can be developed is analogous to prematurely cutting of a limb because of a broken bone or an infection. Sometimes it is necessary but if you put your head to it there are better alternatives that do not result in such a hit to long term quality of life.",10.0,error,0.0

Currently you will only be logged out if you disconnect from the session for more than ten minutes or your session length goes over 24 hours. You don't need a mouse mover; just adjust the sleep/hibernate settings on the computer you are connecting from to keep the system awake. If your computer goes to sleep and the network adapter is switched off you will be disconnected, and if you don't reconnect in ten minutes the VM you were connected to will be wiped and returned to the pool available to new users. . . Unless the service is at max capacity, which almost never happens, CAEN is not trying to bust people for running unattended simulations. If we didn't log off disconnected sessions the service would fill up with VMs abandoned by users with no intention of returning within hours. Unfortunately people never actually log out of Windows... they just close the browser or VMware app when they are done. Pro tip: use the Duderstadt Center or 32 GB of RAM pools instead of CAEN Labs 2019. They have less usage, so we are less strict about them, and those are the actual physical computers locked in the closed buildings instead of VMs so the performance will not be affected by server load. . .

I highly recommend using the ""Passcode"" option and choosing the ""text me new codes"" option when first authenticating Duo for this new number. That way, multiple passcodes (of which last for 30 days, and the first one you pick would be the one reused over and over again until expired) can be texted to the Google Voice number (and/or sent as a mail to the Gmail), since the ""Call"" and ""Press 1"" option doesn't always work.. .

Students who wish to audit a class need to talk to the course instructor about how much involvement they want from the professor and IAs. If they want exams and homework assignments graded, then that takes more investment from them, then they will likely get their request denied. Some courses also reuse the the same homework & exam materials semester-after-semester, which also may cause a denial. For a class such as EECS280, this isn't a big deal since they create new materials and place very little restriction on their gdrive access, even in this current iteration. If OP's only asking for autograder access, then it shouldn't be much of a problem. I've gotten formal audits approved in the past just fine, as long as you know how to get it without asking too much.

In 297 I think the grade floor was basically an A (handful of A-'s when I took it in its first semester but roughly 50/50 A/A+, don't know if it's changed since then). In 395 it seemed quite hard to get below a B+. Didn't stick around for 396 but same professor so I imagined it would be the same.. . The experience in 395/396 will vary heavily based on professor. Speyer's 39x is quite different from Barrett's.. . I also want to add that I think the opinion that 217 is slightly easier than 203 is heavily in the minority, and it's possible you were just comparatively weak in combinatorics than say the type of thinking used for linear algebra. Almost everyone I know including myself who's taken both think 217 is harder by a large margin. That said, I took 203 in the days before ""natural deduction"" or whatever that horrendous box proof stuff is, and I've heard that's pretty annoying material.. . @OP: If you are planning to do CS research then taking as much rigorous math as possible is a must.

Honestly, your concerns are so valid because of your identity when it comes to race, culture, and academic background.. . What I love about Michigan EECS specifically and the broader University is that they follow the philosophy of ""you can study what you want to study"", lowering barriers of entry for declaring and finish of major relative to schools like Cal and Illinois. . . However, this means that once you've begun studying, it is completely up to you to create your own support system and habits. Do not be afraid to ask for help when it comes to instructors and peers. What makes Michigan so great is that people are almost ALWAYS willing to help you because they learn more while teaching you, it's a win-win and a fundamental part of the Michigan Difference in my opinion.. . I will say that your geek culture generalization is generally pretty accurate, but hey that's what happens once you go through the EECS gauntlet up to 281. Courses not transferring is often a part of good schools like Michigan, which sucks.. . When it comes to age, it's really tough when you feel that disconnect. However, there are many other transfers in your spot. As a student in the BSI program, I've met a ton of classmates who've come from a very similar background as you. Seek these people out across colleges and join student orgs that have older students if that's what makes you feel more comfortable.. . In terms of making more friends bro, you don't always have to start with getting political and getting deep. Often times, this would create a sense of separation and scare people away in my experience. I find that taking the time to get to know someone and having a shared experience such as a team project or regular hangouts first really helps me if we decide to get deep/political. I would say not to rush this experience- keep in mind we are all trying to formulate our opinions of the world. Don't be afraid to take a step back, chill, and just have some fun before going and trying to strike a deep and meaningful conversation.. . Lastly, it can be so hard to find your place here.

So lost in fact, that if you aren't a genius, you start to hate what you are doing. I like to use euchre as an example, I know a lot of people will disagree and say p5 of 280 was worse, but the thing is, I actually enjoyed 05 and thought it was easier. Here's my reasoning. . . I started euchre a week early. But I didn't know how to play euchre. . . One of the reasons for my bad grade was failure to realize the end cases. This was a euchre problem, not a coding problem. . . Is it my fault for not having friends that play euchre? I wasn't comfortable with playing with others and reading and watching vids online was so confusing. . . Office hours? Forget about it. 1 week early and I wait hours for a bad IA to tell me there's nothing they can do even after I take time to OUTLINE MY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS and show my test cases, my reasoning, and my way of approaching the problem. Don't get me wrong, I know how bad IAs can get it, and most of them want what's best for the student. But there's a small minority that do it for the money, and I can reason with that, but like, my grade man. I waited hours and pulled all nighters that last week. I sat there in office hours and got myself in the queue a total of ten times over the week. THE LAST DAY a random student, NOT AN IA, teaches me how to use the command line so I don't have to compile every time and actually be able to step through it. Why has no IA recommended this to me after describing my problems? Why am I expected to know these things exist if I'm in an intro to programming course? I did terrible on p3, and it was a deciding factor for exiting CS. I got full points on p4, p5, and an 89 on the final! But nope, p3 and the state of the department left a bad taste in my mouth. Kinda pissed me off. I know it gets better, and people say 281 is great, but I've had it. . . 370 is another example. Some professors love to get the concept in your head, and to be fair, 370 projects are just to implement the understanding of concepts. I couldn't tell you how many times the project was basically done but syntax errors kept me from completion and everyone was honor code this and honor code that. The honor code was made for good intentions to catch cheaters, but this is the negative side effect. Professor Brehob was amazing though. My friend had an issue, and so the professor said if you can prove to me that your code does A and B, then I'll look into it. Friend proves, professor looks, and finds underlying issues that date back to the 1st project (projects in 370 build on one another at times), so he gets it fixed, and boom, gets the grade he deserves. . . It's not just CS man, I wish. Every department here at certain levels wants to murder you, and then you get the curves, and they're like, this prepares you for the workforce! *seriously?* I understand that we need to be pressured, but I'm not going to do anything with this. All that happened is that my GPA was destroyed and I can't apply to masters. I guess my friend who went to an easy college and got a higher gpa and got accepted to masters here is the really smart one huh?. . My friends took 183 and when they reflect back, learning python and c++ at the same time was the worst, they tell me. It's an INTRO CLASS, there's no time to mess up syntax when you are leaving basic building blocks, like what even is this. You don't even use python until 2 years later, and then you have to learn it on your own again. At least in eng 101 (183 equiv for engineers) you learn Matlab instead, and that's useful for other classes. The fact that you don't learn python makes me wonder, is this difference in curriculum that drastic? Can't they do away with python?. . If I was to summarize, CS professors are nice and caring, but the influx of students and strict anti cheating procedures increase workload and hinders creativity for honest people. I could have easily put my name on someone else's project and became partners and got full points, but hell no, I have my integrity, and what do I get for it? Nothing. . . . I hope this helps.

t1_fqx4hby,2020-05-17 14:26:38,t3_gjx9ib,t3_gjx9ib,"Doing well in high school does not directly translate to doing well in college. Maybe this is an indication that you need to step back and assess your strategy for completing assignments, taking tests, participating in class, etc. to determine why you are not meeting your goals. It is understandable that you will slip every once in a while in life and not meet expectations that you have set for yourself. The trick is properly adjusting to the adversity you face and coming out the other side a better person.. . The following is an example of what I am talking about: I scored lower than I had planned to score on the first Physics 240 exam one semester. At the time, it was the lowest score I had ever received relative to the class's curve. I was very disappointed with myself, and after a brief period of pouting and ""feeling sorry for myself"", I sat down and tried to figure out what I could have done to score better on the test. I eventually realized that even if the test taker understood the material well, in order to achieve a high score they needed to be able to rapidly recall the required information and precisely perform calculations. I had not been able to do either of those tasks when taking the test. Therefore, leading up to the next test, I designed a practice routine that I would work through every day. I used a large bank of test problems and tried to answer the questions as quickly as I could to practice in a simulated test scenario. I would give myself less time that than I would have during the test to do a similar number of problems. I reminded myself what some famous athlete had once said (paraphrasing), ""Practice should be so hard that games are easy."" With this new strategy, I scored up to my expectations on all of the remaining tests.. . So to apply this to your situation, you first need to ask yourself a few questions and determine what the honest answer to those questions are. Are you having difficulty understanding the material taught in the class (affecting all assignments)? Do you understand the material, but perform poorly on routine assignments? Are you struggling with group work in the classes (i.e. you would have performed well on a congruent single person assignment, but didn't perform well in the group version)? Are you doing well on routine assignments/projects but not performing well on tests?. . Once you have identified what areas of the class you are struggling in, divert resources to try to fix that problem. If there are multiple problems, try to generate a strategy that is capable of jointly solving multiple problems. There are many routes that you can take from this point and that depends on your specific situation. However, don't just give up. If you have the attitude that ""there is nothing I can do"" and just give up, you are basically just writing yourself off as being unable to accomplish goals you have set for yourself. You may be in a situation where you can only achieve B's, and as some of the other comments have covered that is not particularly a bad thing at a school such as U of M. But should always strive to do better, and that is what I'm hoping that you will try to do.",2.0,error,0.0

This makes me really feel like my race (Hispanic) is a huge part of what got me in.. . Essays matter a lot less than people like to imagine they do. They may make a difference for a marginal applicant, one where they are on the fence. Then great essays can either convince the committee you're even better than the rest of the application suggests, or at least make them feel like taking a chance on you is valid. Doesn't sound like that was the case with you. So don't think a non-spectacular score on your essay means you were ready for rejection. There are lots of non-spectacular essay writers admitted to this campus.. . Also, thanks to the affirmative action ban, it wasn't your race that got you in. It is true that UM examines applications closely for other kinds of under-representation, so it's possible that coming from a non-affluent neighborhood or taking a non-traditional path to college was a factor that helped you. Maybe it's thin comfort to think ""it's not my skin but it was my address"" but it's more than that, it's UM considering that your academic success came under conditions that may have made it harder for you to succeed. . . Transfer admissions can be a little less selective than freshman admissions. That doesn't mean they make more mistakes or take worse people; it means there are fewer applicants per opening, generally, and more to the point, the folks who evaluate your application have more confidence when they've seen you've coped with college-level work before. Yes, maybe your previous courses at a community college got you easy A's. But there are kids who *don't* get A's in those classes. Maybe the reason they were so easy for you isn't just because they were so simple and unrigorous, but because you have a head for the subject and also you had your head out of your ass enough to turn in assignments and show up to class. U-M may be tougher, but that doesn't mean you and your academic interests and your intellect and work ethic don't belong here.. . It totally sucks to feel isolated and I'm sorry about that. . . People grow and change during college, emotionally and intellectually. Since you are a little older, you've done a lot of that already. So the disconnect you feel with other students when talking about topics isn't necessarily surprising. You're just ahead of where some of them are emotionally and intellectually. I'm not saying this to run them down, it's human development. I know that's not necessarily comforting but understand that it's not because you don't belong. You're outnumbered, but you deserve to be here.. . I see you've had some suggestions for resources. Another place you could reach out to is CEW+. They work with nontraditional students. When they were founded, they were more oriented towards women who were going back to college while juggling family responsibilities but they do more than that now.

I know everyone thinks of the University as a heartless tuition-eating monster, but the truth is faculty and staff are real people and nobody looks forward to a heartbreaking ""maybe you should try something else"" conversation with a student who missed the cues that something was wrong and has burned three or four years of tuition as a result.. . EDIT: In the interest of sparking discussion: I think the biggest problem is the lack of incentive structure to hire full time *teachers*. Tenure-track faculty are neither required to do much teaching nor put much effort into it. (A few do, but they do it out of a sense of conscientiousness and personal responsibility, not because anyone is telling them to.) The best instructors tend to be the non-tenure track faculty (lecturers). But to be a full-time lecturer in EECS means taking a big pay cut compared to the private sector. So we have the same story every year: we didn't hire many lecturers because hardly anyone applied.. . Personally I'm finishing (knock on wood) a PhD in CSE and would love to work as a full-time lecturer. I've taught lectures of 100 students as a grad student already and enjoyed it. But I'm not going after those jobs because at places like Michigan they're nearly all one-year contracts for roughly $60-70k/year. I'm not some ML genius who's got job offers dangling everywhere, but like, that's less than a friend of mine who teaches *middle school* makes (and they have great job security!)",35.0,negative,0.5904815196990967

If you are curious as to why the Econ department has this policy it is because they have data showing that there is a correlation between taking econ 101 prior to taking 401 and doing better in 401; However, this relationship is not causal since the students who take 401 after 101 are older, have more experience at the university etc. They have used this correlation to justify the claim that material taught in 101 is a foundation for the material taught in 401. In actuality, you don't need 101 to suceed in 401. . . The following are true about AP micro, 101, and 401. . A) 101 and AP micro teach the same thing. . B) There are no concepts taught in 101 but not in AP micro that you need to suceed in 401. . To support these claims, all I can provide is my own experience.

I certainly like CS, and EECS 203 was probably my favorite course I have taken here, but if I could study anything I want, it would probably be a mix of polisci and history. The reason I study CS is because I do like it to some extent, and it leaves open every possible door open for me to do whatever I want. I am not sure if I want to be a normal software engineer or data analyst/data scientist, so I am interested in looking at law school or working for campaigns or even doing a polisci PhD (that was what I came in wanting to do). CS leaves all of these paths open. Law school even likes STEM students because STEM programs are especially rigorous and develop important critical thinking skills. If I want to work for campaigns, I can end up at a place doing data work for them. If I want to pursue a PhD, a background in CS will put me way ahead of my peers in terms of the quantitative methods used in most social science research. And even if I decide I don't want to do any of those things, I am able to fit in a Middle Eastern and North African studies major, so I can always try to work for an NGO or something that requires more soft skills. If I leave college not knowing what I want, I will be able to work a CS job for a few years and make enough money to discover what I really want to do. I do enjoy CS, but it isn't my true passion.

When I was 11, I had a ""genius"" idea for a platformer video game, called ""Stickman"". It was, in fact, a stickman conquering various hand-drawn enemies to reach a goal. I'd planned out a bunch of levels in a notebook (I might still have it somewhere) and figured that, since I'd gotten the hard part done, all I had to do was learn how to program so I could make it a full video game. Couldn't take longer than a month.. . For my 12th birthday, I got a Python programming book. I took one excited skim through the book and realized, ""Ah. This'll take more than a month."" But, uncharacteristically, I didn't give up on the project after a week. Instead, I told myself to take it slow and learn programming naturally. So I did, and have been, for almost 7 years now. It's the only hobby I've really been able to stay committed to for a long period of time. I still haven't created Stickman, partially out of the irrational idea that doing so would end my programming adventure. But I have created many dozens of neat working programs, from fractal generators to a scantron-reading and data-storing app for my FRC team. And I really came to love it.. . Then I found out how strong the market for this is, and I decided that would be my passion and career choice. I've stuck CS to my identity, and no matter what path I follow now, I'm sure I'll find some way to attach programming and data science to it.. . Now... EECS 281 was not a good example of this. This course was where I learned my weaknesses in programming (I am too used to Python, and am a bit too focused on flexibility over speed). I almost failed the class, and if it weren't for covid, my GPA would have plummeted. Some of these courses aren't easy, or even fun. So I'm taking advice from some grad friends; I'll be taking the easy route to the degree, and following passion projects and internships along the way.. . Anyway, I just felt like spilling all of this into a reddit comment.. . TLDR: Some, like me, really enjoy programming and CS, just because. Some are just here for the market. But Umich's first few classes don't seem to be great at instilling passion in students new to the field.

It's a really fascinating class (easily one of my favorites) but it also very heavily builds on its prerequisites. Because the project is so central to the course and it is taught as an MDE, the project starts pretty early, which means you'll need to be fluent enough with the 373 material to start making high-level decisions about the design of your project from the very beginning (though lectures will start to help things like PCB design which won't need to be ready until midterm). I will say though that if you can make a link between your primary field and your project, it could make for a very interesting project!. . I think /u/Vessec has a good summary of the key takeaways from 373. I'm not sure what your advisor had in mind, but I would say the most important thing is being able to work with a microcontroller without using the Arduino IDE. That could be a dev board like the [Nucleo F401RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html) used for the COVID-adjusted 373 projects last semester, or if you already had an Arduino you could program it [with another IDE and library set](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/april/article4.php) to get around the parts where Arduino holds your hand a bit too much. Memory-mapped I/O and using the microcontroller's internal registers are another important skill from 373 that demonstrate a good understanding of how things work in the microcontroller (even if they're often abstracted away by libraries of some kind). Also, if your main field is not ECE, you'll probably want to brush up on some EECS 215 circuit material as well. You can skate by without going into too much detail for many things, but it's good to know. . . I wouldn't worry too much about FPGAs/Verilog if your goal is 473 - most groups don't use them. They have many applications, but in 373 I think they're more important as a teaching tool for things like MMIO and timers. The same goes for assembly, even though the first few labs in 373 use it.

You're encouraged to use them for prototyping (and they're required for the labs) but for the project deliverables most groups design and solder a PCB with a microcontroller and all the other necessary bits on it rather than using an out-of-the-box development board like Arduino (the project intro slides call this [""almost required""](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs473/Lec/473L02F19.pdf)). Arduino's IDE also doesn't have the best tools for debugging. I'm not sure if it's explicitly prohibited but you'll definitely be pushed in that direction. I suppose technically you might be allowed to put an ATMega328 on a circuit board and use it like an Arduino (that's the standard Arduino Uno microprocessor) but that's a matter of your use case and everything else.

If US keeps its borders closed/restricted, it will probably be to tourist visas, not student visas. So international students should realistically be able to enter as education is ""essential travel"" not leisure.. 2. Unlike other countries, US is unlikely to impose a government controlled quarantine (i.e. a situation where you enter quarantine at government facility for 14 days) due to size and monetary issues; however, probably expect a 14-day self-quarantine upon entry so don't buy a ticket to arrive 2-3 days before classes start.. 3.

Not all airlines are still operating flights to and from US so the main issue will be finding a flight from your home country to the US. The most realistic option may be a plethora of connecting flights (example: first fly to Europe, then fly to DTW or Chicago/NY/Atlanta... then to DTW...).. 4. Expect the unexpected. With new COVID regulations, airlines can deny you travel if you exhibit COVID-like symptoms and/or have a fever. Flights can get cancelled last-second and borders can close again.. . . . TLDR: Expect the unexpected. There is still time for things to change but I'd suggest if you have a place to stay (friends, early lease, family...) in the US, arrive as soon as you can if the classes are in-person and you want to attend them in person. A recent posts on Instagram by the official U of M account said something about adapting the dorms to new social distancing measures, which indicates towards at least an in-person/hybrid semester in fall so once an exact announcement is made by the university, plan your travels and plan them earlier than normal (like mid-August rather than late August...)",20.0,neutral,0.8543484210968018

Now, it's a gigantic document, and you can/will/should not try to read and memorize it all.

I won't try to explain it all, as I've had much more experience with ARM microcontrollers than AVR, and I don't want to mislead, but the general gist is that you can write to one memory location to control whether it's an input or output pin, you write to another memory location to write it high or low (if output), and you read from another memory location to read whether it's high or low output. . . [Here's an article](https://balau82.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/programming-arduino-uno-in-pure-c/) outlining a little bit of the process for Arduino.

MSU is still a good school, but I really hope you strongly consider what you want to study before applying to anything.. . You are in a great spot going from comm to UX. UX blends in topics of visual design (think illustrator/logo/art), psychology (cognitive/social), and communication (when you actually conducting user research in the form of interviewing users, analyzing+aggregating+synthesizing the data you collect). . . End of the day, UX people at real companies can handle a wide variety of actual needs. This can be good or bad for you depending on what you want to do. For example, you might be designing only, doing design and research, designing and coding, etc. The job requirements vary greatly.. . As for the program itself: 2 years of the BSI will grant you more or less the same knowledge of an MSI student. However, MSI classes are definitely better because you're surrounded by people with much more experience and grad students are frankly much more interested and put a lot more preparation to get a UX role in the workforce. . . . As a student studying UX, you have to be hauling ass outside of school. The classes in the School of Information are good and EASY, but they only give you the bare foundations required to start learning. You should be working on side projects, learning about design from online communities, and carving your professional path as soon as you start the program. Solely coasting through the classes will get you nowhere. (Median grade for every SI class is either A- or A), pretty inflated so you can recruit better.. . If you have the money and time and you're really happy at state, I would stay at state and then apply for the MSI. However, if you're unhappy and do want to transfer, you can complete the BSI and then go for the accelerated 1 year MSI program instead of 2 years which is new this year (Fall 2020).

It doesn't matter how many classes you take if in the end you don't have any experience designing products / don't have projects & design rationale you could talk about in interviews. It's definitely possible to get a well paying UX design job from the BSI education alone, you just have to haul ass outside of class working on personal projects in order to make it happen. . . Wanted to supplement this comment -- most of the people I've talked to (MSI grad students, potential employers, alumni) don't recommend doing the MSI masters program if you have the opportunity to do the BSI -- it's true that the students in the MSI are probably more experienced, but the base curriculum is essentially the same between the BSI and MSI (literally the same instructor will teach a undergrad and grad version of the same course), and again having a good portfolio is one of the most important parts of getting a UX job. . .

Your scores are therefore high enough to meet the LSA foreign-language requirement. If you wish to continue taking courses in Spanish, your placement is Spanish 277. Spanish 277 (Reading, Grammar and Composition) provides additional practice in oral and written communication, as well as an introduction to literature in Spanish. It is intended to increase the accuracy of students' Spanish, and to expand their cultural and literary knowledge through readings.. . So I think some people have to do the spoken thing? But the thing is, when I was waiting to take my spoken test, there was a girl there who was from venezuela and spoke fluent spanish who also got flagged for the in person thing. I can only assume she got a near perfect score on the online exam before orientation, so maybe they pull people randomly? not sure of their process.. .

I think the best course of action is to treat us like the adults we are and make us sign documents that allows the university take actions against organizations or individuals who willingly endanger students by not abiding by the new set of rules tht are placed to prevent spread. If a frat/ club affiliated with U of M throws a party that doesn't abide by social distancing, they get suspended for time being maybe fined. Covid is hear to stay and instead of finding comfort in extreme solutions (full on lock-downs, having school online, sending students home because a handful cannot social distance...) until a medicinal treatment/ vaccine is found (which is for sure at least a year out, you cannot fast track a vaccine, these things usually take years to develop) we have to learn to live with it. Unlike Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard etc, U of M is a large university whose income heavily relies on tuition as opposed to a hefty endowment thus we cannot risk the decrease in enrollment due to Covid hysteria. I already have friends who are taking gap year or semester because they don't want to burden their family for what is essentially lecture recordings (that you can also find online) in a time where disposable income is not easy to cone by.",3.0,negative,0.6410178542137146

Also the investments made with the endowment is likely underperforming right now due to the economic side effects of Covid. The university can survive reduced enrollment but it will not be all sunshine and flowers for the students for that time being as TA's will be in short supply as departments reduce admitted phd students while giving grad students less stipends and less research opportunities for undergrads as projects compete for funding in short supply. We already have a year long hiring freeze and some departments (I think philosophy or psychology) are closing phd applications for the following term in order to focus on current students. These are due to the sudden and unexpected price of having to pay for new online infrastructure ( the new zoom/ blue jeans subscriptions to cover online lectures, those things are not cheap considering the size of U of M) and expanding library e-catalogs (our history professor made a remarj about how the librarians are being told for the first time that money is not an issue and they should try to get access to as many sources as possible so students/ researchers can continue on with their research while libraries are closed) in a moments notice.

Sure it's almost six decades late but I am here to [strongly disagree with that take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdcJrFMGoAI). Here is a brief rundown of events from that ""dying"" weekend: sky divers, elephant races, parades, pep rallys, a bonfire, the Mudbowl, Chariot races on the diag, a ""yell like hell"" cheer contest, go-kart races, two dances, and stand-up at Hill Auditorium from Bob Newhart. The full schedule of events from [Homecoming 1962 can be seen here.](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754324/394). . Last week I [posted about the roller skating fad](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/gnv43p/throwback_thursday_roller_skating_in_front_of/) that hit college campuses in the late 1920s and early 30s. That was far too pedestrian for students in the 1960s, so they moved on to elephant races. In [May of 1962 at Orange County State College](http://calstate.fullerton.edu/news/inside/2007/elephantrace.html) (now Cal State Fullerton) the first ever intercollegiate elephant race was held. Participants from 9 schools around the country, [including Harvard](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1962/5/7/harvard-group-enters-elephant-in-big/), sponsored elephants in the race. . . On October 4th the homecoming committee announced plans for the [""First Big 10 Intra-Intercollegiate Elephant Race""](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754324/241). For $225 (about $1,900 in today's money) houses could sponsor an elephant in one of three planned races. Unlike the races in California, students would not actually be riding the elephants during the race but rather the elephants would race with students running alongside. From the photo it seems like the elephants were led by the trainers that brought them.. . On Friday, October 26th several thousand people (the [Ann Arbor News reported 4,000](https://aadl.org/aa_news_19621027-a_tail_of_races), the [Michigan Daily reported](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754324/405) 10,000) turned out to Ferry Field to see the elephant races. All of this mind you was taking place in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis.. . The event didn't exactly live up to the hype but it was still quite a spectacle. The elephants, which were being provided by a trainer in Indiana, were delayed in arriving. Due to cold weather the elephants were allowed to just participate in short 100 yard races. The next day the Daily declared, [""Pallid Pachyderms Too Pooped To Pace""](https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071754324/405). Because of the late start the intercollegiate race was cancelled due to darkness. No doubt there were some very disappointed students who had traveled to participate from the University of Washington, Adams State College (Colorado), the University of Illinois, and Orange County State College. . . The intracollegiate races were still held, groups were allowed to place decorated jackets over each of their elephants [(photo of that here)](https://aadl.org/sites/default/files/photos/N036_1131_006.jpg). Stew, the nickname given to the elephant sponsored by the Sigma Delta Tau kitchen staff, was the winner. . . As for the actual homecoming football game, it was one to forget.

Also need to keep in mind that eecs 370 is a 300 level course, which probably isn't something that anyone can teach (so there is a lack of good staff to hire to begin with) and should only have 200 people per semester, at most (b/c it is a 300 level course). Otherwise, need more staff to make up the difference. . . Another suggestion is to eliminate ap credits for cs and ce majors to maybe lower the number of 1st year and 2nd years taking a 300 level course (this may sound dumb, but just throwing out some ideas). Or just lowering the max number of ap credits that can be applied to a cs/ce major.. .

When I was planning for classes, the advisor from my department suggested to take 3 full classes (about 9 credits worth) and if I want to add more, I can add seminar-like classes (ie; PIBS503) or journal club. The thing about grad school is that, I tend to have less menial work to do, so things like quizzes, weekly report, pre-class quizzes, etc. But the materials and content of the class is more complex and I am expected to be able to understand these materials and form my own opinions about it or apply the knowledge into real life situation. So while I have lesser assignments to submit, the bulk of my time is spent understanding the concepts taught in class, see how other people in the field use it and give my own opinions about the application (ie; is this trustable? are the researchers missing something?) Also, I'm not sure if you will be doing research as well but that is another time commitment you need to consider.. . For example; I took PHYSIOL 520 some time ago. It was a class on modeling for physiological systems. In terms of workload, I only had to submit 2 projects for the entire semester. But a lot of the time is spent understanding the physiological systems, old computational models, how those old models have fared with modern discoveries and what current work is being done using an updated model, etc.. .
