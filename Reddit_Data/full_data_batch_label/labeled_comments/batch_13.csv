t1_g4ryqmb,2020-09-11 00:56:06,t1_g4rwxrc,t3_iqdb1f,"So reading the AMA I can briefly say my thoughts on this. GEO has said that the best way to handle covid is with mass testing, and ACTUAL contact tracing (I have numerous stories of people who were in contact with positive patients who can't get tested because they have no symptoms. So that's not effective). I fully agree and support this. Testing, and more testing is the best way to handle this, and would require almost no ""policing"" of any kind.. . The other point that GEO makes that I also agree with, is that fundamentally the majority of crime happens because people do not have things they need. Wether that is stable housing, food, income, ect. The best way to actually curb crime rates is by getting people access to many of these basic needs. Policing typically exacerbates these issues. A police record makes it harder to get a job, it can demoralize and dehumanize people where they don't feel apart of the Community. If people are over policed and disrespected they most likely will have less respect for the Community. By reducing funding to police and increasing funding to social programs, we can support people and give them avenues to success rather than giving them fines, or other punitive measures. This is the core of defunding police. . . In regards to defunding DPSS I have personally seen many DPSS officers fail to enforce health policies in any meaningful way, so clearly they are not effective in this instance. They don't need weapons, as the data shows there had been one discharge in years, and it was for a deer. So why do they feel the need to carry weapons. It would be more effective to use the DPSS funding for things like more testing, having nurses at the dorms to take temperatures and help enforce guest policies, ect. Essentially my point earlier, DPSS is not trained for this, and even with training would make students uncomfortable. . . In terms of cutting ties with AAPD I don't know the details but I have seen headlines and other spurts of information pointing to racial discrimination issues and harm done to the black community in particular with no repercussions to said officers. Because of this many students feel unsafe and anxious with the presence of AAPD and it is yet another mental burden that many of us can't feel and may never experience. We have to recognize that just because we don't experience this mental strain, doesn't mean it isn't real.

In the original articles about this the ruling was in favor of the officer using self defense. I don't really want to argue whether or not it was. The biggest argument against police right now in general is that people want de-escalation and non lethal action to be the best way for police to handle these situations. So again I won't argue any details. . . 2. This article references the AAPD started using body cams after this. With the numerous cases of police lying about incidents with Black folx in the US it is difficult for people to trust the details of this case. . . This is another article https://www.theannmag.com/did-aura-rosser-die-in-vain/. . Remember every article will have inherit bias I am not trying to say one or both of these are right.

That historically police as a function of society stems from racist activity dating back to slavery. Even if AAPD is a decent police unit, that does not take away the history of policing. The issues surrounding the killing of Aura Ross, still exacerbates this history even if it was out of self defense. Which again cannot actually be proven with footage (maybe not a known issue with AAPD but an issue with police across the nation). Distrust is real and valid, and having any of those emotions because of ties with AAPD is also valid. I may not feel those emotions, you may not feel these emotions, but students and GSI's very clearly do or they would not be fighting to cut ties with AAPD. Which I also cannot seem to see the clear benefit of having ties with in the first place. We have more than enough money to create social programs and community based outreach that could again fill the gap of AAPD. . .

They can provide suggestions (and did), but if they list a specific part in the DPSS and UoM has a reason that specified cut can't be done, the whole deal can get swept and GEO can't always go back and change it (at least as I understand it. Bargaining is hugely complicated, often planks - the platforms - will be worked for at least a year, sometimes longer if a previous bargaining failed and they had to go back to the drawing board. A single plank can be dozens of pages long, which is why actual bargaining can take months of multiple weekly meetings. Sometimes for the planks an employerdoes want, they can keep postponing it until the end of bargaining when time is short and use that pressure to avoid the union having time to change it).. . So while vague is less compelling, it is actually actionable. If its specific and any mistake was made, the whole thing goes boom. For this strike it becomes more complicated, but being specific still limits the ease of a reasonable counter offer. Otherwise a mistake or technicality can get it completely removed. Often in striking, a union will get the offer late in the day, with threats of ""it disappeares by midnight tonight"". So they are forced to vote on that offer, and can lose other concessions if they try to counter offer, because they were told the offer wouldn't be valid by they next day! So no movement happens at all on the demand, unless they risk the other concessions. . . For example if the demand was ""pull funds from the cute K9 dogs"" and the University would never allow pups to lose money, on offer they will say ""never!"", and there is no time for GEO to suggest an alternative like ""what about x instead?"". But the University knows where it would cut for sure, so with a blanket ""cut 50% statement"" they can come back and say ""ok, budgeted fir 4 new officers this year which is 15% of that budget, let's say no new officers this year"" then the GEO can vote on that asap.. . Does that mean GEO will get said counter offer? Idk. That's very much in flux with how much support the strike has and continues to gain and how much money the University loses during it (thus why they picket construction sites. Other union works try never go cross picket lines so if they go on strike they are afforded the same respect). I have my suspicions on what will happen but we will have to see",3.0,error,0.0

While well-intentioned at its core, in my experience (VP and then president of an on-campus club in 2013 and then 2014) the Inclusion Committee people were total whackjobs. Many members came from the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters's (our CASL, AA's LS&A) honors program. Now keep in mind that these were very intellectual people who came from many different walks of life.. . . . That said, the group was overwhelmed by what would now be called Social Justice Warriors in every extent of the internet caricature.. . . . An Inclusion Committee at UM-D isn't necessarily a bad idea. For example, a very large part of the student body is of Middle Eastern descent. Of that group, a large part identifies as Muslim. I would like to see efforts made to better integrate the large Middle Eastern student population (Muslim or otherwise) into the rest of the student population, as my experience over 5 years was that many of the Middle Eastern and Muslim students formed cliques and refused to interact with students of other races, creeds, and faiths. I imagine a large part of that is due to the large population of Dearborn-area graduates enrolling at UM-D for their undergrad. Why would one need to expand their horizons and make friends if you can keep a familiar friend group that you've had since freshman year?. . . . At the end of the day, I think this gaffe was actually a success, as it has people talking about racial biases in the direction of privileged to the unprivileged, but also in the reverse, which is very real and very problematic.

I find it interesting that GEO either refuses to release their evidence, or, perhaps, simply doesn't have any actual evidence beyond anecdotes, for key components of their demands. . . Specifically, they won't share evidence that DPSS is actually causing quantifiable harm to the UM community: ""We don't have that specific data ready, but we do have multiple stories of policing on campus causing negative mental and physical health impacts. We also have evidence that DPSS is used politically."". . Also, I'm not surprised GEO is getting no movement on the police demand from the University. GEO is essentially asking UM to serve as their own executioner: ""[GEO strike platform does not specify how cuts to police budgets should be implemented. We are willing to work with the university on the details if they make an offer.]"". . Further, related to reports of UM forcing GSIs to teach against their will in-person: . . ""How many GSIs are currently being asked to teach in person against their will?. Answer: We have been trying to gather that info for two months now, and face two barriers: 1) we do not have a full list of GSIs, and 2) many of the most likely targets for this coercion are the new or last-minute GSIs that we have no line of communication to. We can only defend people we know about, and finding them is difficult."". . Again, it seems premature to charge the University with a crime for which there is no hard evidence. Everything I've seen from UM's press releases suggest they have been working in good faith. It's not UM's fault that future GSIs chose to not fill out the survey instrument.. .

Much like influenza. There are at least four other coronaviruses that do so (see: [https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/jgv.0.001439](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/jgv.0.001439)).. . The goal has always been to limit hospital capacity. All I was saying above is that several months ago, and still today, many physicians and scientists, including some here at Michigan Medicine, are of the opinion that we have yet to demonstrate otherwise and that all of our efforts to stop the virus cold in its tracks will be for naught (e.g. due to mutation, etc.). Meanwhile, there are the very real ethical issues, including other medical morbidity and mortality, that are ever-present due to some of the Covid-19 mitigation strategies in place. Now that our understanding and capabilities related to treating Covid and limiting its spread are better understood, we can begin to take calculated risks such as reopening to balance the risk of morbidity and mortality from Covid versus the morbidity and mortality from social isolation, not being able to get other healthcare services, etc. As of this morning, if I recall correctly, we have about 10 Covid patients in University Hospital. We can handle WAY more...I would know 'cause I was there treating them.. . That said, your point that we may be able to stop Covid in its tracks is a possibility. Similar to how we have greatly limited HIV spread and even how Covid's close relative, SARS, is well-restrained by the Chinese every year. If this is the ultimate answer, then the costs of staying closed and limiting every possible infection become relatively much lower. Same is true, as I mention above, should a fully effective vaccine become available and readily deployed (big if, in my opinion, both from a biologic and social view).. . Personally, I wish UM would have remain closed. But that is what works best for me - plus, I'm currently on my second Covid-19 infection and am quarantined forever anyway. There are a lot of people suffering from a lack of other medical services, social interaction, economic stress, etc. who would disagree with me. And my previous comments were more to highlight that I think the University's decisions are far more nuanced than we realize.

There are a lot of people in the world who are in the habit of huffing about how they will ""never donate again"" or ""never patronize this place/service again"" when in fact they aren't donors, or aren't regulars, and their threat is pretty empty in terms of the organization facing financial circumstances. . I learned this when I was affiliated with a college that made a big change and upset a lot of alums. It was widely known that the loudest withholders of support were probably those who didn't typically support the school much anyway. The alumni & development office cared about everyone's anger, but they didn't give more attention to the people who threatened to stop giving. So yes, let them know of your donation plans but understand that just letting them know that as an alum you're concerned is important.

However two things I have either failed to make clear or you are jumping on incorrectly:. . >but you have to admit that you're personally working to fill in the gaps and vagaries in GEO's list of demands in a fashion that shouldn't have been necessary were GEO more competent.. . I am trying to explain history and rules of union bargaining I see are being misrepresented or that people are missing so coming to erroneousconclusions. Not fill in gaps in policy. Please, if you think I have defined any policy set forth by GEO that is NOT what I meant. I just noticed many people have little knowledge of how unions and employers work and trying to explain them in regard to why somethings are wonky. As we have moved along my statements have gone more from ""here is why this is vague"" to ""here is an example of a possible acceptable outcome"" to me being wiling to add in my personal opinion to better outline how id like it to go. But any policy you think I have fleshed out on, that was only in example form, not anything official.. . >You're also tacitly conceding that the as-stated GEO demands aren't reasonable. . No. Im not. I said I personally see my ideal outcomes as those stated above. My ideals =/= others nor do they equal what is reasonable or not. Ideally I think child care should be free for worksy parents. Is that reasonable? Ideally for me, the GEO should have gone for asking Uo M give officially a number of cases that they would shut down if reached. This was considered too unreasonable by my colleagues, and didnt end up on the platform. . . My ideal =/= is reasonable, please don't assume that. You see it as reasonable because YOU agree with it more than GEO'S platform. And others will look at it and say I'm unreasonable because it isn't MORE like GEO'S platform.",1.0,error,0.0

I have long wished that the University had better practices, policies and channels for communicating how it operates and why it makes the decisions it does. I attribute this to a couple of things: one is culture, which is hard to change and needs to come from a high level but also some other levels too. I would like to see a will to fix this culture, though.. . The other is cost. To really communicate well across (and beyond) such a large decentralized institution, you need to have people who are good at it and who can dedicate their professional time to doing it regularly and strategically. We need more of these people than we currently have. UM really tries to limit its administrative growth so it is a very hard sell to hire more people who, useful as they are, aren't going to increase student services or improve compliance. . . It's also challenging because when it comes to students, all the communication has to be repeated since they graduate and move on and new students come in. . . I absolutely think it is worth the difficult change and the increased cost. It would make a lot of people's worklives easier, it would increase trust, it would improve confidence and morale. I'm not able to make that happen, unfortunately. If something good comes of this current crisis maybe more people will come round to this thinking?

It still is crossing a picket line - if classes were in person, you'd have to physically cross a picket line to get to every class. Its not unreasonable to equate the two, it's simply a fact. I am personally skipping classes in solidarity and joining picket lines, but i fully understand that some students will be severely harmed academically by doing so and i respect their decision not to skip. . . The only place you'll find GEO ""encouraging"" undergrads to skip classes is when they are asked how undergrads can help or when you go to their how to help page on their website. GEO has never ""requested"" that undergrads skip classes, it's simply been presented as one of multiple options for what undergrads who want to help in the strike should do. There's not GEO members posting on social media to skip classes or bullying people who don't. . . To briefly address a couple other points you made,. . First, as to why GEO isn't demanding academic forgiveness, it's not their responsibility to. Undergrads who skip classes are PARTICIPATING in the graduate strike, it's not our strike. If the university is saying their current demands fall outside of their contract, imagine how far out of their contract academic relief for undergrads is. . . Second, I can only speak for my personal experience, but emailing professors to tell them that i'm skipping class in solidarity has led to 2 of my professors changing their minds and deciding to cancel class for everyone (due to them receiving emails from a couple students). This does have a real impact. . . If GEO was out here shaming undergrads for going to class, shouting at people who physically (or virtually) cross their picket line, or demanding that all undergrads skip class, i'd be with you, but that isn't the case.

First, picketing in front of construction sites is a financial burden to the university because construction workers won't cross a picket line. Secondly, if we're accepting that u of m makes all its money from tuition for the purposes of debate, then the only way to financially impact them is to impact future enrollment (or drop out and get tuition refunded, but no ones arguing for that).

It's important to know that GEO has put pressure on the University to publicize their organizational ties with these two organizations to no avail. ICE raids on local restaurants in recent memory (e.g., Sava's in 2017) show that active participation between ICE and AAPD is evident. Close informal ties between campus police and AAPD/DPSS clearly exist; see the case of John Seto (current housing security head, chief of AAPD when the department killed a POC during a mental health crisis situation).. . A lot of this comes down to the general shadiness of UM. It's very similar to the in person opt-out issue. If it's really no problem to accommodate instructor preference, why not agree that a universal opt-out exists? If no organizational ties between campus police/DPSS and AAPD exist (really, could anyone even conceive of this possibility?) why not come out and say so?. .

While shooting her clearly is over the line and a distressing example of police brutality (when the other officer responding tased her), this seems less egregious than say the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. Furthermore, I do not see how the actions of a police chief could've prevented her death.

UM employees must declare whether or not they have been convicted of felonies, for example (which in many states could result from activities as innocuous as possession of cannabis, a crime for which people of color are far more likely to be arrested). UM students and employees must declare their immigration status (including visas). UM students and employees, ultimately, share an extremely large amount of personal data with the university. How are these data shared or used in a law enforcement context? If the university refuses transparency over these issues, how might you interpret this?. . Regarding ICE, you must understand that tensions are extremely high lately regarding the potential of the Trump admin to use ICE to fuck international students. See the actions this summer. We were all happy to see UM join the lawsuit in reaction to these measures. However, we are concerned the UM seems so reticent about committing to a policy of non-collaboration.. .

In addition to standard policing activities, we rely on DPSS to provide last resort deescalation services to assist our physicians and nurses in preventing violence in the hospitals. Critically, DPSS can often partner with physicians to exercise a non-violent, non-physical ""show of force"" that enables us to avoid employing physical or pharmacologic restraints on agitated patients who have resisted all efforts by their medical providers to cease threatening behavior to themselves, their families, their providers, and even other patients.. . Michigan Medicine is but one of the many other ""stakeholders"" in GEO's unilateral DPSS demand discussion that Dr. Schlissel alluded to in his email earlier today.. . By virtue of DPSS being comprised of fully deputized and professionally trained members of the law enforcement community, they are uniquely suited for these important, difficult, and delicate roles in our hospitals.

I think that like some people alluded here, the people that put up the anti-policing demands are guided by a specific historical and cultural moment in our society and haven't necessarily thought about the specifics of what this would look like. Anti-policing demands are fundamentally abolitionist demands that seek to remedy the effects of policing on minority communities. Realistically speaking, however, I think that radical anti-policing initiatives are a bourgeois pipe dream and fail to account for the immediate material consequences that a lack of policing might cause in communities that need it most. Its a very hard conversation to have, but not one that I see fit as part of a workers union.. . The complications also arise from anti-policing demands being pushed by a specific subset of relatively privileged stakeholders (grad students). My inkling is that there is very little working class support for radical abolitionist strategies. In fact, while numerous trades unions refused to cross GEO's picket line they've voiced their discontent about the anti-policing demands.. . So yes, pushing GEO to answer quite simple questions on this topic is probably not going to yield much because by definition it can't. The best that you'll get is; ""Well we'll defund DPSS and redirect that money to 'community initiatives' like more social workers, etc."" Laudable goal, but is it effective in uplifting communities?

First, it was not right of that person to physically block you from entering a campus building. That doesn't make any sense, and they certainly shouldn't have done it. Also, respect to Anne Curzan for contacting you personally, that rules.. . To my mind, there is one simple reason that there is huge unrest on campus right now: in the middle of a once in a century pandemic, the university is in many ways completely determined to treat this just like any other semester. I think a major point of the strikes is to demonstrate that the normal expectations just cannot be placed on students this semester. Students' education was profoundly disrupted before the strike, but the university refused to admit it. Why are you facing hard deadlines with only minimally adjusted grading policies? Why is there no serious effort at contact tracing, no randomized tests of asymptomatic people, and no basic precautions like temperature checks? You mention your experience in the dining hall -- the reason michigan dining staff were furious enough to walk out, despite extremely credible threats of firing, is that when you eat in a dining hall, your food has been handled by a long chain of people who did not get tested, and who after just 1 week have already accumulated hundreds of stories of people behaving ridiculously irresponsibly in their food lines. The dining staff say that the food fails basic health and safety requirements, the RAs say that the housing does too, and by the way the bus drivers have repeatedly said the same about campus transit. Out of the billions of dollars that the university spends every year, the billions that it has in reserves, and the billions it could easily secure in loans, why are so few resources being allocated to these basic and essential precautions?. . To be honest, things like degree timeline extensions for grad students are just trivia. Nobody wakes up for a 5 am picket under extremely credible threats of being fired, kicked out, sued, and in many cases deported because they think they might get a degree timeline extension. That would just be silly. What's driving people is a desire to tell the university that they can't just gaslight all of us into accepting that everything is completely normal. The university set its students up to fail by making them do all the same assignments for all the same classes as every other year (I guarantee most professors are using exactly the same syllabus as last year...), while living in unsafe houses, eating unsafe food, and paying even more for the privilege. Grad student strikes just happen to be the first tool that was brought out to encourage them to drop the charade already.. . I know this probably isn't comforting, and I'm sorry for that.

It's a false dichotomy to choose, full strike, or act like everything is normal. There is a middle ground. You can post social media, you can write emails, you can join the picket lines when you have time. Whatever support you can provide, will be appreciated. As advice for your classes, use youtube whenever you can. for math I used patrickjmt. I went to an R1 as an undergrad and profs sucked so I had to teach myself. based on my mentees responses, profs aren't the best teachers here either. . . . Second, I wanted to clarify that grad students who are striking do understand the risk. If you are striking, there is a risk to spread Covid. However, people are taking that risk to show the university how important this is. It seems paradoxical; however, keep in mind the strike is a last resort due to the university not caring. Many universities are fully remote, and there were calls by peer institutions, and by faculty to go fully remote. U of M didn't care. The university if citing of an informed health plan by health professionals, but professionals have urged for remote classes and the university has implicated themselves of supressing numbers. Part of Wednesday offer was to publicize the number of tests they perform and the positivity rate - meaning that they arent doing it now. It's important to understand, GEO striking isn't the root cause, it's a response to the indifference of admin on the student populations. I suspect the reason they are holding in person classes is to justify making students paying full price, but that's a conversations for another day. . . . Also not at as many graduate students are protected as one may think. Grad RA's can lose their jobs, and can be kicked out of grad school. Retaliation in academia is very real, and a professor or department can kick a student out because they don't like them (it's not uncommon). Geo can't protect against that. If the university really wanted to, they could fire grad student like UC Santa cruz did last year. Additionally, geo is primarily for gsi's. While phd students benefit, master students often don't recieve the benefits. And nor does international students (due to constant threat if they aren't a good worker, they'll be deported) . Still despite risk of losing it all, many students from these groups are willing to strike, highlighting the percieved importance of these provisions. . . . Third, Geo is trying to incorporate provisions for more groups. The strike started on Monday, and since then the strike has changed tremendously. People are using the weekend to reassess and figure things out. Before you pass judgement on Geo for not caring about undergrads, give it some time.

In short, it makes absolutely no sense to calculate tuition waivers into the total income of a graduate student. Why? Because as far as we can tell, tuition waivers represent **numbers on a page,** not actual budget items. The university generates an arbitrary number that represents the cost of a graduate student's education and ""waives"" it, i.e. makes it go away. They are formalities. Up until two or three years ago, the number wasn't even reported to the federal government. Certainly, we are not better compensated than your professor friends (for whom, ironically, you don't feel compelled to factor in benefits in calculating their total pay).. . Most importantly, universities pay graduate students not out of the goodness of their hearts, but because they need them. We are not unskilled labor. We are highly skilled labor, and large lecture courses, for example, would never be profitable without a steady stream of grad students to handle the heavy lifting for very little pay. The same argument, by the way, is valid for non-tenure track lecturers. . . Finally, the university needs us for that all important academic commodity of prestige. Taking in and turning out high calibre graduate students is one of the most important determining factors in a university's prestige. When we pursue our own research, it is not that we are being given a favor by the university -- we are quite literally sustaining its name and good reputation. In other contexts, we also hold up labs, field projects, inter-departmental collaborations, etc. . .

Why would the university run around paying less qualified individuals to teach classes at a rate approaching or exceeding professional, already-graduated, lecturers and professors? . . You can argue that tuition is ""just numbers on a page."" But, whether you want to believe it or not, it costs a lot of money to educate a graduate student. FTEs are expended by the faculty teaching your graduate classes, your thesis/dissertation committee, and most significantly your advisor, often for years. Add to that the immense administrative support network that every graduate student relies upon. Plus, the costs of the resources you use in the conduct of your learning and research. Then there are the broader overhead costs of running an institution, from admissions to graduation, that must be accounted for. . . I also take issue with your assertion that GSIs represent ""highly-skilled labor."" By definition, you are *learning* the majority of the skills you are being asked to employ, whether it be conducting research or teaching. Most graduate students have barely taught anything prior to their first GSI position. You can't seriously believe that the University is getting as much value out of GSIs compared to a lecturer or faculty member? Maybe I was seriously unlucky as an undergrad, but most of my younger GSIs were terrible. Most of them tried as hard as they could, but nothing can replace years of experience and training, both of which graduate students do not even come close to having compared to lecturers and faculty.. . I don't have good sources for average compensation packages for lecturers, the closest in rank and training to GSIs. Well, I should say, I don't really have time to find and vet those sources. Anyway, I am friends with a couple UM lecturers and at least one of them makes roughly $58k before benefits. If I am being incredibly generous, the University might be providing $10k in benefits per annum. In this case, this individual is making $68k full time. Take half of that and you get $34k. That means that graduate students are being paid $13k less in cash money every year, but are NOT having to pay tuition (a benefit not afforded to lecturers for obvious reasons). Maybe you don't value your UM education, but I certainly value my tuition at WELL over $13k per year.

If you cancelled then you do not have guaranteed housing for the rest of the year and would be forced to live in the expensive and very tight living quarters that is IV.

Which is often more like 30 - 40 hours a week of research (which in STEM benefits profs, grant income and more). In most cases, STEM PhD graduate students have to agree not to take another job as well, so is really ends up being 21k + benefits for 20 ""documented"" work hours, plus the minimum 20 to max 40 ""undocumented"" hours. . . As for the reason why ""waived"" is so frustrating for many students is after a few classes, we are still required to ""pay"" tution. For just doing our ""undocumented"" hours. So it doesn't feel like a real benefit. Its just a way the University can avoid actually ""paying"" that cost. If Universities paid graduate students enough to so they could cover their tution, they would actually lose money because in early years, a grad might have 12-16 credits, but that drops to 8 basically for the majority of a PhD time at university. So those PhD would make money off that extra income that would have covered the 12-16 units when they are only required the 8 (which is for the independent study aka research). So the tution waiving majority benefits the University. . . Course this isnt to say grads don't have better jobs than other people. But imho, more workers should be treated better.

For anyone who has never been on strike, I'll tell you right now there are much better ways to get $2500 than to risk getting fired, having your pay docked, possibly even having your degree progress attacked, and quite likely having your union legally dismantled for whenever you need it next. Some graduate student strikes are actually just about grad student funding (in fact, I had a bunch of my classes canceled [for a grad student funding strike](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/5gqjxx/the-university-of-toronto-basically-forced-its-tas-to-go-on-strike-for-some-reason-273) when I was an undergrad).

GEO members are made of two groups: the bargaining unit, which is all current GSI/GSSA and general members (all due paying graduate students).. . This is bit unusual, but is it because GEO can and does provide unofficial benefits to all graduate students, but officially only represents GSI/GSSA. . So, currently there are around 5000 general members and 1300 bargaining members (1070 at the start of the semester).. . In general all motions (i.e. actionable votes that don't involve contract or specific work changes like a strike) can be voted on by all present general members at the meeting. For example: sending out a strike vote. . . For contract or specific work related actions like a strike, only bargaining members can vote as it directly affects them in the moment. So the vote to strike can only be voted on by them, same as accepting an offer. . . The reason why general members don't vote in these action is because it is generally accepted that you cannot ask someone to risk their current position if you are not in a the same position (i.e. only a GSI can vote in matters that directly affect GSIs). . In a strike, only GSI union members are ""required"" to participate. I put required in quotes because GEO has historically been adamant that no bargaining members will be forced to strike. This is actually different in other unions, where no striking or crossing a picket line nets you a fine from the union.. . GEO general members, and any graduate students who are not GEO members (including non union GSIs) are encouraged to strike in solidarity but are not required too. . .

I was trying to clear up the statements you made. From your post it sounded like you were saying general members didn't get to vote on things they were allowed to vote on (such as the option for what was on the ballot- they did, and a full information packet was sent out before hand. Did they have to show up to the meeting? Yes. The same way the the faculty senate has to be present for vote of no confidence. So that's what set the ballot).

t1_g516iln,2020-09-13 03:16:53,t3_irpdmi,t3_irpdmi,"So I've seen similar issues on other Covid dashboards (including the one for the state of Michigan) and I *think* I know what's going on here (bear with me).. . First, new tests being added for last week is normal behavior, because they're reporting by the day the person was exposed or had symptoms, or (if that's not available) the day the test was conducted. I personally don't like dashboards that report this way (as opposed to just clearly reporting a new batch of results each day) but it's not an incorrect way to show the data.. . Second, the cutoff for each week's value is probably being tied to the time of day the graph is updated. In other words, say they update at 4AM on any given day: any tests before that time on the first day of each week are pushed to the previous week. Then when they update again at, say, 8PM, it will look like tests that occurred in between are also pushed ""backwards"" in time by a week. You can see this starting the week of 6/7 where the difference week-by-week appears to be +10, -8, +1, etc, but it mostly averages out over time. The dramatic and weird one is the week of 8/2, because 100 tests moved back and then it looks like they added a few (maybe some got reported late?) But with a time difference of 16 hours and a week where nearly 1000 tests were done, 100 in the space of 16 hours seems quite possible.. . Anyway, it is annoying and should probably be fixed, but it doesn't *appear* to be a malicious ""someone is manipulating the data"" situation. In plain English, someone wrote a query as ""right now minus 24-hour increments back to last Sunday"" instead of ""last Sunday at midnight"". Again this is all guesswork on my part, but I've noticed the Michigan dashboard has the same problem where all the prior data has some ""jitter"" depending on exactly what time of day it's updated.. .

Even if it is just an oversight board that meets for more than just complaints, or has student representation, or a committee of regents who review, or something along those lines. **Keeping the demands topical lets the University make the first move rather than the union, which means all options are on the proverbial table rather than being precluded by a set of restrictive demands or asks.**. . Basically that by listing specific demands the GEO might inadvertently close off bargaining avenues or topics. If they asked for ICE to stop coming to career fairs, the U could do that, and then throw up their hands and say they made so many concessions and refuse to move on anything else. So GEO leaves them general demands and wait for the U to set the parameters of discussion, giving GEO the upper hand in negotiation. My own personal theory is also that GEO never cared *exactly* how to sever ICE or AAPD ties, because what they really want is for policing to be recognized as a permissible topic for bargaining for worker safety, and a legitimate section of future bargaining platforms and negotiations. Doing so would be an **enormous** win that gets their foot in the door and establishes precedent.. . In this sense, GEO has the University backed into a corner. A few hypotheticals for how things play out:. . * If the U bargains on policing, GEO wins a permissible subject, and a very strong precedent for future platforms.. . * If the U refuses to bargain on policing, they look bad nationally if GEO can draw sufficient attention to the AAPD murder of Aura Rosser, and add her name to the dozens of others who were killed by police. This taps into hot national debates currently. GEO can beat the war drum that the U doesn't care about member demands anyway, and come out with some type of win for their membership.. . * The U refuses to bargain on policing, but capitulates elsewhere in the strike demands and gives the GEO strong protections and remote teaching options, child care improvements, and international center coverage. GEO leaves with a win for their membership.. . * Both sides drag it out, and we will (likely) see a case increase in Ann Arbor that results in a shift to remote semester anyway and validates the public health demands, and policing is dropped mutually. There is no real winner here because this is dangerous, but GEO is vindicated in their concern for public health.. . * Schlissel gets a vote of no confidence from faculty this coming week.. . Of course there are some bad things that could also end the strike for the Union without any movement on anything. But. I think they're longer shots that *seem* less likely.

If DPSS is perpetuating excessive force against UM community members, then by all means work to correct this, including simply firing the offending officer. But, I really feel as though many in the UM community are putting the cart before the horse here and presuming guilt before any evidence is brought forth. If we want to disarm the DPSS, this is a discussion that can be had with ALL members of the UM community, not simply a small group of graduate students who are, most likely, NOT interacting with DPSS nearly as much of other valued members of the University community.. . Regardless of the disarming argument, GEO is demanding budget cuts that are likely greatly disproportionate to what it would take to disarm DPSS.

Big reasons that I hear classically invoked as to why the endowment shouldn't be used in temporary emergency scenarios include 1) the endowment should be reserved for long-term capital projects where the return on investment is often many fold (e.g. a new campus building) and 2) (relatively) short term emergency situations like pandemics are national/worldwide by nature and there are other piles of money to use - this is the road repair argument used by pretty much every city in the county (wait to do any road repair until federal matching funds show up). Finally, the biggest reason 3) is that the endowment is invested - pulling money out, particularly in a crap economy, is very harmful to the endowment's financial position.. .

You are catching us -- the university, the country, and the people on this subreddit -- at a difficult time.

And some come to seriously discuss important and difficult issues we are currently facing, and on which there are deep disagreements in the community, and so these exchanges can also come off as negative. It's a stressful time, and so the prevalence of such posts is higher (and if you check out the subreddits for other universities, you'll likely find some of the same content). But I hope you are also seeing that the debates, however contentious, are for the most part genuine. And that people having difficulties or looking for information are finding support, whether factual (help with finding documents and resources in a university that is big, and it's sometimes hard to find information and resources unless someone with experience points you in the right direction), educational (people forming study groups), or simply emotional.. . The other is something that might be practically useful to think about, if it applies to your circumstances: You didn't mention explicitly that you are currently in your home country, but I am assuming you are. If, come Winter, you are still in a position where you aren't ready to move to the US, you can enroll in your grad program remotely -- and if you are not physically in the US, you can do it part time. So, you can take one or two classes, instead of the full load, which will cost you less in tuition. You can get some experience of what the coursework is like, and what the university's resources can offer, even remotely, but at a ""discount.""

Over the course of the year, bargaining is done between the House, Senate, and Governor. The latest concrete evidence of bargaining that I've seen is from news reports in Freep from late June / early July, which, to my reading, continue to indicate that the 2.5% increase has remained in the budget proposal. (The state's official website I linked above further indicate this to be the case.). . Based on previous years information, the best I can tell is that Michigan congress typically votes on a final budget in September and it must be signed by September 30 / October 1 by the Governor to avoid the state going into default. I imagine they are in the final portions of this process now. To that end, I haven't seen any major news pieces suggesting the increase in university funding is a sticking point at this late stage. If anything, there seem to be a few news reports that Michigan's anticipated losses are actually lower than they had originally anticipated.. . I agree with you that some of the financial planning being done by UM has likely been in anticipation of a reduction in their state funding.

t1_g56bi9n,2020-09-13 22:53:20,t1_g4zvxsf,t3_icamuy,"TL;DR: A lack of transparency, poor testing, and flat out lying make it really hard to know how well we're doing. No plan for shutting down, sketchy stuff going on with CARES Act money and case reporting, even to the state and county departments of health. We're most likely fucked but there's no reliable way to know for sure. . . . 1. So far, we have 469 cases on record. Over 150 of those were from the last 7 days. [https://protect.purdue.edu/dashboard/](https://protect.purdue.edu/dashboard/) Testing is a random 10% of campus once per week, and any person who has been in contact with someone with a documented case, who is experiencing symptoms, and who wants a test can go get one. Important to note that surveillance testing doesn't include faculty or staff, though they can opt to get tested that's rare. So really, not enough testing to know how much of the university population actually has COVID.. 2. The information on the dashboard where they publish the numbers is updated irregularly and I've heard many stories from friends who are in IT and healthcare staff that the numbers are deflated. This is consistent with the documented fact that the county department of health and Purdue's reported numbers don't line up, and haven't since the beginning of the semester.. 3. There's still a lot of space for on-campus quarantining. That's because most of the cases are in students who are quarantining off-campus, like in a Greek house, co-op or apartment. As of right now, 27 Greek houses are in quarantine. Many are still hosting (illicit) parties.. 4. As of last week, Purdue has distributed only about 12% of their CARES Act funds, while other Big 10 universities have done \~65-95%. Nobody is quite sure why, or where that money is going. A graduate student advocacy group and the student paper blew the whistle on this, and managed to get the $800 fee for quarantining on campus reversed.. 5. There is no plan on how the university will re-close, or what the criteria for doing so are. . 6. Classes are in-person, hybrid, or online. Only 12% of undergrad courses are online, and very few of those are for juniors/seniors. So most undergrads don't really have a choice but to come back in person. Sanitizing and spacing in the classrooms is very inconsistent. Admin said they would update HVAC to improve circulation but that is a flat-out lie.. 7. Our university president, Mitch Daniels, has built a reputation for himself as a higher-ed reform genius (read: austerity politics => big cuts to staff and humanities departments, which has fund an 8-yr-long tuition freeze for in-state students at the expense of everything else). Most of the grad students, faculty, and staff I interact with think that he will keep us in person regardless of body count or how many outright lies he has to tell the public...and aims to do so without spending all of the CARES act funding we were allocated, because, ""Purdue is so special we don't need government handouts.""

One of the main reasons I didn't go back to campus was the amount of anxiety I had about covid when in-person class was still a thing. I'd been following the news of the virus from overseas closely starting around the end of Christmas break when it was really gaining traction. As everything progressed and it became clear it wasn't going to be an isolated epidemic, I began to get really worried. About a week before spring break I remember one day walking back from class and thinking about the covid situation and how everyone was pretty much laughing it off/making jokes about it at the time. I saw everyone I was passing on the street and thought about how the US hadn't shut down air travel (and I think the \~2 week incubation period had been mentioned by then?) and I literally teared up while walking because I was scared that someone around me could have the virus. When I got home I started bawling and my housemates told me not to worry and that covid wouldn't get to the US (because that's what everyone thought at the time, and what I thought I should be thinking). I probably should add that a lot of my anxiety when thinking about the possibility of a pandemic stemmed from me having watched the movie Contagion in 2011, which gave me nightmares for like a month after lol. . \^\^Sorry, I didn't expect that to be such a long tangent but what I'm trying to say is that imo your anxiety is completely valid. There are definitely ways to safely socialize, but I know how weird it can feel to want to be cautious while surrounded by people blatantly ignoring public health guidelines. You always picture something like a global pandemic to be a lot more earth-shattering and something that totally disrupts life as we know it, so looking around and seeing things be more or less normal can feel really weird, like you're the crazy one for being scared to go out, take off your mask in groups, etc.",10.0,negative,0.6151322722434998

You are correct, a student needs to be enrolled and *in the US* for two semesters to be eligible for Curriculum Practical Training, which is what you need to work in the US while an international student. This is a concern for students starting in the Winter who were hoping for a summer internship. An exception is made if an industry internship is part of the curriculum requirements of your program (i.e., every student needs to complete one to graduate) -- you need to find out whether it's the case.. . In terms of classes offered in the Winter, the schedule of classes should become available on November 9th at the latest. The department can still make changes after that, but since it's the start date of ""backpacking"" (which is a sort of official course planning process at UM), they try not to, unless there is a true urgency of some sort. You can look at what courses were offered in the Winter semesters in the last couple of years here: https://ro.umich.edu/calendars/schedule-of-classes, but obviously, this year things are running very differently, so it's not a perfect predictor.. . Lastly, you should communicate your questions and concerns to the graduate program advisor at the school, or someone with a similar title (it was probably the person, or group of people, who were in touch with you when you were admitted to the program). The are usually the best with helping students navigate the program, including those in non-traditional circumstances.

When I was in hs I had to do mock strikes for 2 of my classes and one of the main things they said about demands was 1) make them excess so you can settle on what you want and not less (like OP said) and 2) make sure the excess demands are still on-topic and relevant to the *cause* of the strike. . . From my experience the strike was instigated by the COVID response by the university and not with policing/DPSS. I understand that the emphasis on police restructuring is relevant to the entire world currently, but was this an actual reason for the initial strike? Why weren't the ""extra"" demands just more intense demands related to COVID? Some of my friends have pointed out that it almost makes it seem like the organizers thought they didn't have a enough case with COVID response to strike so that they needed another hot topic to seem more serious (ie DPSS). . Now, my question is was there a big conflict already between the union/students and DPSS? If there was then I have just entirely missed it and I can understand the relevancy. If not, then I'm confused on those demands and if someone could explain their importance to this *specific* strike then I would greatly appreciate it. . . Again, I am genuinely curious.

GEO didn't get any of their demands on this issue during the last bargaining cycle. . . - It was initially suggested that armed DPSS members would patrol AA and campus with the undergraduate ""Ambassadors"" to police mask use and social distancing. That's some really fucked up Stalin-level shit. . . - Policing demands do have something to do with workplace conditions. Study after study show that even the most well-intentioned cops have biases that disproportionately affect black, indigenous, and people of color. GEO members who are more likely to be unjustly targeted have voiced numerous concerns about this issue (note: I'm white). The bottom line is you can't feel safe at work (or like it's a fair workplace) if you know that you're more likely to be arrested than your colleague of another race. . . - DPSS receives funding from the government that allows them to purchase military equipment. That's not cool IMO. . . - It's incredibly difficult to initiate police reform from the inside, hence the motivation to push for it from the outside. . . - The guy who was chief of police when AAPD killed a disabled black woman is now head of housing security.

GEO wants to ensure situations like this don't occur on campus by reassigning things like mental health crises to those who are more trained for it (like social workers) and feel more comfortable dealing with people in that situation.

But that language is not necessarily informed or thoughtful. . . You on the other hand do seem thoughtful. You're finding your comfort level and balancing risk mitigation with other pressures. Maybe you're not always landing at a place that feels comfortable or complies with current guidance. But you can get better at this, and still socialize. It sucks that so much of the stuff that makes college and Ann Arbor great has to change. It's normal to be sad or pissed about that. I also believe you can make the best of it and find alternatives that aren't stupid or anxiety-making.. . Managing this after coming back to Ann Arbor can seem overwhelming, and advice comes from all over, but got back to the basics which are pretty consistent: Mask up, wash hands, stay six feet away from people as much as possible unless they're in your pod, if you get closer than that keep it under 15 minutes, outside is better than inside, etc. Monitor yourself for symptoms but a once-a-day check is enough.

In March every trip to Meijer was like ""OMG I AM GOING TO DIE"" and now we throw on our masks, get our stuff doing all the new routines, and there's no longer that feeling of doom.. .

I have a friend who travels to see her elderly parents every weekend, and I have heard her tell people she's got to be more careful because of that. This is true. People accept this, they don't hassle her to take her mask off or sit closer, or accept their invitation to go somewhere iffy. Yet at the same time they don't think she's making a statement about their own choices. In your shoes, if I felt like people were going to give me shit about my safe choices, I'd tell people my doc told me to be a little more vigilant due to [insert condition here] or that I might have to travel home to see a relative soon, or whatever.. .

t1_g5bbz7w,2020-09-15 02:06:00,t1_g5bb6fr,t3_istw80,"Oh lemme fix that for you, copy-pasted here:. . ---. . Dear University of Michigan Ann Arbor Graduate Students:. . As you most likely already know, the Graduate Employees' Organization (GEO) intends to strike starting tomorrow, Tuesday, September 8, 2020. We learned only today that the Union will strike tomorrow. I write now, to explain some of the issues we have been discussing with GEO, to affirm the importance of graduate student perspectives and student activism at the University of Michigan but also to inform you that if you are a GSI or GSSA, it is the University's hope and expectation that you will continue to perform the important work that you do to serve our undergraduate students, other graduate students and the rest of the University. Although graduate students who are members of GEO may have voted to strike, individual graduate students are not obligated or required to strike. We expect all employees, including our graduate instructors, to fulfill their employment obligations fully and faithfully and are asking you not to engage in this work stoppage. There are other ways to engage with university leadership, and to have a voice.. . Some of you may not be aware that a strike would be illegal. Under Michigan law, public employees, including graduate student employees, may not strike. In addition, GEO's recently signed contract (April 2020), which covers all GSIs and GSSAs, also prohibits them and the Union from interfering with the University's operations, including through a strike. Both Michigan law and the collective bargaining agreement stipulate that the way for GEO to affect change on the important issues it has raised in the past several weeks, must be through discussions with the University (e.g. bargaining) on employment-related issues and not by withholding services.. . The law also stipulates that this bargaining can take place only on issues related to the employment of GSIs, not on issues related to your status as a student or issues relevant to the broader University community. GEO's strike is based on a number of issues, many of which are not related to the wages, hours, and working conditions of GSIs and GSSAs. However, as noted below, we understand that these issues are extremely important to many in our community; I certainly affirm the rights of graduate students to voice their perspectives and concerns, and note that there are a range of ways to do so.. . Nonetheless, the University's representatives and GEO's representatives have been working diligently since June, including all weekend, to address the concerns GEO has raised and to avert the potential illegal strike. In particular, GEO's representatives have met multiple times with representatives from my office, Academic Human Resources, Rackham Dean Mike Solomon, the International Center leadership, and our public health experts. We believe progress has been made on key issues, including those that do relate to employment concerns. Unfortunately, and despite our efforts, GEO has expressed its intention to strike tomorrow.. . The University also continues its work on a number of important issues that concern the overall graduate student experience. We recognize the challenges many graduate students are facing that may have impeded their academic progress. Rackham Graduate School has been evaluating the time-to-degree policy for doctoral students, in light of Covid-19 impacts. This topic will be addressed in the upcoming September 14 State of the Graduate School event. We have also been very concerned about the additional visa, travel and other difficulties many of our international students are confronting. Our International Center is focused on efforts to expand its operations, including adding staff as their needs dictate, in order to address the needs of our international students.. . And, of course, our public health experts are working nearly around-the-clock to ensure we take necessary and prudent steps throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. We announced this past week a surveillance testing program to help us detect and contain spread of COVID-19. We recognize that there is a range of views on each of these issues, and are expanding opportunities for engagement and to share information across campus. These are complex issues that require thoughtful deliberations, much analysis, and cannot be solved shortsightedly.. . Let me briefly address two specific issues raised by GEO during impact negotiations - the universal right to work remotely without documentation and the availability of the child care subsidy without regard to the licensed status of the provider. The University feels it has addressed both of these issues. First, we are not aware of any graduate student who is being required to teach in person against their expressed preference. Faculty and GSIs have been treated identically under the guidance put forth by my office. Second, the University recognizes that due to the pandemic there are increased child care needs and is providing support through the CARES funding for Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students (https://obp.umich.edu/mandatory-reporting/cares-act-reporting/) and through dedicated Rackham Financial Aid for child care, including unlicensed facilities. These funds are available to all students facing challenges during the pandemic and supplement the child care subsidy for licensed facilities available through the Office of Financial Aid.. . I end by reaffirming my commitment to working collaboratively to create and maintain a university environment in which graduate students - and all members of our community - can thrive. This certainly includes building on our efforts to combat racism, as an essential priority for our university, and to provide an education rooted in the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.. . I hope you will join me in reaffirming your commitment to the UM mission to deliver a world-class education, safely and effectively.. . Best,. . Susan M. Collins.

Our proposal yesterday included a commitment that the International Center will add to its staff so it can enhance its support for international students, including graduate students who are a large part of the caseload of the center. This additional support will assist in case management and communication, among other issues, given the complexity of issues faced by international students in the current environment.. . Child care:. . GEO demanded that the student Child Care Subsidy program administered by the Office of Financial Aid, temporarily remove the licensed child care requirement of the subsidy and expand the age limit of the subsidy.. . The University agreed in its proposal to institute the following temporary program to expand the University's existing student child care subsidy program to address the impacts of the pandemic.. . Extend the policy to include an option for funding unlicensed child care for all students at 67% of the rate of funding for licensed child care under the regular program.. In support of the expansion of the child care subsidy, the university committed an additional $300,000 to fund unlicensed child care for all students for the two terms. This is in addition to the current child care subsidy available to all students for licensed child care.. Testing/modeling: . . GEO demanded that the University provide more information and greater transparency on the University's testing policy, contact tracing, and campus safety.. . Over the weekend, University leadership and GEO met with public health experts to explain further the University's testing program. The University then affirmed in its proposal yesterday that it will be, at a minimum, taking the following steps regarding communication of data to the broader University community:. . We will describe in detail the methodology of our surveillance testing program, including how we plan to diminish the bias introduced by an opt-in approach. This will be posted on the Campus Blueprint website.. We will make public our surveillance testing capacity weekly, as well as the actual number of tests performed, number of positive tests and the positivity rate. We will try to post the latter info as it becomes available with the goal of posting data each weekday.. We do not have a model that predicts infection rates with sufficient reliability and cannot commit to providing these data as we are uncertain when or if it will become available. If reliable data do become available they will be communicated to the broader University community. Faculty members in SPH who are working on modeling will be free to publish or present their work when they think it is ready.. We will explain on the Campus Blueprint website or other appropriate website the set of metrics we are tracking and the approach that will be used to determine whether to pull back from in-person instruction. See additional detail here.. The university is providing a multi-layered approach to testing designed by some of the state's top public health experts. The university also has a dashboard, updated daily, that provides transparency on the testing all across the Ann Arbor Campus. The Community Sampling and Tracking program, which will test as many as 3,000 community members each week by the end of September, is the latest addition to the university's multi-tiered testing and monitoring strategy, which includes:. . Baseline testing of nearly 6,000 students before they moved into Michigan Housing, as well as testing of residents of affiliated fraternity or sorority facilities.. Symptomatic testing of students through University Health Service and of faculty and staff through Occupational Health Services.. Exposure testing for close contacts identified though case investigation, contact tracing or workplace exposure investigations.. Antibody testing for Michigan Medicine faculty and staff involved in patient care.. Daily symptom tracking through the ResponsiBLUE health screening tool.. Read additional details here.. . Other health and safety concerns for those involved in in-person teaching:. . GEO has demanded that every GSI be given the universal option to teach remotely at any point during the semester.. . The University proposed a formalized mechanism for GSIs and GSSAs to bring forward, either through their individual academic unit or through academic human resources, health and safety concerns in the classroom as they might arise throughout the term. The agreement allowed for GSIs and GSSAs to request a temporary switch to remote instruction should the issue not be immediately resolved and while the parties further evaluated and addressed the employees concerns. The agreement also provided an expedite grievance meeting in order to reach resolution as quickly as possible.. . The University also provided clarification and guidance mask enforcement in the classroom, including clarifying the right of all instructional faculty to cancel class in the event a student refuses to wear a mask after being asked.. . The University reiterated its commitment to appropriate COVID-19 supplies needed in the classroom, by agreeing to send additional communications in the units on how to access these supplies.. . Additional time to degree:. . GEO has demanded that every graduate student be granted an additional year of time to complete their degree, as well as an additional year of graduate student funding.. . We understand and share the concerns of graduate students about the impacts of COVID on their academic progress. As these issues involve more than just GSIs and GSSAs and pertain to the academic status of graduate students, they will be and are being addressed by the Rackham Graduate School and the individual schools and colleges.. . Nevertheless, in the interests of seeking resolution to the concerns, GEO, representatives from the Provost's Office and Rackham Dean Michael Solomon met over the Labor Day weekend so GEO could provide their concerns to Dean Solomon. Dean Solomon heard the concerns, understands the issues and is working to address them.. . Rackham announced in a Sept. 4 email to graduate students that it will be addressing this issue in a town hall hosted by Dean Solomon on Monday, Sept.14.. . Police practices:. . GEO demanded access to a disarmed and demilitarized workplace, where lethal weapons are prohibited, our security services do not receive military funding, there is transparency around the use of surveillance technology, there is a standard of force for campus police, and no one faces retaliation for being unable to work due to police presence.. . The University acknowledges that this is an important issue for the broader university community, and thus should and will be part of a broader discussion to include multiple stakeholders. These also are issues that society at large is facing as we grapple with not only a pandemic, but also continuing racial discrimination and great disparities in our society. The University has addressed and will continue to address these issues in multiple venues with the many stakeholders. We acknowledge that we're unable to bargain with one employee group for matters that affect the entire campus community and other people's employment terms.. . Retaliation:. . The University agreed it would withdraw the unfair labor practice charge filed against GEO and not discipline or penalize employees who engaged in the strike should the parties reach agreement and the strike be ended.",2.0,error,0.0

From a strategic perspective GEO made wild policing demands **in addition** to reasonable labor demands so that, in the best case, *widely popular* policing reform happens, and in a lesser case, the university has the opportunity to save face and acquiesce to the reasonable labor demands. Either GEO comes out of this with a solid chunk of their labor demands met, or the university throws *everything* out and looks foolish/unreasonable to both GEO and the broader student body. To be entirely blunt, the policing demands are tactically useful for the sake of compromise during negotiations as they provide a buffer against losing core labor and COVID demands, even if the policing demands themselves are not met.. . And, as a reminder: undergrad support for the strike is still **far** above the threshold for majority, and now that RA's have joined, the ""credibility [the strikers] have Lost"" is being recovered and reinforced by direct personal testimony of shitty university practices and policies directly affecting ALL of on-campus housing. This is no longer a strike solely about grievances that only exist in the abstract for undergrads; there are relevant and widely-relatable safety concerns for all on-campus undergrads being spoken about in addition to the labor and policing demands.. . Thirdly, by saying ""the strikers would have much more credibility if they dropped [XYZ] demands"": congratulations! You've joined a long line of union-busters who've used the exact same rhetoric to try and muddy the waters about the objectives of labor unions in bad faith. Unfortunately for you, GEO *did* try petitioning for much of the reasonable labor stuff without the policing demands all the way back in F19/W20 iirc, pre-COVID. Didn't work, which is exactly why it's still being folded in to the current demand structure. The COVID stuff is new, obviously.. .

I can tell you what I think the issue is, for what that is worth.. . The administration has a tendency to be fiscally conservative, think in the long-term, and consistently pursue prestige/excellence. Each of these things can be both good and bad. It shapes many of the things that students experience, although it may not be very obvious to them.. . When you are fiscally conservative, you tend to consider worst-case scenarios. You may prioritize savings and reserves. You may tend to overestimate how much revenue (such as tuition) you will need to cover expenses.. . When you think long-term, you put weight on the downstream effects of decisions made today. It may also put you at regular odds with students, whose affiliation with the institution is typically shorter-term. They will not experience the future version on the University; they are understandably more interested in what the University is and does right now. . . When you pursue prestige and excellence, you may be reluctant to fully enter ""hunker down"" or lean operations mode in crisis. You are thinking strategically about opportunities to enhance the University today and in the future. You may prioritize having funds to pursue important initiatives.. . This shapes how they decide a lot of things. Consider tuition. How do these modes of thinking explain why we had a tuition increase in a year when many institutions decided to cut families a break and not do it? . . Because the University didn't know how bad things might get but assumed lower enrollment, big new costs, a state cut, etc. (fiscal conservativism). . . Because freezing tuition leads to a smaller base for all future increases, meaning the University would have to increase by a big margin in the future. Because converting endowment funds into operations funds (to replace tuition) means there will be lower endowment funds in the future. (Long-term focus). . Because they wanted enough funds to increase aid. Because they want to still be able to hire/retain top faculty, expand library collections, launch new majors, etc. Because they want funds to shore up areas where the University needs serious work (compliance, sexual misconduct, mental health resources) because leaving them unaddressed is an ongoing threat to UM's fiscal health and/or reputation (Pursuing prestige/excellence).. . I have a more concrete example of how this played out in the past. During the last serious fiscal crisis, UM had some big tuition increases. Students definitely feel these today because they made their tuition higher. But they also feel these in other ways, since those increases let UM launch new programs and do other things like increase aid to reduce loan burdens. A really big thing they did? They hired a bunch of faculty. Universities across the country were doing hiring freezes, cutting programs, slashing benefits, etc. There were a lot of restless faculty out there and UM scooped up a bunch, it was a huge strategic opportunity. If UM hadn't done this, classes would probably be larger and there might be fewer cool faculty to learn from and work with, fewer big research grants making things possible, fewer star faculty boosting our rankings. This isn't necessarily visible to students because (a) what kind of student looks at decisions from ten years ago and (b) there's no alternative view of what UM would have been like without it.. . I can point to the positives that came from that hiring, but there were negatives too. Big one: students paid more tuition and still are. Students could legitimately complain that in a time of fiscal crisis UM should have buckled down and not hired faculty. Plus there were many opportunity costs. UM could have agreed to a more generous GSIs contract at that time, for example.. . Back to philosophies: Other leaders at other institutions may have a different focus or may choose different solutions. Just like UM, their decisions will have both positive and negatives. Maybe UM's approach can be described as ""corporate"" or capitalist in nature -- I don't really have a handle on the labels, but am more interested in how viewpoints play out in University decision-making.. .

The rotten and incompetent behavior is on the part of several of the top administrators, deans, and regents (and the faculty who support them). The actions of these admins are threatening to undermine that. . . Regarding ""non-COVID demands"", it's important to note that many GEO members view the COVID and anti-racism / police abolition demands as inextricably linked. It may not be obvious to those of us who haven't had to think about it until more recently (speaking for myself, I'd been pretty oblivious prior to ~2018). Some SPH faculty wrote this Op-Ed explaining how policing is a public health issue: https://www.michigandaily.com/section/columns/op-ed-policing-public-health-issue..

The ability to earn letter grades that affect your GPA and evidence your course performance on your transcript is incredibly important. It's part of why universities implement pass-fail only policies so sparingly. The only reason pass-fail was made the default grading scheme in the Winter is because we were hit during the middle of the semester by a once-in-a-century pandemic that completely upturned university operations across the world. And even then, UofM allowed students to opt back to a letter grading scheme. That provision alone, in the midst of the most upturned semester in perhaps the university's history, should tell you how important letter grades are. . . The big difference from a purely remote standpoint between Winter 2020 and Fall 2020 is that we actually knew (with some expected uncertainty) what to expect prior to starting this semester. We also still have some time before the pass-fail declaration deadline ends. If the strike is impacting a student to the extent that they are very concerned and would prefer their courses to be pass-fail, the good news is that they can do so on their own accord. You have to remember that many students are not having courses impacted in any way by this strike, and even more students only have one or two that are affected. It was also one thing for UofM to go down the pass-fail route during Winter 2020 when essentially every big school was doing something similar for that semester. However, were UofM to implement something like that again - and be the only university doing so - they would effectively be undercutting their own students and more specifically those students' job and graduate school prospects. . . You're essentially calling for students to be punished by asking for this. We already have an alternative grading scheme this semester that literally only serves to benefit everyone (letter grades for C and above, and NRC for D and below). With this in mind - in combination with the fact that we have not yet even reached the pass-fail deadline - there is no legitimate reason to be asking for this.

Although as shitty as that sounds, it could be a negotiating tactic, to remind GEO that they are breaking their contract and state laws so that they relax some of their demands. I don't condone that, and I think that the university shouldn't be doing it because it makes everything more inflammatory and less likely to build consensus.. . But my point is, I don't think it's simply that the university wants to crush GEO. GEO has shown that they're powerful clearly, so the university is responding in kind. I think that's the wrong approach from the university, because the should be building consensus, but also if GEO came out with more straightforward proposals they could've sat down and talked it over sooner. I am curious about the whole deal though - it really feels like there's no communication between the sides, and there just needs to be.

It is understandable to be upset and frustrated by that, whether you're one of the affected people or not. . . I think it overstates things to say that ""everyone"" is being fucked over. You don't have to be furious on behalf of everyone, because not everyone is being screwed.. . There are students who are finding ways to have a good term. . There are faculty that are having a fulfilling semester teaching. . There are staff that are making a difference and happy about it. . There are people thrilled that football is back on the menu. . . Perhaps these people seem loony or misguided to you, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.. . Can I offer some perspective and maybe some optimism? I've been here a while and I have seen the University go through a lot of turmoil. Some things bigger than others. The student code of conduct. #BAMN. GEO protests and LEO negotiations and work stoppages where the language is just as combative as now. Fury over coaching hires. The Ed Martin scandal. Divestiture disagreements. Poor handling of sexual assault cases--way too many of these. . . This is a big diverse place that has always attracts people with strong passions and principles they're willing to fight for. Faculty, staff, and students routinely hold UM to a high standard and call it out when it thinks it falls short. And in the end, stuff gets worked out. This is the most divided I've seen campus, but I still think in the end we'll land in a spot where we can move forward. Most leadership are not here for ""profit""--if they were, they're in the wrong line of work. They want the university to succeed and students to have a good experience and faculty to feel fulfilled and so on--they just are following a different roadmap. You may think they are profoundly misguided in their choices, I get it. . . When people believe in a place and the good it can do, it will come through even times of great dissent, even after making mistakes or taking too long to fix what's broken. UM can too. UVa survived the Drago-Sullivan dispute. MSU has survived Nassar. Duke still plays Lacrosse. UNC survived the shame of its academics issues with athletes. Illinois survived its admissions-influence scandal. Missouri has survived its severe race issues. Baylor, holy cow too much to list, still standing. Penn State & Sandusky--still around. Multiple colleges emerged from the Varsity Blues Scandal. [it is depressing how many of these are around sexual misconduct]. .

It's also a violation of GEO's contract. However, it is not a criminal penalty, but a civil one. The most likely people to be impacted are GEO officers. In the current contract (and in most of our contracts since our founding) GEO has agreed to a ""no strike"" clause, which states that we will not conduct any action that interferes with UM operations. This includes the withholding of labor. If GEO strikes when the contract is in force, the organization may not be able to collect dues. We would also be open to lawsuits and could be forced to pay damages. If the contract is not in force, the likelihood of a lawsuit is lower, but UM could still get a court order for us to stop striking and if we do not obey it, the coordinators of the strike (the GEO officers) could be placed under arrest.. . . . Say what you will about the illegality of the strike, GEO never tried to hide that from its members, and it was very regularly discussed at meetings. It was well known that the university could bust the union if it wanted to.

I think that paints a pretty good picture of what might be in store for people who have contracted COVID.. . Regarding what I said about people ""testing positive"" without actually being tested, it was because when they registered to be tested, there was a long queue to actually get the test. They had registered, but left the line early because it was so long. They got a call two days later saying they'd tested positive.. . Why have such false positives been allowed to happen? I'm really not sure. I'm a CS student, so I'm unfamiliar with even standard protocol for any kind of large scale testing. Based on information that I have read though, which again has the possibility of being misleading or flat our wrong, it seems like hospitals receive more funding if they have more COVID patients. Since hospitals are essentially businesses in the US (a totally different discussion that would drag this post out even longer) there is an incentive for them to inflate their numbers to get more government money.. . Do I believe that is happening at the scale that some people are suggesting? No, I don't. UM's hospital for example openly states that they only have 19 (or very close to that as of last week) positive inpatients. However, it's not a stretch to imagine a situation where hospital executives fudge numbers if that means they get more money.. . Another explanation, and a much simpler one at that, could be incompetence. Most testing facilities are thrown together as quickly as possible, and they're trying to test as many people as they can.

I have asthma, I have a family history of heart problems, and I have respiratory allergies. I am the poster child for the ""high-risk"" young population, but that does not mean that I cannot question the severity of this pandemic.. . If you look at the data, the death rate for COVID-19 is very low. According to Johns Hopkins, in the US, the [observed case-fatality ratio is only 3%](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality). However, as many have and will point out, there is a lack of testing in many places, including here in Ann Arbor. This would inflate the death rate because we are not catching all of the cases, but we are catching all of the deaths (unless it is the case that we are not accounting for dead people, which I have no evidence to support). In reality, the true death rate is likely even lower. It becomes a scenario where the more you accuse leadership of not testing enough, the more you have to acknowledge that it drives the death rate down. We should be testing twice as many people? Well then the death rate must be cut in half. Ten times as many tests? Ten times lower death rate.. . Another interesting fact is the large disparity in death rates between people over and under 55. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm), \~92% of all COVID-19 related deaths are people over 55, \~79% are over 65, and \~57% are over 75. These populations make up \~29%, \~16%, and \~7% of the US population, respectively. The vast, vast majority of fatalities are from a small percentage of our population.. . Does this mean that we should just lift all restrictions? Absolutely not. You and I both know that the deaths and cases would both be much higher if we did that. But after months of research and data, it is becoming clear, at least to me, that this disease is very serious to a small proportion of our population. For the rest, it is a sickness which comes and goes, and major complications can be handled with the excellent health networks around the country.. . I understand this issue is very touchy for a lot of people, which is why I wanted an open dialogue about this. I recognize that I, while a part of the essential worker population and also more at risk than most for my age, have implicit biases and assumptions from my own background and upbringing.

If I got something wrong or missed something important, please let me know. . . There seems to be one point of confusion here: I am not part of GEO. I am a PhD student on fellowship, so I am not eligible to be part of the union. My backing of the union is largely ideological, which is most of what I want to talk about today. Not their specific demands or handling, but the importance of their right to strike when they feel something is wrong, and the university's duty to make them feel heard. . . I really would like to say that the university has been acting anti-labor this year. Their attitude seems to lean more towards squashing than addressing concerns. Maybe in the interest of trying to find common ground and stick to my point about supporting the union's right to strike, I can at least try to convince you that the university has not been particularly \*pro\*-labor. I'll try to give some examples off the top of my head of what would have made me feel less frustrated and more like they were listening.. . The biggest issue from the beginning was that many groups at the university asked for more widespread testing. The university explained being limited by their capacity (very fair), and GEO responded with wanting to test at a higher percentage of that stated capacity (also fair). Testing rates became a key component of the strike. An example of being pro-labor would be if the university sat down with GEO leadership and either had a very good explanation for why they are not testing that much or committed to testing at a certain rate in the immediate future.. . Another big demand was all-online classes; some GSIs felt unsafe teaching in-person and did not feel it was a real choice for them not to. An example of a pro-labor move (not to be confused with a pro-gamer move lol) in this situation would be the University funding graduate students this year who opt-out of teaching in-person, even if that leaves the student without a GSI position. That would make the students less likely to feel pressure from their advisors. I would like to use this as an example of lateral thinking where the university addresses concerns without necessarily caving to every demand. I'm trying to illustrate that the administration could disagree with the demands, but still sympathize and act on root causes.. . To address your own concerns, the university definitely needs to weigh the feelings of people who feel more unsafe with higher police presence (I am one of those actually \*because of\* being a member of some of the vulnerable groups you mentioned), versus people who feel more safe with police protections such as yourself, which is also valid! Perhaps they could have discussed a watchdog/oversight committee for DPS/AAPD that could address specific concerns of GEO rather than actually defunding them. That would have come across as more pro-labor and maybe even more pro-student, and again, address the concerns more than the demands. I am sure there are other options too, which could have made for a very good discussion among admins, GEO representatives, and other stakeholders.. . As a final note, the idea that GEO is only allowed to strike over very specific concerns is one of the ideas that I think weakens labor strength generally. Certain graduate students felt unsafe and they used the only tool they saw available to them. A union exists to give a workforce strength, and that should extend beyond the existing confines of a contract. That's also why I support the RAs striking. They don't have any contract that permits strikes, but they just wanted to be heard, and I think they have a right.",7.0,error,0.0

However, I think the University has already stated that no one is teaching in person who desired to be online, which was backed up by a couple PHD/GSIs that I know. I think the main reason umich is being seen as anti labor right now is because they used the choice they had to, threatening legal action. There was no end in sight for the GEO strike, which has disrupted many classes undergrads are paying for, including instances where GSIs removed their entire course from canvas. If the GEO made more reasonable demands that fit into the description of their contract, then I believe the university may have been more inclined to listen to. However, when demands include a complete cut with AAPD and a 50% cut in DPS, these are demands that the university knows they can't meet. Therefore, they are left with two options: allow the GEO strike to continue, meaning undergrads will continue to miss out on education they've paid thousands for, or threaten legal action to resolve the issue.

College isn't necessarily some great philosophical endeavor, its a very big investment you make to further your career path and develop your skills. Personally, I think you can do well wherever you go, but Michigan tends to be very well regarded among most people for its rigor and it has a lot of great resources you can take advantage of (as do many places). As an undergrad, I've found that university administration tends not to affect me that much, certainly much less than the policies of individual professors and course coordinators. That said, I've lived off campus since sophomore year so I've avoided having to deal with the covid response in the dorms, which is apparently pretty annoying, although hopefully we won't have to work around a pandemic again (and if it did happen during your time in college there would very likely be a more informed response).. . It's a massive school, and while there is some cultural aspects that you can extend to most students, there isn't one type of student and its effortless to completely avoid people you don't agree with. And that poc cafe thing happened at the dearborn campus, which while affiliated with Umich, is not the same thing as Umich AA, it is effectively a different college entirely (and that ordeal stinks no matter how deep you look into it).. . I think a lot of people on this sub tend to be very vocal about things that upset them, which isn't wrong by any stretch but it also makes pessimistic views more visible. But don't get the wrong idea, there's 40000 students at this university, you can have a big network of friends and go about your day without being involved with activism whatsoever if that's what you want, and if you are the type to engage is such activities then there's usually stuff going on as well, the university is the size of a medium sized town.. . Basically, for the concerns you've listed I'd say you should still consider Umich. Instead consider the academics, the potential competition, cost, offers you get from other schools, the culture, what you want to get out of college, the statistics for what you want to study, and experiences from current students also in that discipline.",1.0,neutral,0.6709451079368591

State governments responding not based off of data based off of whether trump approved or not is also one of the main reasons that we have had massive spread in many parts of this country, and massive economic damage that was not necessary in others.. . How many people prematurely died as a result of not being able to get treatments for other diseases because everything was focused on Coronavirus? . . How many people committed or attempted to commit suicide as a result of the lockdowns preventing basic human interaction necessary to keep us from going insane?. . How much economic damage will lead to more people dying of other causes, or inhibiting our ability to fight Coronavirus in the 1st place by depleting our economic resources?. . These are all questions I want to be answered, these are all the genuine questions that need to be taken into account when we are making decisions. But I guarantee the people in this video have not thought for 1 second about the fact that people can disagree with their proposal and not be deniers of Coronavirus.. . It's real easy to get on your high horse and accuse people who think that endless lockdowns and tele-working will solve everything, one that is a really privileged position to be living in, without taking to account the hundreds of thousands of other things that will suffer as a result. . .

The purpose of some of the original lockdowns was about buying time to get testing kits out as fast as possible, it is totally unreasonable to pretend that we could have gone in a full lock down that you are proposing. We're gonna be living with this virus in a state similar to this for the next couple of years, it is totally unreasonable to pretend that we can stay shut down until there's no more cases. All we have to do is decide what risks are good and what risks are not. Wearing a mask help slow the spread and allows us to do many of the things we normally would do in a safer manner, therefore that as a thing that we should be doing.. . 2. The structure of government the United States does not allow the federal government to mandate shutdowns. (Also, do you really want Trump telling you what you are allowed to do, be careful what you wish for.) The job as president of the United States during a pandemic is to be chief communicator and organizing continual talks amongst governors of each state. President Trump abdicated his responsibilities here, and many republicans of also abdicated their responsibilities to make Trump look good. There are also many democrats, such as Governor Cuomo of New York, such as Governor Whitmer of Michigan, and other governors who mandated Coronavirus patients be sent to nursing homes, which lead to massive spikes in deatbs, but I don't see people banging the war drum over that heinous dereliction of duty.. . . >Yeah, I'm terrified at the thought of so many Trumpsters and AnCap idiots like you getting to decide who makes the decisions in Government.. . I'm neither one of those things but thanks for the arrogance and missing the point.. . >""But duh economy. Muh suicides. Muh lockdown"". . If an economy crashes that can lead to mass starvation and poverty, which is significantly worse than a pandemic. But even under the case where there isn't a massive crash but they're still a of large drop in wealth, that still hurts our ability to solve the problems caused by the pandemic in the first place. . . But way to just pretend that concerns about economic turmoil are just deflections, and not being concerned about how they affect the transmission rate and other issues in society that matter.",3.0,error,0.0

It's quite useful in preventing google from associating with your Amazon searches or other things individual megacorps have no control over (although that's very few things). In case of mail tho, Google scans every message in your inbox by default and also generates its ad tokens by IP or IP group. Basically if you keep logging in from the same network in the same area they'll keep getting positive hits on you. The way to prevent that would be to use a VPN 24/7 and keep changing the server you connect to. But I'm pretty sure google does other stuff too, for example if your computer has its DNS server set to one of theirs, unless your VPN replaces the default DNS server for DNS queries, they will keep getting hits on you because every time you open a url they will get a request from your computer and associate you with your token.. . I think that when it comes to privacy, you have to consider the trade offs. Your school activity and work are already not your own - depending on the case they partially or completely belong to the university. There really isn't much value in going through a lot of hoops to safeguard this data either - who cares about your homework or study plan? If you are paranoid about the details of your schedule leaking out to somebody who you expect will use them against you, you may have larger problems to worry about. . . Using a VPN with school stuff is annoying and not very useful, however I do think that using one for whenever you're doing anything in your free time is a good practice together with the containers and blocking devices. But again - there's just levels of safety and it's never perfect. It's practically impossible to stay fully anonymous and maintain privacy on the modern internet - even TOR is compromised and its highly likely that most encryption algorithms we use have back doors we are not aware of given the history of such algorithms. The only truly safe device is one that is disconnected from the network and has no means of accessing one.",5.0,neutral,0.7576849460601807

At least with BME there will be some overlap, but ChE and premed sounds like absolute hell because you've got to take all the engineering core requirements, all the LSA requirements including language, distributions, etc with all of the transport and physics based process classes. Mixing these two will kill your GPA and ruin the chance of medschool before you even graduate with your bachelor's. GPA aside, you will be either ridiculously busy or you will have to span your undergrad out for a few semesters more than a typical engineering degree. This either equates to more money spent or less time to do internships, shadowing, and premed related work, which will again ruin your chances of getting into med school. . .

Hypercompetitive enviroments ironically can lower the quality of learning because people tend to become more result oriented (good grade) rather than focused on the process (proper learning).

Combined together, students may not have a good foundation - despite the 'rigor' of their program.. .

Some of that is due to simple old fogey-hood. Some of it is due to the fact that, in my field, you can't easily type notes due to the preponderance of figures, diagrams and equations. In any case, this means I transcribe those notes - typing them up - later than evening. This allows me to visit the content in multiple ways at multiple points in time. I hear the content from the lecturer (admittedly, this was pre-COVID), I write the content long-hand (which uses different mental pathways than typing) and then I type the content.. . I do this routinely on a schedule rather than just ""whenever I get around to it"". Likewise, I had specific blocks of time for study and I'd rarely 'study' in the sense of constantly going over my notes. Again, this can be discipline-specific, but most of my study would be doing various problem sets. This isn't much use for a Humanities major, but I've found that addressing the same material from different angles can accomplish the same thing. Reading not just the work, but commentaries on the work, watching film adaptations or engaging in a discussion about the work.. . Accountability is the other - harder - aspect.

In any case, it sounds like it wouldn't trip [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/), and if it did, any flagged similarities would probably be of the sort that an instructor would conclude to be incidental convergence rather than collaboration.. .

The only way I'd expect for you to get caught is if you were to announce publicly that you had done such a thing on a social media website like reddit that is also browsed by numerous EECS 280 course staff, which shouldn't be a major concern.. . tl;dr you're probably fine; and you arguably did the right thing from a Chaotic Good perspective, especially since it seems like you were making a good-faith effort to help them learn rather than giving them an opportunist's shortcut .. . though if you want to continue doing this, it may be wise to proactively set boundaries on how much you're willing to help / how much project code you'll review, since if (for instance) ""DM my friend and have them look over my code"" became a part of your friend's _workflow_ then you _definitely_ would be giving them a legitimately unfair advantage",8.0,neutral,0.6309645175933838

In magazine and book publishing, this is usually considered an essential task; sometimes it falls on the shoulders of a copy editor, but often it is the job of a separate fact checker. My experience, however, is in daily newspapers, where deadline constraints usually dictate that the writer must be trusted to get the facts right in the first place.

So there just might be more actually going in for testing. . . Also, I noticed they haven't changed the dorm numbers with the increased numbers from off campus, but I know at least one person who got tested off campus because UoM was taking too long, came in positive and moved to quarantine this week.

I also criticized it for failing to ""proactively fact check"" things like GEO supporters' account of the Aura Rosser shooting.
