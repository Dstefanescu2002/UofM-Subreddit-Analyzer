The astro department is cool, and people I know have had fairly positive experiences with it, but the many, many large physics and math lectures put me off. There were so many prerequisites that I never got very deep into the major. I never felt a sense of belonging. The major I was dreaming of for years was not going to become a reality, which was hard for me to overcome. When I finally switched majors I found my place at the university. The department was great, I had professors that actually cared about me, the class sizes were much smaller. It was so much better. I can't speak on what Astro is like when you get into higher level work, but I know the entry level stuff is partially challenging. . . To actually get to your question, I'm probably the least gung-ho person to ask about Michigan. I think the school is amazing school with fantastic resources. There is really no better place to go if you want to research (that is if you can get in with anyone in the astro department...). That said, umich is also overrated and extremely over priced. I only went to umich because I was in state, and within commuting distance. I also transferred, there was no way I was going to pay for all four years at Michigan. . . If I was an oos student, there would be no chance that I would go to umich. The way I see it, in just about every single case, I would never recommend taking out around a quarter of a million dollars in loans just to go to undergrad.

Another alternative would be to make very clear to him you disagree, and your disagreement is so fundamental you have no interest in hearing more or discussing it with him. And you can decide whether this means you do not want any contact from him, or if you continue contact as long as any remarks like this are completely off the table. If you do this, I recommend you give yourself a little refresher course on assertiveness, because this guy seems like he really wants to talk about it, and you absolutely have to hold fast to not engaging. Some of these folks are gifted manipulators, and they will go you into engaging with them, that's why reviewing some of the principles of being assertive can really help.. .

In this case I would arm myself with some of the best counter arguments out there.

I took a disliking to them just because they spraypainted advertising graffiti around town looking for tenants prior to opening, including on campus.

I'm currently registered for Chem 125/126/130, Eng 100 (Sec 980), and Eng 151 (13 credits). . I just finished the audition process and didn't make the drumline which would have 2 more credits for 15 total (which would have been good to take it a little easier first sem). . . Anyway, for context, I have 40 credits going in (Covering Calc 1-4, both physics, and some elective/breadth) and so I'm hoping to be able to do the SUGS program in 4 years (BSE+MSE).. . Given that I now only have 13 credits in my schedule, I'd like to take another class and was looking at Linear Algebra (or maybe discrete math). It looks like pretty much all of the sections of math 217 are full/waitlist so I was wondering if I should look to take one of the other Lin Alg classes (214, 417, or 419) . . I was wondering if people had any thoughts are far as which I should look towards. At the moment I'm planning on majoring in CS or Data but I've always loved theory so I'm not against taking a more theoretical class. . . . I know 214/417 are the more applied classes but I've been unable to figure out what the difference between the 200 and 400-level classes are (other than credits).. . . . I would appreciate any input regarding which class I should take (and/or if I should get on a waitlist for 217) or if I'm better off taking discrete math or a different class entirely. . . .

I'm a grad student from Southern United States, which is pretty warm and has four-ish distinct seasons. It gets cold where I'm originally from, but it doesn't typically drop below 30 degrees on average. Anyway, I appreciated when people would provide detailed responses about the weather, so I'll do the same here:. . I first arrived in late August, and the weather was hot (mid-high 80s beginning around noon and the low was typically around high 50s). I typically wore shorts and short sleeves. When I had school related events, I wore long pants, but stayed in short sleeve shorts. . . The weather continued to stay warm until late September. Late September is when more traditional Fall weather appeared. There were some nice breezes, but it wasn't chilly just yet. In other words, there was no need for anything but a light jacket (if anything). This was by far my favorite time of the year! I walked to class everyday and would sit on patios to get work done. . . Mid October is when things started to shift. The weather began to drop to the point where you needed a coat. You don't need a hefty winter coat just yet, but you need a solid coat to brace yourself from some consistent wind chills throughout the day and cold nights (probably mid 40s in the peak of the day and 30s starting in the late afternoon). . . By November (especially by Thanksgiving), prepare for THE COLD!!! It will start snowing a bit and you will NEED some serious winter gear (sweaters, boots, hats, gloves, ear muffs, and a REAL WINTER COAT). Don't be like me and think you can just wear anything to cover up and be ok. The cold passed straight through my little cheap gear. Lol I would invest in some serious winter paraphernalia particularly since you'll be walking on campus throughout the day (if you don't already have it). My current winter clothing was no match for the Michigan weather.. . December through March is when seasonal depression hits. The snow consistently falls and won't let up. The slush from the snow makes walking through the campus a nightmare, so get some solid boots and socks! This is when the temps will be in the single digits. Even if the sun is out, it won't make a difference. Lol. Others may say I'm being dramatic, but remember, I'm from a place that's not as cold. So my first winter here shocked me. . . I seriously thought April and May would bring warmer weather, but don't bet on that. While it didn't snow as often, it was STILL COLD. To put it in perspective, for Cinco de Mayo, my friends and I had on full coats and sweaters this year. It didn't start breaking into warmer weather again until late May/June. . . All in all, welcome to Michigan! I hope you enjoy it. If you come here and have your winter clothes shipped in by September, you'll be perfectly fine! If you're coming from a place that doesn't get extremely cold, consider adding some new gear to your collection once you arrive.",2.0,error,0.0

If you can't maintain a good gpa, then don't challenge yourself beyond the required courses. . . Ross really cares about character and interest in business more than anything. One of the reason Ross is so selective is because a lot of students would choose business as a back-up, or perhaps bc they couldn't find anything else to do, but Ross doesn't want those students. They want the students that are actually passionate about business. Making sure your essays, extracurriculars, and coursework reflect that would make you a stronger applicant imo. .

t1_ifv4gjf,2022-07-12 14:59:09,t3_vx3eyh,t3_vx3eyh,"So there are 4 main research channels that I know.. . 1. Cold email i.e. look at a department website look at the faculty. see what research they do, email and see if they have projects. This is often volunteer work for a year, and often (but not always) undergrads start getting paid after their 2nd year, provided they show significant progress (Few will pay you if you work 1 hr a week) . 2. Urop programs - you do an application and university will try to match you with a prof that matches skills and interest. Projects are often for the entire school year. I think Urop is paid. more info can be found [here](https://lsa.umich.edu/urop). 3. Srop the summer version of Urop. Info [here](https://rackham.umich.edu/rackham-life/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/srop/). 4. 4. Reu. Like Srop, except at other schools. Reu has added advantage from srop since there is a larger pool of labs, but also semi more competitive [info here](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) . . You can talk to profs instead of cold email as well, or email one of your past profs if they know someone who does work in an area you are interested in. . . . The first thing you should do is take a look at the research area and be honest if you are interested. As a grad student, a lot of UG fake interest get in the lab and then drop out in less than a month. While it's understandable that things change and the work may not be what you envision, keep in mind most of the time UG's are being trained by grad students, and often the UG works on a piece of the Grad student's project. So the lack of consistency, plus training is a large expense on the grad student's time. be mindful.. . . . 2nd thing you should do is read the papers. Don't expect to understand the work entirely. Papers are dense and even experts have trouble reading them some times. The point of reading the paper is to give you a better idea of what the lab does. And it gives you things to talk about and hopefully sparks question. . . . To the email. You should introduce yourself and write your basic stats. You should mention you're interested in research, and why. At this point referencing a paper could be useful. I see your lab works on XXXX, I would like to work in this lab because I want to explore this when I go into industry. Your lab uses YYYY approach, which is something I want to improve on... I'm curious about research because I want to be a grad student for ZZZZ reason. This shows the prof you have educated yourself on the topic, and you can do research to some degree. A lot of undergrads I interview have no idea why they are there. While ""this looks fun"" is a great answer, keep in mind, research mentor is a two way street. You're gaining skills, knowledge etc.. the lab wants a UG that will stick around. . . Then you should include key skills to why you think you're a good fit. This doesn't have to be technical perse. Could be you have experience in the language already, could be you have a lot of time to work on the project. You need to show the prof that you have made steps to expand your skill sets or made provisions to build for new ones. This is not to say if you don't have knowledge of a skill, you're not getting in. If you have all the skills you wouldn't be looking for the research OP. What I am saying is learning takes time and you want to make sure you have that time to learn. . . . Finally ask them if they have time to discuss any open projects they may have and remember to send your resume. At this point, the prof will look at your stuff and if they have something for you will talk to you or send you to the grad student. . . . . Don't worry if you don't hear back. Profs are busy. If you don't hear in 2-3 weeks, send a reminder email.. . . . Keep in mind grad students have autonomy, you can direct email a grad student if you go to their lab website and see a project that interests you.",21.0,error,0.0

While Profs don't expect you to know everything, there is a general expectation you know some of the more common concepts and theory in lab at a high level. . . you have mentioned cs. in my limited pov, i would understand a prof would want a student who knows cs at some degree. how to create data structures, discrete structures etc... it would help with direct experience in the language they have but not necessary. . . As a freshman it is fully possible you have learned these concepts in high school, but the understanding is different. I've taught basic science classes at the ug, high-school and middle school levels. albeit same concepts, the understanding based on level is different. you may not have the training you need yet. no worries, you are still early into your career. it will happen.. . >what are some ways you would recommend a freshman to get research experience and mentorship?. . I'll answer the mentorship question first. Talking to everyone. Your peers, your professors and especially online. from an industry perspective, professors are usually well connected. being friendly with professors can get you opportunities. peers can as well but they don't interact with industry at the same level generally. I would say look for different types of mentors. the human experience is vast, but not so vast people can't cross over and give perspectives. some of my best mentors have been outside of my chosen field. for example, I have a lot of mentors in smtd. and their perspectives on risk and performance really helps me when i want to think about next steps and future directions. don't be afraid to be ask. either. professors love mentorship. and many will say yes if yoi demonstrate you have thought about what kind of mentorship you want from them.. . to the research experience question. projects. recreate projects you find online and improve upon them. this shows that you understand what the project is asking by recreating it and improving shows you have a deeper level of comprehension as well as gives you talking points. when i interview students for lab, i ask them conceptual questions like this. I give them a chart, a graph, or something similar. a piece of data is wrong. i then ask, ask for sources of error and then what would they do get better data. there is no right answer but it gives me a sense how they understand the science. . . >what are some other things that would help be get internships early on?. . do projects, outside of classes. this can be done on your own or by joining clubs. you need to show you have skills outside school. commonly juniors and seniors get internships at higher rates because they have a) more classes and thus knowledge and b) more time to develop those skills via projects. . . as a less advanced student, your formal training may be at a disadvantage, but your projects can compensate for this. . . >Does research experience in relate fields work. . In my experience , it helps. you have direct experience so your employer teaches you faster (low learning curve) and you can talk about things more knowledgeably.. . However! keep in mind you're sometimes evaluated differently. I was contacted by a hiring manager a few weeks ago for an interview. they wanted me to explain a technique i use in my lab. i hadn't done it since pre covid so my knowledge was rusty. my explaination was very basic, which worked against me since I worked on it for so long. . . . closing statements: i don't know you, nor your reasons for wanting to pursue an internship so quickly, however i will say, eyes on your prey, not the horizon. you will deal with a lot of challenges in your freshman year, many of them brand new. focus on them, adjusting to college life, learning your craft and have a solid foundation. if you too far ahead you may miss what you need now. . . . good luck and i hope you enjoy your time here",7.0,error,0.0

First of all, ECON 451 is ECON department's version of probability and statistics, from what I have heard and conjecture it is the equivalent of STATS 412. In the statistics and economics departments, the sequence of MATH 425 and 426 can be used to fulfill the STATS 250/280/412 and ECON 451 requirements if taken early while the other way around is not possible. ECON 451 is more closer to STATS 412, a more rigorous version of intro statistics and probability, than theoretical statistics, STATS 426. . Second, 425 and 525 overlap in material while 525 is much more in depth and more theoretical (Focus on generating and characteristic functions instead of named distributions). 525 can be used in place of 425 but the other way around is rare.. . Third 426 and 526 are nothing alike. 526 is discrete state stochastic processes, focusing on Markov Chains (Discrete and Continuous time) while 426 is theoretical statistics, focusing on proving and deriving properties of common statistical tools (distributions of tests, hypothesis testing, estimators, etc). As such the 425-426 and 525-526 sequences are not that comparable. . . As with the rest of the MATH department how the course is taught depends on the instructor (which changes every semester) which would influence how much you need the prerequisites.

In a lot of countries, including where I'm from, there's this idea that you study hard and get good grades so that you can say ""oh I studied at MIT, Harvard, etc.."" And this isn't without reason; in a lot of countries, if you hear that someone went to a highly ranked school, they'll garner immediate respect and admiration.. . This is much less prevalent in the US. Yes, if you went to Harvard, you'll have a foot in the door that someone at a state university might not have. But if the state university student has the achievements to back their knowledge up in forms of projects and experience, they will get the job.. . On top of that, you're going into CS. Computer Science in the US is highly meritocratic outside of finance; companies mostly don't put much emphasis on where you went for school. If you practice programming assessment questions and create your own projects, you'll have a very good chance at getting a good job as long as you have a degree from somewhere.. . That being said, you should consider whether a Michigan is a good fit for you, especially since that's the question admissions offices try to answer. Michigan CS is in general a lot more rigorous than Community College CS. If you're currently having trouble, I really believe that Michigan CS would only amplify that. Instead, focus on your algorithmic skills and work hard to get past interviews. That's more valuable than any university you could go to. These supposed ""elite students"" can shove their bullshittery where the sun don't shine, especially if you get a job that you're happy at through working hard while they have a life that revolves around some lie-filled essay that got them into a prestigious university.. .

This is because the virus is not terribly contagious and spreads most often via prolonged skin-to-skin contact and via sharing things like towels and bed linens that touch a lot of skin and get reused before washing. This mean that it will strongly tend to be transmitted within networks marked by prolonged bodily contact with one another. Sex, therefore, is an easy way to transmit it, and this applies to any kind of sex where you're touching one another a lot: even if nobody finishes, the skin-to-skin contact will transmit the virus. Since gay men tend to have sex with other gay men and only rarely have prolonged skin-to-skin contact with people who aren't gay men, that transmission network has stayed relatively closed.. . College campus dynamics can change this in a few ways, but luckily they're all very avoidable. The main thing is not to put yourself in a situation where you're bumped up against strangers with no or very little clothing. Skeeps and Ricks are probably a bad idea. Necto is probably a bad idea. Frat parties probably also bad ideas. Football games are a lot less risky, especially as the weather cools down and everyone is in layers. Probably don't wanna pile into a big cuddle pile on your friend's couch either, but giving another clothed person a hug is fine.. . I say all this because what's most important right now is to get health resources to the community most affected: that means educating and vaccinating gay men. Doing that will protect everyone else as well, since stopping infections in the most-affected group will dramatically lower risk for everyone. It's important not to panic, because a widespread panic could result in resources being diverted away from where they're most effective and toward more vocal and influential but less objectively at-risk groups.",4.0,neutral,0.7109018564224243

I did UROP my sophomore year and really enjoyed it, it was a good stepping stone for when I sought out more research experience after and now I'm in a clinical psych lab that I love! My urop experience was during covid though so it was remote and I honestly did not get to do much but it depends on the project you get. . 3.

This can be an easy access community to get pointed in the right direction. Yes I know that you can search stuff out online, but it isn't always obvious where to go. . * I am not a current student and begrudgingly feel that while annoying to me, the most active demographic of our community is current students and so we should meet the needs of that group. Not all posts on the subreddit need to be by/for current students but the type of post you are describing usually gets decent input. . * There is an increased amount of self-policing by commenters. Similar to many admissions topics a lot of times now the top comment will just be 'You need to talk to an advisor'. People are willing to share their experience but recognize that it's just their experience. . . I will also say that there's an important difference between posts seeking advice and experience from other students vs. posts wanting to know if class X counts for requirement Y.

Generally, it is true that umich takes their own at higher rates, but for the phd level its not wildly noticeable. my cohort of 30 had 3 people who came here from undergrad.. . Your advisor is correct, gsi positions preferentially go to phd students, then masters then ugs, and while it is possible to leave mid phd with a masters I would be very hesistant to do it. . . One as you mentioned, it's significantly more difficult to enter grad school as a phd student. You genereeally need higher gpa, gre scores (some programs still use it) and some type of prior research experience. Additionallly, profs filter out who they want to work for them. Not sure what your acting skills are, but some profs can tell who is in their lab for the wrong reasons. . . The second is some programs are trying to discourage this, by not making a masters possible. So it's BA/BS straight to phd.. . Psychologically, it's going to be less likely you drop out of phd the longer you are in it. A phd is unlike UG, with very long hours, challenging workloads, and often variable schedule. The sacrifices often lead to a sunken cost fallacy, and so the rates of attrition is highest in the first year and drops significantly each year afterwards. I consider dropping out of grad school everyday, but never do because I feel I'm too far along. . . Finally, not sure what your field is, but I would recommend do grad school only if you need it. You sound like you are in your early 20s and as someone who started phd in their early 20s, there is a heavy life opportunity cost to grad school as well. There will be a lot of changes in your life from during your 20s and grad school will impact that growth a lot. Also, master degrees don't hold their weight like they used to depending on your field.. . . . Idk what your goals are, but if you need a masters degree, I would recommend a 4+1 program if it's available to you. It might be more money in the front end, but there will be surprise costs you'll pay instead if you pursue a phd and then drop out a few years later.",21.0,neutral,0.7873045802116394

If you want to learn C++ for a very specific reason (e.g. you want to write embedded software or something), definitely go for it. If you're coming in as a new programmer with no previous computer science or programming experience, learn a dynamically typed, memory managed interpreted language.. . In layman's terms, learn Python. I haven't taken the ""Python for everybody"" course others have mentioned, but generally speaking, if you're interested in programming and you get free access to Coursera programming courses from a major university highly ranked for CS education and research, I highly, highly recommend taking them. Especially if they're from UM which is clearly the best university in the world ;). . There's also a [Python specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming#courses), which goes into more detail than ""Python for Everybody,"" so you can choose how much you want to learn here. If you're not sure, I'd go with ""Python for Everybody,"" see if you like the content, and if you do, take the specialization.. . In case you were wondering, I'll explain why C++ is not a great choice for your first language. C++ - and its predecessor and subset, C - are languages commonly referred to as ""low level"". Although it might sound like they're lesser somehow, this just means that they expose more of the ""inner-workings"" of the computer.. . That means they abstract fewer of the inner-workings of the computer away from you. In other words, C++ handles fewer of the ""nitty-gritty"" details of building software, which tend to be advanced and complex, meaning your learning curve is going to be (much) steeper because you're going to have to learn and master a lot of tricky concepts before you can make progress.. . Also, C++ is a notoriously complex language. That's for a few reasons I won't get into here, but the result is that it's hard even for experienced programmers to really grasp how to build complex (AKA real-life commercial) software.. . I don't mean to scare you off from C++, I just want to really encourage you to learn Python first. Or if not Python, another language that fits the criteria I gave in the first paragraph. I do believe that you should eventually learn C++ if you want to get exposed to more and more CS ""stuff"". I highly recommend it as a second or third language, and I'm happy to share those if someone wants, but for now I'll just leave it at that.. . Source: I graduated in 2008 with an undergraduate degree in CSE, the first language I significantly learned was C++ in EECS 280 (and then 281 and then the rest of the CSE curriculum). While I do think that C and C++ were probably the two best options at the time (although even that is debatable), so many languages (including Python) have arisen since then that will make the learning experience much better.",0.0,error,0.0

If you don't like it, you can drop one of them within the drop-add deadline (usually about 3-4 weeks) with 0 consequences. By contrast, it's not as easy to start with only 1 of those 2 classes and later decide you want to be in both. Plus taking 280+203 lets you take 281 a semester early, which has its advantages (e.g. earlier access to upper level CS classes). . I think whether I'd recommend 280 or 203 depends on the person. 280 is more or less straight-up programming. It assumes some familiarity with C++ (see next paragraph, if you did alright in AP CSA then you can probably pick it up pretty fast). By contrast 203 is a math class, not a programming class (and probably not like any math class you had in high school, you can take a peek [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) if you want a rough idea of the content). All that said, I think most people I know have more mixed feelings about 203 than 280, so since you have prior programming experience, I would probably recommend 280 over 203 if you only want to take one.. . At the level of prerequisite knowledge needed for 280, C++ isn't that different from Java. Personally, the summer before my freshman year, I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y) and checked out [this OCW course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/) up to the lesson on pointers.

Furthermore, the Ann Arbor drinking water treatment plant uses a variety of treatment processes that can remove hexachromium (chemical softening, filtering). . . I'm not arguing this isn't a problem. If the hexachromium sticks to the sediment it could mean the Huron becomes dangerous to recreate in for a long time.

Back then during my time with registering classes, I made the mistake of expecting to get a 4 on that exam which could lead me to getting credit for Math 115 and focused on putting Calculus 2 in a part of my schedule. . . I informed my advisor and she told me to do this waitlist form for Math 115. I chose 3 options of which times the Math 115 be suitable for my schedule and location of traveling for other classes that can be perceived to be far away. 2 of the choices were to start around I think 8:00 or 8:30 A.M. with both being on MonWedFri while 1 choice, the one I prefer, starts at 11:30 A.M for MonTueThur. Obviously I didn't want to choose the 8:00 times to be a part on the waitlist due to the warnings of how it would be a struggle to wake up that early and prepare for class, but they were the only options, along with the 11:30, that would fit my schedule. . . I'm not expecting to get the 11:30 class(although hope I do) but I at least hope that I can get one of the 8:30 classes. But I'm worried that I won't get off the waitlist for the Math 115 classes and that I wouldn't be able to take it. Which is sort of stressing me out as that class is a requirement for my engineering major. My advisor told me that if the waitlist doesn't work out, I could still do Math 115 in the winter semester and just do Engineering 100 in the fall semester(I'm doing Rob 102 which counts as credit for Engr 101 instead of doing Engr 100 for the fall semester) But I was hoping I could Math 115 for the Fall Semester and do Math 116 for the Winter Semester so it would make things easier for me to getting the required credits in doing my major while also making things on track for graduation. I guess my question is there any hope in getting off of the waitlist for Math 115 and being able to take that class in the Fall Semester? Or would I have to do the second option that my advisor said just in case, which I'm hoping doesn't happen?

t1_ijc8rg6,2022-08-07 18:16:57,t3_wi4hla,t3_wi4hla,"Here's some perspective. I was a 2019 grad from umich.. . I started out as a math major and got up to the 400 level courses, then flunked one of those courses. It wasn't totally unexpected: I was seeing a steady downward progression of my letter grades in my math courses through my first couple of years at umich. The higher the course level went up, the lower my grade became, but I kept at it. That is, until I flunked that last course really badly. Like, worst-score-on-the-final-exam-in-the-whole-class badly. . . The good news is that today, I actually look back at this time in my life as a really pivotal and important moment. The bad news is that at the time, I felt like a major part of my identity up to that point in my life as a ""smart, capable student"" was just proven to be incorrect. At the risk of sounding like an annoying, know-it-all high school classmate, I was not used to failure like that and I was not prepared to accept it. But there it was, right on my transcript in black and white. That was the winter semester of my sophomore year, so I had already dedicated two years/half of my college years to studying math and had already declared my major, too. It felt impossible to quit after dedicating all that time and effort to the program, but I knew at that point, that I was going to need to do exactly that. I think on some level I knew it wasn't the program for me for a while (interest-wise and aptitude-wise), but I also think I needed to fail the class to actually go forward with switching my major.. . I took that summer to think carefully about what I wanted to do instead, and after applying to Ross on a whim and getting rejected (lol, that was for the best, too. Business wouldn't have been for me), I decided to study Communications. I graduated with around a 3.4 or 3.5, I don't really remember (a good reminder that GPA feels life-defining in college but truly fades from your memory within a few years of graduating). I was able to get to the 3.4/3.5 range with both the failed class and a few other B-'s/C's in there, too (of course, there were A's too, but my point is that it wasn't like I was perfect other than the failed course). I also had a couple of good jobs/internships during school to help demonstrate that I was learning/gaining experience outside of getting those things just from my classes. . . In the spring of 2019, ahead of graduation, I got a job offer at a large tech company (granted, not a STEM-related role, but still a job at a tech company) and am still with that same company today. I also was promoted to a management role within my first year there and have since almost doubled my salary. . . Relatedly, I also have a friend who failed an EECS course, retook it, and passed. Today, he's a software developer at large, reputable company. I share this because though failing a class and switching out of my program was what was right for me, you can definitely keep trying on your same tract and be successful in that field long-term.. . Tl;dr: failing a class sucks, and it can make you feel like crap about yourself. However, it DOES NOT mean you aren't smart or capable. It won't destroy your GPA on its own: you can recover from it if you do mostly well in the rest of your courses. Remember, too, that you are at one of the best public universities in the world. Just being a student there is an incredible accomplishment :)",3.0,error,0.0
