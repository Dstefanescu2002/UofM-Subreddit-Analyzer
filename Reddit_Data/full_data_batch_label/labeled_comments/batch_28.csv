This story very likely took place in [redacted]. (Or maybe the suite style part of [redacted].) In the relatively unlikely event that your student is offered a contract in one of those room types, they could decline it and live off campus. . . To be clear, I'm not victim blaming here. Every room should be safe and secure. (Beyond the ethics of it all, if the university is truly just being greedy, that seems like a giant liability issue.) And no freshman should need to live off campus if they didn't plan to.. . --. . When I was on campus, RAs were trained to be very aware of the services offered by the [SAPAC](https://sapac.umich.edu/) center, the office of the ombuds, and the Dean of Students office - both for our residents and ourselves. I'm surprised that a negligently awful Hall Director and Housing Security Officer were the end of the road for a set of very legitimate safety complaints. Again, not saying it should be the survivor's responsibility to seek out other avenues - but my RA peers probably would have had someone supportive from SAPAC along for the process of mandatory reporting. . . The university also did not allow sophomores to be RAs - you had to be a junior or above. It sounds like the restructuring and training changes that happened after I left decreased staff safety. . .

I was informed that it was my fault for being bullied, and they were unwilling to take action as it could be seen as racist.

Just to share some perspective as an alum: I used to work for ResStaff back in 2014-2016 and was fired due to something very unfair. My gut feeling was always that I was being targeted because I had been recommended by multiple coworkers over time and was eventually hired to be a DPE (diversity peer educator) the next year and i knew housing wasn't the best at anti-racist action and even shut down and fired those of us who spoke up. But what was especially awful was dealing with the process of being fired and then appealing- at various points, I was constantly gaslit and told absolute lies by people in Residence Education/Housing. I was also sexually harassed which to this day still triggers me to think about. It was also awful because I had no time to find new housing for the next school year.. . During this process I learned about MULTIPLE others who had been unfairly fired. For things like being too outspoken about racism, ""stealing"" and leaving things unlocked at the CC (with no proof), complaining about being harassed, etc. I also heard stories about RAs who were sexually assaulted and harassed by residents and other RAs.

If you're looking for research in the fall start cold emailing professors in may or in the summer, when they're a little more free. Their inboxes are probably full of emails from their students right now.. . 2. Be flexible with the professor, like most research you get to do is just whatever is on the professor's mind at the time so it's unlikely you'll get to do research on a topic you like anyway . . 3. Look into their lab websites and email senior members of the lab instead of the professor, that might work.. . 4. If they get back to you, read their papers and have an understanding of the type of work that they do so that you can impress them if they choose to interview you or otherwise take you on.. . Oh and 5. Ask the professors that you're taking classes with if they have any open research opportunities. This is usually the best way to go about it and it's how I got mine (though I know some of my lab mates got into it thru email, so ymmv).",3.0,neutral,0.5378752946853638

Most days I feel like a dumbass surrounded by a bunch of Einsteins, but that is kinda a good thing because its not really a good thing to be the smartest person in the room as we learn from others a lot. . . From my own experience, taking some time to decompress and walk outside in the snow/nature really helped me get through some tough shit. Don't make the same mistakes I did with turning to weed/drugs to try and compensate for mental health problems. If you have a therapist or a psychiatrist, try turning to them for advice as medication for depression may make a world of difference for you when you find the right medication. . . I've been nearly failing all of my classes, recovering from major health issues, and was still able to work with the majority of my professors to see what could be done so that I can catch up. The sooner you reach out and let the teachers know what has been going on with your life lately, the better off you will be.. . For what it's worth, I'm happy that you are a student at umich and I wish you the best with whatever you are doing at school! School sucks and its been hard for me to get through, but you just have to find out what works best for your mental health and you can recover. . . You may have lost the battle by failing the midterm, but you certainly have not lost the war. Even if it's not possible to pass the class, you can always take it again in the future.

But that also means this is not like HS, where you could count on being the smartest person in the room in every class. Here, everyone is smart like you and the instructors count on that when creating course content, assignments and exams.. . Because you and all the rest of the students at Michigan are so smart, there are basically only a few ways any of them ever do poorly at Michigan. The #1 reason is they have too much on their plate and they simply don't have time to get all the work done. The result is they don't do poorly in just one class, they do poorly in all of them because they're spread too thin to do well in any of them. If that's your problem, the fix is pretty straightforward: reduce your courseload. Twelve units is all it takes to be full-time and 12 units of A's beats 16 with a bunch of B's and C's any day of the week. If you drop something now, it'll show up as a W on your transcript but a W is better than failing, especially if it lets you pull up your grades in your remaining classes.. . A distant second is they don't like what they're doing. For example, some students are attracted to CS because they think it will lead to a guaranteed $100K job at the end. But they hate it. If that's you, you need to find something else that you do like. No one can (or should!) spend their whole life in job they hate. As Steve Jobs counseled in his [Stanford commencement address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd_ptbiPoXM&t=59s), to do great work, you must love what you do and if you haven't found it, keep looking. Don't settle.. . On occasion, there are other reasons, usually family or medical problems. For example, if you're clinically depressed or suspect you may have undiagnosed ADHD, you should seek medical help.. . Good luck. I hope this helps.

They're simply not allowed to retaliate. So, if you take your complaint to department or college leadership, it will almost certainly be taken seriously and they will examine the evidence. For example, if your complaint concerns behavior in a lecture that's recorded, they will watch the video to see if they agree. They will also talk to the instructor to get their side of it and they may interview others.. . But even if they can't (and won't!) retaliate, you should take care to be sure your complaint is serious enough to be worth reporting. You don't want to be caught crying wolf about minor stuff, e.g., that your instructor occasionally swears and you're offended. (You're considered to be an adult who's heard these words before.) Similarly, complaining that the lectures are a waste of time will not get you anywhere. (Save all of that for your course eval.)

Yeah, but just looking back at my experience, Just wanna give you a different aspect of looking at the problem: failing an exam, or even failing a class can be not only your fault. You are working hard and it might be the problem of the course design or a mismatch with certain professors' styles. My first professor did not give me any support and was so strict and picky about my work - everything just became a vicious circle, I was less and less confident and interested in the content. However, I took my failed course again with another professor. He gave me so much encouragement and helped me get out of the depression, so I ended up with an A- in this same class. You know what, I performed well in most of the advanced classes later so actually I digested the knowledge quite well. Also, not to mention you have the choice of W so you could try to balance your schedule, focus more on your mental health for now, and take the class later. Now I would say, no one cares about my failure at that class - job seekers, grad committees, project advisors, etc. It is hard at the moment, so don't hesitate to seek help and there will always be someone on campus who can support you.

Wherever you go, I strongly suggest to keep looking for funding after your first year.. . $57k/yr is ungodly and if you need summer semesters or an extra year you're guaranteed to pay a quarter million--which IMO, a bachelors degree alone does not warrant no matter where you go. That being said, if the scholarships bring the cost down ""just not quite affordable,"" I wouldn't sweat a couple thousand dollars as there are tons of funding opportunities through research and major/college/org specific scholarships post-freshman year. You can sometimes save money also by studying abroad (hilarious ik; why is it so damn expensive here??). If you ask your major advisor and your academic advisor and meet with office of financial aid and actually read the many many many emails that you will receive from various departments and orgs, you can find a decent amount of financial support.. . I got at least an extra $10k worth of total support sophomore-senior year just through scholarship & grant programs specific to my colleges & majors (and am in state so had less need). Some of that could be considered wages since you have to do work (I.e. UROP/URPS) but others were outright grants (summer semester at UMBS fully funded, study abroad would have been fully funded through CGIS if not for pandemic, Graham scholars program paid for half a summer semester since I used it on a qualifying experience, RC gave a scholarship just for existing, etc...) No matter where you go to college, I strongly urge you to continue seeking out funding aggressively every year, because universities are quite literally sitting on mountains of money that they need to give away to students. Just gotta find the programs you qualify for.. . Good luck with your decision and congrats on your acceptance! I'm sure no matter where you go you'll find a path to success. To answer your actual question, in my experience students here were happy to help one another & always preferred to make a common enemy out of our workload than to compete with one another.

. or the Sun? Note the following:
. * The Sun is much more massive than the Moon, but also much further away. The

. * Msun = 27,000,000 X Mmoon
. * DEarth-Sun= 390 X DEarth-Moon
. * In-class exercise: How large is the solar equilibrium tide compared to the lunar
. equilibrium tide?
. * Approach: if Tidessun ~ Msun/(DEarth-Sun)3 and Tidesmoon ~ Mmoon/(DEarth-Moon)3
. , then you
. can try substituting in the mass of the moon into the mass of the sun and the
. distance from the moon to the distance from the sun. You should then be able to
. see which is bigger: Tidessun or Tidesmoon.
. If you make the suggested substitution, you should get that the tides from the sun are
. about 46% of those from the moon. We'll go over the math of these questions in class
. (so check the slides / class recording if you want to review that.) . . 12. Quantitative Question: Can the actual ocean tides equal the equilibrium tides?
. * Recall from the tsunami exercise that the phase speed of shallow water waves in
. a 4000 m ocean is about 200 m/s
. * What is the speed that waves would need to stay under the moon as it orbits
. around the Earth? (see following bullets)
. * If you're curious, we can compute this by relating Earth's rotational frequency to

Lastly, if you are in an environment that doesn't fit well with your personality, school will be twice as hard.

For the record, after multiple semesters with different students in my section, I had people come up to me saying how sorry they felt because of how the teachers berated me. Mayumi Oka, who is also head of the department, was the worst offender. There was one time where I forgot to do an assignment (this is the first time it ever happened) and she called my name to answer questions no less than 5 times during the class, and scolded me in front of other students every single time. There are too many other situations like this where I was humiliated in front of other students here, like when Mayumi Oka would clap in celebration when I got my name correct as a 4th semester student. . . The greatest feeling of catharsis that I had wasn't graduating, it was skipping her class for a random day in the semester.

Overall some observations:. . 1. Graduate courses are usually faster in pace than UG classes. This comes with the tradeoff that certain things that are explained slower/more in detail in UG classes but not in grad classes (Example: I took both graduate and undergraduate statistical learning since both were required. UG version went over certain parts of the algebra more in detail; however, the grad version glossed over the algebra. The grad course was able to cover almost 70% UG course by the midterm). 2. Graduate courses can emphasize fundamentals more (Example: took both grad and undergrad probability courses as they were required by the program. Both courses covered similar subjects but not only the grad course covered more; it went over the fundamentals, the probability space etc, further in depth while also covering more advanced material such as characteristic functions.). Proofs might be emphasized more in grad courses rather than computations.. 3. Depending on the course, grad courses might be more theoretical than applied. (This is dependent on the discipline so definitely ask around to determine if it is the case. For statistics department I heard 600s version of the courses were more theoretical while 500s are more applied, but do not have firsthand experience on this yet). 4. Grad courses definitely require more time and attention due to (1) and (2) described above. A good rule of thumb is looking at the maximal credit allowance for Rackham and LSA and taking its ratio (I think it is around 1.2, implying graduate courses of same credit require 1.2 times the time of UG courses).. . . . The real question is why do you want to take the grad version of the course than undergraduate version. If you want to eventually go on to graduate school, you might want to find out whether the course would be waived for you (I initially wanted to take grad micro/macro economics my senior year but was told if I got into a PhD program in the future, they would still require me to take it regardless so I didn't pursue it further, instead doing an accelerated masters on a different discipline) so you don't have to take the same course twice. Furthermore, doing well on graduate courses is always a good signal on your ability to eventually go on to graduate school or even PhD; however, skipping UG classes, taking a grad course, and doing poorly might hurt you more than it helps. It definitely depends on what you want to do and the discipline. I hope this helps and definitely reach out if you have more specific questions",1.0,error,0.0

No other class in this entire university gave me nearly as much anxiety as this one did. I genuinely wanted to learn and master this language at first, but it is incredibly easy to one day find yourself falling behind and becoming the whipping boy/girl/person.. . This class was everyday, for 1-2 hours a day, and everysingle day I walked to class, profusely sweating thinking about how badly I'd be publicly humiliated for that day. Side note: I'm pretty extroverted and love public speaking, so this was not anxiety from speaking in public - it was straight up public humiliation. And this is coming from someone who wasn't even the *worst* performing student in class. . . . It was honestly a miracle that I pass both 1st year semesters, and I've never worked so hard to pass a class in my entire life. At first, the class was incredible fun, social, and somewhat easy-ish, but eventually, I had to force myself to go into office hours 2-4 times a weeks, and attend group practice sessions **ON TOP** of all of the solo studying and additional homework that came along with it, on top of having classes every single day; just to pass. . . That type of pressure will never be conducive to a learning environment. It was a pressure I felt in class, while studying, or out of class, and it was so immense, that it made it hard to actually learn the class material. After that first year, I was told that I would need to retake first year if I wanted a realistic chance of passing; and that was when I never looked back. Everytime I think about, or try to speak the language nowadays, that experience is all I can think of. It was an absolute nightmare of an experience, and I do not recommend it to *anyone* unless all of your other classes are ""basket weaving"". Even then, I wouldn't recommend. If you're coming in with no knowledge of the language, prepare to dedicate all/most of your time to it, for 1-2 years, and say good to your social life and sleep while you're at it.. .

Admittedly this is more anecdotal experience than hard data. I've known a few SEAS Master's students and all were able to get GSI positions for at least a term. My guess is that SEAS has fewer PhD students (as a % of total students) than other programs and therefore more positions that can be opened up to Master's students.

Your experience in math 216 is similar to mine in math 215 and physics 240. I did poorly in those classes and was terrified that when I actually started the ""real"" upper level engineering classes that i wouldn't be able to keep up. But it wasn't the case in the end.. . In my experience, the pre-req courses are difficult because you have a barrage of difficult problem sets and exams that seem like they could cover more material than you have space in your brain for. You're in large lecture halls being taught by professors that don't want to be bothered with these low-level courses and not enouhh GSIs to meaningfully help the amount of struggling students they have to serve. . . . But for me, the 300- and 400-levels were difficult because they covered more complex topics in the first place, and the coursework was comparatively simpler. That's not to say it's easy, but the focus is more on communicating high-level ideas and not on drowning students in dozens of hours of derivations and proofs that they'll never remember after the semester. There are smaller classes, so the student to instructor ratio is more favorable, and the professors generally care more about these topics and aren't just in a rush to get the lecture over with. They can still be brutally difficult but in a way that feels more fair and accessible than 200-level math courses ever did.. . I fared far better in the upper-level courses compared to the pre-req ones and ended up graduating with honors. My advice, get real comfortable with Kahn Academy and similar external instruction sources and really really make a point to go to office hours if something doesn't make sense to you. You aren't the first engineer to absolutely bomb a test and you won't be the last.

For example, my high school had 11 HAIL offers, and I was the only student accepted to Ann Arbor. An old friend of mine had 14 offers at her high school, and only 2 students got into Ann Arbor. . . If you don't get in, you can definitely transfer it to UM-Flint and UM-Dearborn. I know people who have done both, as well as someone who left the Ann Arbor campus as a second-semester freshman and transferred their HAIL to Dearborn. . . You'll know that you got the HAIL Scholarship if you are accepted to a Univ. of Michigan campus, any of the three. Once your acceptance letter is in your hands, the HAIL is a done deal. I don't remember any additional letters/celebratory mail, but, at the very least, it'll be listed on your first Financial Aid award letter. If you choose to come to Michigan, get accepted, and HAIL isn't listed on that award letter, then you have every reason to call the financial aid office on campus to verify it. . . Although it's not part of your question, I want to let you know that the fine print of HAIL makes it so that, if you dip below ""satisfactory academic progress"" at any of the campuses, for any reason, the Scholarship is lost. This includes gap years, medical leaves, and any semester with lower than a C average. I wish someone had told me ahead of time, as I almost lost 2 years of tuition because of a hospital admission. . . If you have any additional questions, comments, concerns, etc., I'm happy to help! The HAIL Scholarship program is a niche group, and usually only has 50-75 freshman per year, so there's not much info available!",6.0,neutral,0.8370726704597473

A large section of the country has been coming to grips with the over-incarceration trends of the past 40-50 years, and the ongoing problems related to the heightened level of police contact with POC engaged in minor or petty crime. Trying to pass off a counterfeit $20? Call the police and lock him up. Aggressive pan handing with candles? Call the authorities, this can't be tolerated. . . . I am totally in agreement that stopping students in a hurry on the diag and conning them into handing over $20 is unethical. But I'm sorry (and will gladly suffer the downvotes for this position) panhandling is not an offence worthy of being arrested and jailed. Jail time for aggressive panhandling or fining someone who is obviously lacking financial resources have never been effective deterrents - the 90s was ripe with cities trying exactly that, folded into their larger ""war on homelessness"" (i.e., war on the poor). How'd that all turn out? . . . So y'all can keep your law and order drumbeat up, and think jail is a reasonable response to lying to you about the candles.

If you took BC, it's likely you're fluent in the fundamental concepts of calc 1 and understand further applications, so BC should be a piece of cake for you. If you took AB, it's basically like taking the course again, just in more detail. Taking BC is definitely not required -- I said ""really not that hard"".

I actually wrote mostly about literature I first saw in Economics of Crime. The class just felt a little dull to me, I honestly don't remember much . . Economics of Crime with Sara Heller is an incredible class, if it's available. I took it Winter 2020 and the in person portion with her and her GSI was very well run, and I enjoyed going to class. You need very little econ background beyond 101/102 for that class; they review 401/402 topics as they come up. It's a great insight into the behavioral aspect of Economics. I really just can't say in words how much I loved this class. Bonus is that Heller always wears really fun outfits, I missed that during remote. She's a great instructor. I was struggling at this time of undergrad and she was kind and helpful whenever I talked to her. She and Cho are my favorite professors from Michigan. . Law and Economics with Ed Cho is interesting and engaging, it's a good overview class but sometimes feels like it doesn't go very in depth. Still, it touched on a lot of the core topics of my other upper levels, so if you take it early you'll be able to figure out what is interesting to you and what's not. Taking it earlier is better than later because I see it as an overview/survey class. Really, any class with Cho is good, he's just a really good instructor. . Economics of Population with Elyce Rotella is a bit different if an angle. If you are interested in the social aspect of Economics, it's a decent class. I personally liked it because I think demographic change is neat, but some may find it a little boring or slow. It's good if you're interested in public policy since it's a demographics class. Was a pretty chill class, not much work. . Regulation of Industry with Zach Brown is a dud, don't take it if it's a thing. Bad exams, homework, lectures, projects. Pain. I really just don't think Brown is a good instructor, but maybe he wasn't adjusted to zoom yet. Idk. Don't do it. It's not worth it. . Entrepreneurship with Ben Zamzow was... I don't feel strongly any way about it. I literally just took it over the spring to graduate on time. It was kinda goofy and feels pretty useless to me. Just take a business class instead imo. Zamzow is a nice guy and cares about doing a good job by his students but this class was just weird. He was a fine instructor for intermediate micro tho. . Healthcare Economics with Amanda Kowalski was pretty well run. I also took this over covid. I struggled to remain engaged with the material at times but I do recognize it's a good class. Also good if you're interested in public policy or anything like that. . Capitalisms with Jim Adams is a very very interesting course. I had to withdraw because I couldn't swing 19 credits and this class was a lot of reading and writing, but it's a great historical look at proto-capitalist societies. More of a history class than anything else. There isn't much computational work; it's all reading and writing. If you're not looking for the ULWR, this is a MUCH better class to practice writing than Education Economics",17.0,error,0.0

But I would imagine that it is because it is easy to cheat in coding assignments since you can just copy and paste the solution. I've always been bothered by the fact that we never have any proctors in the room during exams.. 5. The thing about coding is that it isn't very straightforward. There are various solutions to achieve the same things. When you take efficiency into account, the code could look entirely different.

On the other side of the same coin, this adds a lot of plausible deniability for people who are actually looking to cheat, so a lot of people resort to copy pasting code and changing the style around a bit to make it look like they wrote it. This often doesn't work because people underestimate how unique honestly written code looks from person to person.. . 5. Even though for projects like Euchre everyone's code in theory should produce the same output, there are many many nuances and differences in the ways the code can be implemented. Every coder has a different style, functions can be implemented using different strategies, the actual structure and hierarchies within the code can be dramatically different, etc..

In the lower level it compares the output to the correct one, giving points based on a predetermined rubric. It also looks at what are called ""edge cases"", think it as dividing by 0 in math, to see how robust your code is to wrong outputs or special conditions. In upper level it considers other characteristics such as how fast the code runs etc.. . 4) The auto grader uses machine learning methods similar to TurnitIn to detect whether the two codes are inherently the same (i.e. whether you took a previous code and just changed variable names). They also probably check the code manually once it is flagged by the auto-grader. Since it is to try to pass someone else's work as your own and they have an automated way to catch it, once they catch it they punish it more harshly so it discourages people from cheating (serves as a deterrent). If you see at least 2-3 people every semester get caught by having a friend write their code or copy a portion of their code, you would be less likely to do so since the cost is to high (I think first offense is a automatic letter grade docked and 0 in the assignment) for the reward (6-10% assignment). . 5) Just as there are multiple ways to solve a problem in math there are multiple ways to solve a problem in EECS. Not all approaches are equal and in upper level courses you receive more points for writing more optimized code (most often evaluate something in fewer number of steps).. . 6) From 183 and what I heard from friends in EECS, it is mostly writing the code that solves a problem with pen and paper without access to a computer.

I went there twice my last year in grad school, and it was a completely different experience each time. The first time was fine and the stylist was nice and checking to make sure all was okay. . . However, the second stylist completely botched it. I just wanted an inch or 2 off and they only left an inch...They also didn't check-in to see if they were taking too much/too little during the hair cut (nearly every hairstylist/barber does this). I wear glasses and can't see that well without them, so I was literally in the dark until the end when I was allowed to put them back on. I could literally see my scalp.... . I don't recommend them for male haircuts. They told me they're not allowed to use clippers, which seems odd, as that's key for any short haircut as it does offer more control. Maybe it's for practice, but I've never had someone in the real world cut my hair with just scissors. When I told this to my current hairstylist, she was shocked that that was their rule.. . Also, the students are there for only a few months, so you're going to get new people each time, so you'll have to remember exactly how you want your hair to be cut/styled.

There simply isn't a way to do this with the many variables without creating a parallel universe.. .

I've literally had somebody i consider a very close friend ask if I consider her a friend. It struck me as an odd question until I realized I have the same doubts and worries as she does about all my friends, her included. All this is just made harder by COVID-induced isolation.. . Especially in such a big school, being social requires being proactive. I met my current group of friends by knocking on practically every door on my floor in West Quad last year. Most of the people I met I probably couldn't even tell you their names, but a few friendships stuck. Ask people to do things, don't wait for them to ask you. Chances are there are people waiting for you to ask them the same way you probably are. Join a club, not an intense competitive one but something that seems like a fun hobby (I joined WCBN and I've met so many people there, I have friends from it who don't really do anything besides go to the social gatherings and they're still absolutely welcomed into the community with open arms). I only have one friend in Greek life, so there are plenty of people and spaces out there that aren't dominated by that. I think I went into it with a certain idea of who I wanted to be/hang out with, and the more I let go of that the happier I am with myself, because those ideas I had were just not in line with my actual self/reality.

The way I interpret the process is that they first decide if you have 50k or less in assets/make less than 65k and then if you do, full tuition is covered. If you don't, then they go into cost of attendance/EFC calculations to determine aid.

We know, even if only in vague senses, what the university needs, not to mention that some of us (especially professors) can probably see the ""bigger picture"" (financial, psychological, political, etc.) better than the functionaries. . . The problem that Schlissel's tenure demonstrated is that these voices lack the channel to be materialized, which then leads to frustration and inactivity. The first time I heard that there is a university senate was a month ago when Shlissel got fired, and I've been here for four years. I had never heard of anyone talking about the university senate before that, which shows how little the community (especially the students) participates in the university's administration, and the fact that Schlissel remained for a year as the president after the senate passed a vote of non-confidence against him kind of justifies our inactivity. It's a vicious cycle. . . To respond to the last bit of your comment, I think the way out is def not austerity or eliminating the presidency. Quite the contrary, I think the administration will be empowered if there could be established a mechanism that binds the administration to act upon the demands of the community.

I've been saying the same thing for many months now (and been getting downvoted for saying it): The university will follow whatever the CDC says.. . In months passed, that has been to wear masks. Through this pandemic, the university has fairly consistently followed advice from scientists at the CDC over the whining moaning and bitching from students who find masks inconvenient (yes, I'm taking this jab because of how vocal some of them have been on this sub). Now, the CDC has said masks are no longer fully necessary while in-doors. It's reasonable to expect that the university will continue to follow CDC advice, and will likely loosen the restrictions. That said, it would also be abrupt for the university to go from ""fully masked"" to ""none at all."" On that, here's my hot take -- . . Here is my guess: Masks will no longer be required in-doors, except for classrooms and labs. If the numbers continue to decline, they will probably drop the mask mandate entirely near the end of the semester.. . I say this as someone who has been in favor of the mask mandate, and will continue to wear one even after mandates end. My comment history in this sub should reflect my stance on mask mandates.. . _____. . I've also been seeing a lot of people saying ""it makes no sense to require masks in classrooms but not everywhere else,"" so I'm going to clarify that point as explained by the dean of my graduate program. The fundamental difference between ""classrooms and everywhere else,"" is that students are *required* to be in classrooms, but are not *required* to be any place else. When students have no choice about where they are, the school needs to keep them safe. Where students have the option of going wherever they so please, that becomes their own decision. For classrooms, students have no choice about being there or not, and also tend to be packed together in a confined space, so personal safety becomes the school's responsibility.

Fink focused on teaching to the actuarial exam, despite only a minority of the class being in the actuarial math program. Wasted tons of time reviewing practice problems from the actuarial exam that all looked exactly the same and were all trivially simple. Felt like the class was a huge waste of time and I barely learned anything at all. Also her exams were pretty obnoxious -- all the problems were trivial but the exams were super long so you had to rush through them really fast. Also she had a policy against answering any clarifying questions during the exam, which sucked since she's not a native english speaker and would often write ambiguous questions with multiple possible interpretations. . . At the time Paul Green had very high reviews for 426, but it seems switching to 425 has brought his average down? 425 is more likely to have undergrads who aren't math/stat majors, or people in the applied program.

Honestly I wish I would have withdrew sooner and never attempted that last semester. Life changes so much the first few years after high school, I just didn't have the same aptitude and stability to get university done at 21 years old.

And it's not necessarily academic... Just how individuals view themselves, and their family expectations/contributions. Basically the haves and the have nots... I went to another college for a bachelors after I got married, had kids... But there's nothing more fun in life than intermingling with the students and being on a college campus at that age range. So it's always a worthwhile experience. At some point I realized that just being around these smart kids who are going places was enough of a blessing for someone like me.

I made a few long term friends, but wish I had the personality I do now, I would have made more.

I'll also take this opportunity to preemptively answer a question people will undoubtedly ask:. . > Why still require masks in classes and buses but not anywhere else? That makes zero sense and it feels arbitrary. . The Dean of my graduate program (not at UM) answered this extremely well. The fundamental difference between ""classrooms"" and ""everywhere else,"" is that students are *required* to be in classrooms, but are not *required* to be any place else. When students have no choice about where they can or cannot be (such as being in a classroom), the school has a responsibility to keep them safe. Where students have the option of going wherever they so please, that responsibility falls upon the individual, not the school. Classrooms are an example of places where students are required to be and have no choice, as attendance is required in many classes and is often essential to doing well. Additionally, people tend to be packed in very closely in classrooms. Due to those two reasons, personal safety becomes the school's responsibility, which is why masks continue to be required in classrooms. When a student is at the gym (for example), personal safety is the individual's responsibility, so it is their decision to wear a mask or not. Previously, the numbers were too high for this ""personal responsibility"" to be justifiable, as the infection rate gave significant risk of COVID being transmitted to others. With the numbers as low as they are now, the CDC has determined this to be an acceptably low risk.. . A similar reason for masks on buses exists for classrooms. They're essential to getting around on campus, and they're an extremely confined space with lots of people packed together. Walking is not always practical, so the same rule as classrooms follows.",220.0,neutral,0.8056937456130981

I felt like I was in a hole I could never dig out from. My self esteem and motivation ended up in the gutter, and at my lowest point I was suspended for a semester. . . I ended up changing my major from CS to Informatics (which was a new major at the time and before you could get an undergrads degree from SI), and I focused on my major GPA as a way of mentally giving myself a new start. It took my 5.5 years but I graduated. . . No employer or company I have interviewed with has ever asked for my GPA or transcripts, which are horrible. I have a great career in the field I originally wanted to work in before having to change my major, and today I think about my college career as a sobering reminder that I can't, and shouldn't try to, skate through life without effort. It taught me to plan ahead and start work on projects early, and in the end I feel like these challenges prepared me for the career success I have had. . . My advice: take care of your mental health first. Talk to the people close to you about your situation and don't keep it a secret anymore. I did the same thing and it ate me up inside. Find a way to give yourself a mental reset and don't focus on the hole you're in, and give yourself achievable goals. Take fewer credits per semester.

Take W's this semester if you can't plausibly pass these classes and see what you can do over the summer at a community college to catch up. . . I would change my goals - even if it means dropping the double major or majoring in something related but different - before quitting altogether. Hell, even transfer to a different university if you have to. Just don't drop out.

However, I should mention that I also took classes in spring/summer. Now I look back, I don't think trying to finish two degrees within the same number of years as others is a good idea. My whole year is full of classes and credits. It is very stressful and I feel like I miss many experiences. I went to psychiatrists and took medicines, had eating and sleeping disorders before. I have to say, I love the two degrees I learned, but I would never plan like what I did before. Taking fewer credits to enjoy life more is also something I try to do now. . . My friend Blueblue (fake name lol) was in CS and failed a required class many times until Blueblue cannot take the class any more. With family issues and stress, life was very hard for Blueblue and the GPA was really low. Blueblue had to change the major and the new department advisor helped with a gap year so that Blueblue can deal with the mental problems. After going back to school, Blueblue felt much better with the new major and ended up with a much better GPA, sufficient for good jobs or applying for the grad program here. Blueblue finally decided to go to industry and enjoyed the job a lot now. . . So lessons: 1. Everyone has the limits. It is not shameful and not your fault if you could not do 18 credits in a semester. 2. Taking longer time to finish your degree process really does not hurt. 3. Taking 18 credits every semester will not make you stand out. 4. Having two degrees can make you more competitive, but not a lot. It is more dependent on your experiences and what the grad programs or the companies are looking for. 5. Mental problems first.

Here's my thoughts regarding the other comments and my experience with Greek life. . . Yes, definitely rush. Honestly here's what will happen: rush starts and you'll go to a bunch of different fraternities throughout. Kinda have to be strategic here and do a little research about which ones you want to hit rather than hitting them all. All the brothers are gonna want to talk to you and you're gonna want to talk to them. And it's honestly as simple as just seeing if you vibe with them. If you do great, if not, move on. If they like you they'll invite you to a party and you'll get a first hand experience of what a party is like at that fraternity. . . There's a ton of frats, including frats that weren't exactly the popular kids either. I'd recommend just seeing if you fit at any of them. I think there's a fit for most people. Greek life is great because you'll meet so many people so quickly. You'll have all the brothers as well as sororities. It's a great time if you find the frat for you. . . If that doesn't work or even if you get in I also recommend a professional fraternity. I wish I would've joined one. It is more laid back but you'll also have a ton of access to new people and new parties. It's great to have a fraternity and/or professional fraternity because even if you're not that involved you'll still always have a tailgate to get into, a party to go to, a group to go on spring break with, go to the game with, etc. I joined other groups and a sports club and neither of them really gelled me in with other kids as much as Greek life did. . . It's very possible to have a great social life without Greek life, it's just less convenient. I've spent two semesters not in Greek life and I befriended many people also not in it. Let me tell you what it entailed: waiting in line to get into a frat party like triangle, constantly maneuvering around to ""know someone"" in a fraternity, nothing was certain and it was very possible to strike out on a given night. I've had to be a bouncer for our parties and guys get turned away at the door all the time. It's much better to be in it. . . Regarding house parties, they do exist, but again, the only people throwing house parties every weekend are fraternities and their satellite homes. You'll also be a freshmen, in a dorm with freshmen, and likely in classes with freshmen. Freshmen don't have house parties because freshmen don't live in houses. . . Those are my thoughts. Definitely consider the professional fraternity route, but also just rush because there's actually nothing to lose. This won't matter as much when you're 21 and can go anywhere or if you get a fake to go to places like slounge. There's also necto which you can get in at 18, you'd just have to pre game. I think cantina might also be 18+. . . Best of luck, let me know if you have any questions.",4.0,error,0.0

Heaven forbid anyone look at what numerous YAF speakers and presidents have said regarding their thoughts on Muslims because it's... far worse and more serious than this joke. I'm not saying YAF is an objectively evil or bad organization, but many, many people affiliated with it are known white supremacists and islamophobes. When people point this out, YAF claims they're being shunned because of their conservative values when they've had guest speakers who are white supremacists consistently for at least 20 years... They amplify things like this to seem like a victim, imo. YAF REALLY edges the line of being... a sus organization, in my eyes. Civil political discourse good and freedom of speech are obviously essential to the United States political landscape. However, when the SPLC, a vetted organization that specializes in prosecuting hate crimes and discrimination, describes one of your speakers as ""one of America's most prolific and vociferous anti-Muslim propagandists"" and that's not a one off thing (and they're not wrong!), it is a fucking awful look.. . Anyways, just my 2C/ of how YAF and political extremists in the US blow things like this out of proportion and probably know it. Obviously violence is bad, but this is almost certainly a joke (and actually referencing a real event that happened years back between a ydsa member and a yaf member iirc?). . Also, addressing bias: I tried to deliver that factually, though I must admit my bias that I hate YAF and think it fosters a hateful ideology, but I wanted to separate out that that is *my own opinion*.

There's also this [reddit post that provides a Research FAQ with links to other threads for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/otl6wa/research_faq_getting_into_research_advice/). . . Those two resources should be pretty comprehensive, but I'll also add some of mine own thoughts: . . **First step is find to a professor/lab that you'd think would be a good fit.** . . * If you haven't already, figure out your area of interest. Understanding what you want to get out of research will help you narrow down professors and make it easier to show interest to professors when you talk to them. . * The doc has a list of cogsci labs. Otherwise, you could look into department professors and faculty in your area of interest, look into what research they're doing based on their bio/homepage/papers and see if there's something you'd want to be involved in. . * You can also ask professors in classes you're taking that you like, although they tend to be even more competitive to get a spot with since being a teacher makes them more well known to more students. . . **Next, you wanna cold email them.** . . * Cast a wide net and don't be discouraged if professors don't respond - they're pretty busy people. . * There's a email template in the doc, plus additional advice at the end, that has basically everything you need for that. . . **Then there's your interview.** . . * Definitely read at least one of their papers so you can talk about it, even better if you can come up with questions about it (why did they choose to do X this way) and come up with further research questions. If you don't have much experience with reading papers, I recommend starting with the conclusion to understand the answer to the research question and the implications and then read from the beginning to understand how they got there. . * Have notes with you ready to help remind you of their research, as well as being able to jot down things that come up during the interview. . * Also I found it effective to ask about other potential professors since they have a good idea of everyone else doing similar research and who's looking for research. . . If you have the luxury of choosing a professor from multiple options, consider what'd it'd be like working with the professor for an extended period of time and if they care about their research assistants. . . If you'd like more advice and tips, you should consider [scheduling an appointment with a cogsci peer facilitator](https://lsa.umich.edu/weinberginstitute/undergraduates/current-students/peer-advising.html).

Financial aid does not really change whether you are a transfer student or freshman. Some scholarships are specific for freshman but that's about it. The issue is that OOS students in general (regardless of transfer status) do not receive as much aid, and that's true for almost all state schools. . Having that said, the transfer credit issue is very common, although I came in with over 60+ credits and many of them were given full equivalency. . Again, I checked ahead of time before taking the classes.. One alternative is taking classes at a Michigan community college for another year that will for sure transfer, and you can save money and transfer another year.",24.0,neutral,0.6048249006271362

I really liked her because she had guided notes and the exams always seemed to reflect whatever practice we were doing in lecture (and she gave little pep talks on exam days which was super sweet). The homework could get tedious, especially in 425 because there were often problems that would ask us to prove/derive a theory or equation and I usually found those kinda tough.. . However, to compare the two courses in general I'd say 412 is definitely more accessible for students without a strong math/statistics background. She teaches by going through example problems, which is a pretty effective method for what we were doing, and the hardest concepts were manageable because we got equation sheets to use on the exams. There was some overlap between the content in 425 and 412 but I noticed that 412 feels more straightforward (less theoretical), but the downside to that is it moves a little bit quicker.. . I'll also add that I walked into both courses with a heavy background in calc, linear algebra, and AP stats in high school. I would overall say that 412 felt pretty equivalent to AP stats in terms of difficulty and pace. Hope this helped!",2.0,positive,0.9390872120857239
