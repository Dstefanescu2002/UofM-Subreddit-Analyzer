Be ready to learn stuff on your own. In some fields you are expected to a certain level of self-teaching.. 11. Wait before buying the textbooks. Some professors use different books or tell Week 1 that the books are optional/barely followed. Don't buy books from Barnes and Noble or local bookstores, search them on Amazon first for deals.. 12. You may not get along with your roommate and be BFF's forever like in the movies. Just try to communicate enough to get by. College is the trial run of adulthood. If you have problems with your roommate/hallmates, try to communicate the issue with them before getting your RA involved. Sometimes kindly asking someone to turn their music down is more effective than calling the RA (there are certainly exceptions).. 13. Know what your subject entails before dismissing it or diving headfirst.

In theory, you ever really only need one, but more connections will always lead to more doors open to you.. . I wanna stress to you that you can't just ""bestie"" your way to a job at a company like that. You still need the experience to back you up.

Joining a club that's application only (or has some sort of mechanism to enforce membership/attendance) is the other best way to make friends/meet people.. 2. The school does NOT keep the community close in the sense that there are 32000 undergrads and there is no singular community. As mentioned though school spirit is great.. 3. Depends entirely on what kind of parties you like/the people you run with. I didn't really enjoy parties until I started getting invited to smaller house party shindigs as opposed to frats or big mixers.. 4. Short answer yes; there is literally always something going on every single day.. 5. There are hundreds of active clubs/orgs. Activity level is dependent on the one you choose.. 6. I won't lie, it can be really stressful (depending on what you're doing). I've basically just had a month straight of midterm exams and when I get back from break I'll have 3 more weeks of them. With that and working as well it's a lot. Full disclosure psych isn't known for being a backbreaking major though. Generally the fewer quantitative courses you have to take the ""easier"" you'll find it. Don't yell at me, saying this based on the fact that the most notoriously stressful/difficult courses here are STEM. . 7. This question is why I started to write an answer! I would say this of the queer community: it's small enough that you're probably going to be at most 2-3 degrees away from any other gay person on campus but large enough that you won't run out of people to find. Aside from that, though, there's not one ""queer community""--you'll find us all over in different subcultures. Co-ops are notorious for being a queer scene (rightly so). Blind pig/alt music scene is pretty queer. Anything sustainability/campus farm-focused tends to attract gays. East Quad/RC is pretty gay, as is Alice Lloyd/LSWA. Gay people can be found everywhere here, you just have to look. Safety, I would say, is not an issue.",4.0,neutral,0.5631698966026306

You are doing all of the right things by reaching out and trying to make up for the time you have missed. I wouldn't blame yourself as much as you are right now; sometimes, people are not going to have the greatest time somewhere, and I think it is all just a process. I know it may feel like it is too late, but do not give up. Of course, my experience is different than yours as a college student. Still, I had an experience my sophomore year where I lost everything and had to rebuild from the very bottom up my social experience and my life at my school. I felt like it was impossible, but I reached out and kept on doing so, and finally, I found some people and some things that have made my time here less upsetting. I am pushing forward, and you can too. Keep reaching out to teachers, and keep putting your best self out there; I promise you someone will see you, and good things will flow your way. It will be hard, and there will continue to be times during your last few years at UMICH that will be difficult but do not be so hard on yourself.

But I have a few questions: first, why did they leave Syria? Are they refugees? I guess what I am asking is what did they sacrifice for you versus also for them and needing to get out of Syria (I ask this as someone who knows a lot of Syrian refugees, I am not trying to presume I am just curious why their being here is all a sacrifice for you). Second question, in terms of trying to actually anticipate the fallout and what would mean for you (and therefore is it worth it) what's up with your sister? Is she in school? Could she move out with you? What will your relationship with your sister be like if you move out and the worst happens? On the flip side is it possible she will move out?. . I manage a long term health condition and I was just in a another sub the other day discussing something similar with someone who suffers from the same condition, I suspected she was Muslim, but all she said was in her culture a woman did not move out until they were married, but that her parents were not too hardcore about that but they were hardcore about her moving out because of her health. The question I had for her that maybe your parents need to hear is what happens when/if they die? Do they want you to learn how to be an adult while they are there to help or do they just want you going at it blindly when you have no fallback system?. . Last how much of this is possibly because they are terrified to be here without someone helping them translate both the language and the culture? Do you and your sister do much of those things? Maybe see about getting them involved in local Muslim communities. I was working with a refugee charity where I live and I definitely discovered that a lot of the Arabic speaking immigrants know each other and had various groups they joined--but the trick was being comfortable enough to figure out how to find them. For a while I hung out with one that was at a community center on the other side of my city where they all got together on Saturdays and worked on crafts, home projects, brought food together. Is there any chance that if you offered to go with them to some things like this you could get them feeling more confident about being without you? How long have they lived here? Did they get much help on the ground for integrating into American life?. . Last suggestion: you mention your mom's (what sounds like) hysteria a lot.

Although my parents weren't being as extreme as yours, it was very similar but with the added benefit of financial struggles due to the housing crisis of 2010.. . Long story short my older brother moved out and I stayed with the parents to help them out. He went to uofm and now has a successful career and I am left to pick up the pieces of the damage they caused.. . Let me help you a little bit with the guilt I bet you're feeling. Your parents did not move to the US to give just you a better life. They moved to the US to give themselves a better life and you as proxy. They moved to the US despite having a good life in your previous country as you described, because they were not happy due to their own personal issues. You were 12 when you moved (same age as me) you had absolutely 0 say in the decision. It was 100% their decision. If they truly wanted to give you a better life, they would understand and support you on your current decision and try to help you succeed.. . Parents like ours move to a different country and then not only hold on to the old, outdated and often nonsensical traditions but double down on them. And yes it's usually a form of control. We become super high achievers for them so they can show us off but before you know it, our own whole life has been sacrificed to their dream, not yours.. . When you have the chance please ask them this question. Why the hell did they even move to a country that promotes freedom, independence and individuality and then are surprised when you take advantage of the benefits the country has to offer?. . As some other comments have stated, the problem here is not with what you're doing, it's that your parents need some serious mental help/counseling. . .

However, your degree is what you make of it, meaning a harder working MSU student is better off than a lazy Mich student. One thing I noticed when I switched was with projects/ group work. Almost every time I worked with an MSU student(s) on a project I felt I was pulling far more of weight. Here, I feel like students are a lot more willing to help and do their part. If MSU is offering a large enough scholarship in which it would lower the financial burden, then definitely take that route.

I can also say from experience that you can be admitted to the Honors College at UM as late as your junior/senior year, but there is no distinction at graduation/on your degree based on when you started. I was admitted as a late junior, and got an Honors BA all the same. This gave me a 100% acceptance rate for the grad programs I applied to.. . Comparatively, I started my graduate studies at MSU, and the research opportunities were far fewer. Granted, it could be my field, but when I was comparing, UM had a half-dozen graduate research assistantship positions available at the same time MSU had none. . . The UM name also carries weight. I've moved to Grand Rapids, MI, now for work, and when people see my degree on the wall, I still get a lot of oohs and ahhs.

t1_jaizmwb,2023-03-01 19:52:03,t1_ja5s4ni,t3_11b7xa2,"Hey, thank you for checking up. I talked things out and have decided not to move out this year. We've agreed on a compromise where they minimize their restrictions and involvement in my life (aka I can stay out and do whatever, I'd still let them know but they won't be able to say no, which has been the case for the past year but admittedly I've taken their advice a lot of the time). . . The reason why I really decided not to go through with it is that somebody here mentioned looking at this from a utilitarianism point of view, where I consider the happiness of the household compared to mine. I figured that my happiness moving to campus wasn't worth the struggle and pain my parents would go through (as much as I hate their threats of moving back to Syria and killing themselves, I know they'd never do it but the pain they'd feel would be very real), at least not yet. . . One suggestion they made was that this would be a poor financial decision when maybe I could purchase a property. So I did more research and a financially smart decision would actually be to purchase a property in Ann Arbor. If I can get my credit score high (within a year from now) and given my job (about 100k a year), I could pull out a mortgage and purchase a condo in the middle of campus. I could rent it out to myself and/or roommates by senior year for me, and once I graduate, I can rent it out to cover costs and maybe get some passive income from it.. . I pitched the plan to them and they were fully on board and willing to help out. With this, they'd be more willing to have me move out because I'd have a proper reason (it's my property).. . Although I didn't get what I wanted, I do have a plan and something to look forward to I guess. Hopefully, in a year's time, I'll be ready to purchase a condo on campus and be able to live in it, although I do realize that it's a very long shot given so many factors (I could lose my job by a year from now, my credit score wouldn't be enough to pull out a mortgage, there may not be a good enough property to purchase, I may not play my cards right and lose money, etc..), but I guess it's worth a shot.. . I'm still disappointed that I'm not moving out. I feel like I'm going to miss out on the full college experience, and I'm gonna miss the best time to move out, but I guess it is what it is. Somebody else also suggested going to a therapist to talk this out, and I think I'm going to once spring break is over. I still don't like how they handled the situation and although it may seem resolved in the house, I'm still shaken up about it.. . I hope this also provides some insight into what your kids might think. While my parents have literally nobody else in this country to talk to, no friends, and no family (while a language barrier does make it hard, it's not a completely valid excuse because there is a vast arab community around here), I know that I would never hold my kids back just so I wouldn't feel lonely.",2.0,error,0.0

It's really easy to give the advice ""It's your life just move out"" but unless you truly are willing to cut your ties with your parents, it's just not that easy from the inside. I mentioned my health problems. Well, I almost died twice in college, and I had always planned backpack through Europe after graduating, but I did not because my parents were such a shaken mess by everything that had happened. And yes, it was my life and yes, that was probably the only moment in time I was going to have to do something like that but instead, we found a compromise that worked for both of us because I also understood that they were terrified. . Having said that, I completely disagree with what your parents did. My kids will be going off to college, and I will probably be a basket case but such is the life of a parent, especially a parent with PTSD and do not by the way underestimate the idea that your mom in particular it sounds like might be struggling with something similar just from having left Syria. I also applaud the therapist idea unsurprisingly. I wonder if the area you are in offers anything specifically geared towards refugees from the Middle East struggling to acclimate.

I'd say if you just watched like a 15 minute YouTube tutorial on the basics of C++ you'll be totally prepared for the following courses and even if you don't feel so, I really think you'll be able to familiarize yourself with the material in EECS 280 enough before any projects :). .

Love my peer facilitator but the actual seminar part is awful. It's nice for people who have no research experience but also nice for people who want to be able to say they've presented research before, since the symposium is a required part of UROP. This is really good to put on medical/grad school applications in the future. There are also some labs that only take UROP students so that might influence some people's decisions based on what labs they want or don't want to work in. Successfully completing UROP is a requirement to do the Research Scholars program where you'll do more research and write and publish a paper, but there's likely other programs on campus do that that don't require UROP. And yes, to answer a previous comment, you can get paid for UROP if you have work-study as part of your financial aid package!

Poisson distribution/exponential distribution has memory less property that makes it an ideal waiting time distribution, gamma distribution describes ""sums"" of waiting times when alpha is an integer, power law and fat tails), . . - are characterized as limiting distributions (eg. Central Limit theorem says sums of independent identically distributed random variables behave like a normal distribution). . - can be built out of the foregoing list by transforming data (eg. log normal, log gamma) . .

I decided to join the Residential College which means you're guaranteed 2 years of housing in East Quad. The housing thing is super great because EQ is centrally located, pretty new (renovated 10 years ago) and overall a good place to live. You sound like you would be a good fit for the RC (there's a lot of queer folks here and people are generally pretty serious about academics). The main thing about the RC is the intensive language requirement. You will basically do LSA's language requirement in 1 year instead of 2. Many people here really enjoy it and make their best friends through RC language classes, but for some people it can be a struggle if languages are not your forte. You'll take a placement test over the summer and get placed into either intensive 1, intensive 2, or the post-proficiency readings course. The intensive classes are 8 credits while readings is 4. I can't really tell you about the intensive classes because I tested into readings, but I took German and liked it. . . As for gluten free, I've had a really great experience so far. The dining halls label everything, so you'll always know what's safe to eat. The bigger dining halls have a gluten free pantry, which can only be accessed by students who have done a very short and easy training thing (you basically just watch a video) and has gluten free foods like toast, bagels, muffins, cookies, oatmeal, pasta, sometimes leftover gluten free meals, basically all the substitutes you could want. In my opinion, East Quad's gluten free pantry is the best out of all the dining halls. The staff here are great at keeping it stocked and taking suggestions. . .

For reference, I am also a graduate student that is in GEO and I support the strikes as well. I am not a current GSI but I stand in solidarity with my fellow students.. . 1. I agree that many of the demands in the GEO platform go further than increasing pay. Not that I don't think we should have access to such things, but it is asking for more than what a lot of other groups employed with UM don't have either (e.g. campus staff). Including these types of demands in the platform makes it easy for UM to stonewall because they can say, ""oh, well not even the FACULTY gets that benefit"" and return it with no other justification. It sucks that not everybody has access to workers' rights like GEO is demanding, but that's an issue with labor rights in the US as a whole.. 2. Furthermore, including demands such as abolition so highly on the platform I feel weakens the GEO argument. UM will never accept defunding DPSS especially after what happened at MSU recently. I support the existence of a non-armed response unit to crisis calls, but labeling the part of the proposal as ""abolition"" is misleading. Now, another perspective I think a lot of people miss is that for many marginalized groups in the US police involvement is a workplace safety issue. That is often overlooked by the generation of people in charge at UM, as well as many people on campus who may never need to worry about that.. 3. I also agree that increasing pay should be the #1 starting point. I've seen folks making comments how it's such a good deal to be getting your tuition paid for + 20k a year. It's often not as simple as that. Many masters students for example don't have funding unless they GSI, so in that scenario, a student is teaching 20 hours a week, managing their own courseload, and doing their own research on top of that. There is a lot more time commitment to the academic life as a graduate student than a lot of undergraduates may realize.. 4. Last point - GEO does not reflect the entire graduate student demographic. Many of the students in GEO come from humanities backgrounds which are much less funded than STEM backgrounds. Because of this, I think that a lot of the demands in the GEO proposals make a lot more sense when thinking about where those students are coming from and the emotional motivation for it all.. .

But this is also a lot of the foundations and algorithms that some of the bandwagoners in ML haven't taken the time to study and could be a meaningful differentiator for you.. . 445, on the other hand, is much much more math-y. Prepare to do differential equation calculus in infinite-dimensional spaces. It will also tell you how to create a ML system and the math that underlies it.

I have had UM bus drivers literally look me in the eyes while I was 10 feet away, and I was obviously walking fast/running toward the bus, and they have sped right off (in the snow). . . And I've ridden on UM buses where the driver constantly late braked, causing standing riders to nearly fall over. . . One time, I was running toward the bus at the CCTC (I was literally 10 ft away waiting at the designated space) but the bus driver only stopped for like 30 seconds before she started trying to leave. I ran up to the door and banged on it, she let me in, and I was like ""Omg, thank you so, so much! It's freezing out here""! But she didn't even look at me or say anything and immediately took off before I could sit down, causing me to stumble into people. I wrote an email to the UM transportation department to complain and request that drivers HAVE to stop at the CCTC for at least a full 60 seconds (it's obviously a very busy stop and like, what about elderly or disabled students/employees trying to board?!). . . In my experience, the city busses here aren't so bad, but some of these UMich bus drivers are so rude. . . As a former bus driver, I can say with 100% certainty that drivers who act like this are doing it on purpose most of the time. Sometimes, it's necessary to quickly brake at the last minute, especially with AA having so many pedestrians, but typically, bus drivers can just drive a little slower to avoid this.

I also fucked up my GPA over two semesters so it's kinda demoralizing to see some doors close but that's just life. You're still a junior I would say over summer, read papers in the topic you are passionate about so when you apply for professors you can show you've read the most famous topics of the area and also their most recent papers. I think they'll be pretty impressed with that.. . My other suggestion is doing sugs. That will give you opportunities to be more involved with faculty. My last suggestion is don't do research at Michigan but reach out to other schools especially for summer research internships. Also all the national laboratories do some sort of CS research and most student neglect them so if you apply to them it won't be super competitive to start as a research aide.. . I also want to be brutally honest with you.. . Not knowing if you like research and committing to do research during 4-6 years of your 20s is a big gamble so if you don't get some research (doesn't even matter if it's non-CS research). . . Also another perspective is strength of your application. If you can't find research by the time you are applying (let's say you do it in fall 2024) and your gpa isn't above 3.5, I won't do PhD. At least not right now. I would go into industry and try to come back to school. However, this is something not to worry about right now. Just worry about what's next, but when the time comes, I hope you consider this even if you disagree. CS research is extremely competitive so you can't get into the top R1 schools with some research and good gpa. For a field like ML, you will need publications too so even more competitive. I generally dislike the notion of top schools, but PhD is worth it if it's a good advisor and good program which you can usually find at top schools.

Out of thousands of students, only a handful ever vote in these elections (If I recall correctly thousand out of 30,000+ students vote).

Then EECS 280 dives a bit deeper into some of the core parts of object oriented programming. EECS 281 rounds that out with knowledge about general data structures and algorithms and caring about efficiency. What's the point of making those courses harder? Courses should not be hard for the sake of them being hard. They reflect the difficulty of the material and it just so happens that the material 281 covers is the most difficult that you've encountered so far. . . You said that you had programming experience in high school. Maybe the first two courses were easier for you because you'd seen a decent chunk of the material before so you didn't have to put in as much effort as your peers. They are difficult to those who have never looked at an IDE or snippet of code before. And now 281 is the first course where you aren't familiar with the concepts and so you've run into the same difficulty as those who haven't programmed before college.,8.0,neutral,0.662003219127655

The actual program itself provides very little structure outside of providing funding and there are basically no mandatory seminars or events so it's almost entirely up to the professor how everything works. For instance, at the start of my program my professor introduced me to two projects right away, with one of them not being all that related to the advertised project, but this one died fairly quickly. The pay is provided every two weeks. . . I was also looking to get a PhD in the future when I applied and one of the main things graduate applications look for is publications because it's the one concrete thing that demonstrates excellent research ability. Therefore, I expressed this goal very early on to my professor and I continued the research past the summer and got paid by the hour beyond the program's allocated hours. Now in my case, I didn't end up getting a publication due to a variety of factors not related to the program, but it's certainly true that you'll have a much better chance at getting a publication with the option of continuing the research past the summer as well as getting a better recommendation letter (also very important for PhD applications). . . That being said, I've never been selected for any REU program so I wouldn't be able to provide a good comparison, but I can say that I've also participated in the UROP program, and neither UROP nor SURE are particularly ""prestigious,"" yet I still had overwhelmingly positive experiences with both of them.

I disagree with this argument. Everyone has subjects that they are stronger in than others, and some courses are just going to be plain hard just because the course subject is hard. That does not mean that the course material should change or that the homeworks/exams should be made easier. If students are not being challenged, how will they learn? The degree of difficulty that is warranted is definitely up for debate depending on the class, but in my experience (both going through undergrad and acting as an IA/GSI for MechE courses), challenging work will teach students to think critically. The longer and more critically students are thinking about the subject, the better their understanding will become. Especially considering the university's reputation, the last thing they want to do is release a bunch of high-GPA grads into the workforce (or wherever they go after undergrad) only for employers and the like to realize that this ""exceptional"" student does not have a solid foundation for their work.. . Although I am not in CS (did CS minor, but ME major), I have had classes that I have found unreasonable and have encountered lots of stress because of it (anything thermo-related personally because ugh). But for me, I recognized that my par/sub-par performance in these subjects is likely a combination of issues rooted in both the course and my approach to the course. People in other comments have brought up possible issues regarding course-rigor and grading (which is mostly rooted in the University's rigorous reputation). It is up to us as students to improve ourselves with what we are given.. . U of M is meant to be rigorous, and both the coursework and course-load should reflect that. This isn't high school anymore, school is meant to be our full-time job. That is what you sign up for when you attend the university. Yes, it can be stressful and challenging for sure, and even at times feel unfair. But even among all of this, students are expected to rise up to the occasion and figure out ways that they can better improve their understanding of the course material.. . . .

They feel super run down and cinder block-y compared to any dorm on Central and the Hill, and you get to avoid the bus ride every day if you avoid North Campus (all of my classes are on central and it is a hassle bussing down there every day). A suite with two singles and a private bathroom is not a possibility for you as far as I know unfortunately, but if I had to recommend a dorm I'd say East Quad is is probably best. North (quad, not to be confused with North Campus) West, and South are also great, and Stockwell is super nice but mostly singles and is kinda dominated by sophomores. If I were you id go for East Quad, and just for reference my friend's double at East is about twice the size of my double in Bursley, and the Baits rooms are even smaller than mine. Also, it's just generally a much nicer dorm than anything on North Campus and most other dorms I've seen as well. It's a little infuriating that I'm paying the same for room and board as people who are living in much nicer places than me. . In the case you do have a bunch of classes on North Campus, go for Bursley. You probably won't get a suite with a private bathroom, but Baits doesn't have a dining hall and I would hate to have to travel from Baits to Bursley just to eat. And as much as I dislike Bursley, it's not the end of the world. You probably won't be spending much time in your dorm anyway, and I make do just fine up here. Also, having a gym right across the street is pretty nice.",1.0,neutral,0.5500485897064209

And if your goal is to attend a top MBA you absolutely need to get at least 3 years of strong post undergrad full time work experience. The average at most top programs is 5. To be brutally honest, it's not worth your time to apply to these schools without work experience--that's how certain your reject is; unless you're a literal prince or something. . . If your goal is to simply get an MBA from any program, then you can definitely find schools that'll take you straight from undergrad. These schools tend to have less elite outcomes than the top programs, but they can be a good fit depending on your goals. Still, I'd discourage you from this path. You're young and your career interests will evolve. When I was your age I thought I wanted to do international development. So I found a gig abroad and quickly learned that wasn't the path for me. If I had rushed into grad school I wouldn't have realized this until after I had already racked up tons of debt. Get some work experience in areas you're interested in, after a few years determine if you really need an MBA to achieve your goals. . . You'd have a hard time pivoting if you try to get an MBA right now.

You get the refund only a few days before the start of the semester so you have to find a way to pay for things like security deposits and potentially august rent if your lease begins at the start of august. But other than the stress of finding a way to get that money if your money covers rent in a dorm you can cover rent outside of a dorm if you get a relatively cheap place and/or are willing to share a room. Ideally something less than 900 a month will be fine and also if you believe you need more money to cover housing you can petition financial aid to raise the cost of attendance for you which would allow for you to get (potentially depending on your efc) more aid. This has just been my own experience.

I also struggled through 440, so my thoughts/advice come from that as well. . . I want to emphasize how important it is to have comfortable, high quality, broken in boots. And opt for the vibram soles if you can manage it. These were a literal life saver on multiple occasions (although, again 116 might be a bit different, but better safe than slipping). . . Also I highly recommend packing a fitted sheet for the cabins. It's nice to be able to actually get comfortable in your bed after a long day in the field. You'll have plenty of opportunities to sleep in your scratchy sleeping bag while on trips. Also bring an extra blanket if you have room! Some nights can be quite cold. In the cabins it is not bad, but one night it got in the 30s while we were camping in Yellowstone. A thick blanket made that night tolerable. . . I definitely recommend the two nalgene +water bladder set-up. You'll want a minimum of 3 liters of water on you for field days, but four is definitely preferred, especially if you put lemonade or electrolyte powder in one. It's like a lil treat, and that is the kinda stuff you look forward to when you're dying in the field. I didn't bring nalgenes, and instead had aluminum water bottles. The insulation was not worth all the extra weight.. . Bring pain killers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but also bring something like icy hot or biofreeze if you have any problems with joint pain. There's no ice at camp, so those came in clutch when I was sore at the end of the day. . . Don't worry about bringing too much clothing. You'll have opportunities to do your laundry, but make sure to bring laundry detergent/pods. You will want to make sure to pack for all weather types, it can be near freezing, and over 100 out there. I packed with a 40L backpack and a decent sized suitcase. The suitcase stayed at camp, and the backpack was used for field days and camping trips. I did end up buying an extra duffle bag when I was out there because I found it more useful to have a separate bag for clothes and one for anything smelly so that I could easily chuck the one in the van, but still be able to change my clothes in my tent while camping in bear country (aka essentially all of the camping). . Lastly, start working out now. I am admittedly not the most fit person, but I do a lot of hiking here in Michigan. It is totally different at the high elevation, and most of the hikes absolutely kicked my butt. That said, even as the slow poke of the group, the professors/GSIs never let me (and my fellow slow poke buddy) get too far behind. I know 116 is not remotely as grueling as 440, so I don't want to scare you, but it is something to keep in mind as you are preparing for it. . . I hope you have fun. While it was probably the hardest month of my life, physically and mentally, I learned so much from camp. It is an absolutely amazing experience in a beautiful place, and the perfect place to learn about geology.",2.0,error,0.0

Making $200k total compensation right out of college is a lot harder than it used to be, so people chasing big bucks might find themselves frustrated or disappointed. . . People who are looking to do cutting-edge research and coding on things AI systems are also probably going to be disappointed that there's an insane amount of competition for entry level positions, and basically no openings. . . On the other hand, there are places that offer less lucrative salaries in less appealing locations (think government/defense/health sectors) that are still hiring. If somebody just wants a stable 9-5 web dev job that starts at $85k/yr, I'd say that's more than feasible. Same with system engineering, security, data analysis, networking, etc. . . As for the difficulty of the major: I don't think that EECS is an insane workload for everybody--it's perfectly tenable for some, and hell for others. I think engineering degrees tend to be more work than liberal arts degrees on average, but CS in particular has huge variance on how challenging people find it.

I'd say to just not stress out about what you don't know. Maybe it'll be a breeze when you try it out, or maybe it'll be so hard you'll immediately nope out of the major without thinking twice.

ESPECIALLY for those of us in smaller clubs that rely on them for funding. It's very frustrating to have your $200 grant request for the semester be rejected by them over ""funding availability concerns"" when they're apparently spending tens of thousands in such a flippant manner. I'm not sure how long this $125k was supposed to last (as in if it was meant to be for the semester, year, whatever) so I'm not gonna speak on that but still.

Maybe just think about which category you fit into below or add another category that you fit into better. These are just my thoughts and how I think about this topic every time it comes up on Reddit. . . 1) If coding is tolerable to you, then it's a fine path for a degree. However, so is EE, so is ME, and many other engineering degrees. People don't often discuss the fact that your major does NOT define your future job. It \*might\* define it, but it doesn't have to define it. Getting a technology-focused degree (EE, CS, even ME) opens up a lot of jobs in hi-tech companies that don't require you to design circuit boards or even write code. Technical marketing Engineers, Product managers, and even Sales Engineers (if you've got the social skills) are all great jobs and MUCH easier to get at a technology company if you have a technical degree. I would say that EE is much more prevalent among these roles than even CS.. . 2) I'm fine with coding. I don't particularly like or dislike it. . . You could go be a mediocre programmer and likely make above average money over the course of your career. You will not make the crazy money that people often associate with CS majors. Sorry, but that is reserved for the next category. Even so, go make some money. Use that money to have amazing experiences in life and remember that the grind is about funding what you actually enjoy (traveling, eating amazing food, flexibility to work remote to be home with future kids or take care of aging parents, etc....). . . . 3) I don't shower because I MUST...NOT...STOP...CODING! Ok, I hate that people constantly make this joke about CS/EECS majors but I said it anyway. If you just laughed at that first sentence and didn't think, just for a second, ""oh! I get that!!!"" then you will probably never really reach the crazy money levels that people associate with CS majors. Some people are just built differently. When they see a problem they don't think, ""oh that's interesting"" and move on with their day. They think, ""I MUST SOLVE THIS!!"" At that point, time fades away. They don't eat, they don't sleep, and yes, they don't shower. Like Sylar in that early 2000's tv show ""Heroes,"" when they see an interesting piece of code, or product, or problem, all they can think is, ""I MUST KNOW HOW THAT WORKS!"" In all likelihood, you will never know the names of these people. There are exceptions to this rule: Sergey, Larry, and even Kevin Fu (IYKYK) who's a little closer to home. In general, they don't particularly care to be known or even really care about the money all that much. They code and problem-solve because they must do it. . . . . Just some food for thought.",2.0,error,0.0

Maybe the professor's inclusion of 4 lectures on Box's loop and 3 lectures on variational inference in their 451 class (beyond the standard intro, sampling, modeling bits of a Bayesian inference class) might have sped the pace of 451 up too much, causing the negative reviews?

Let x(x, t) represent the smelliness factor as a function of radial distance x and smelliness scale t. To consider fluctuations at all length scales, we introduce the renormalization group transformation:. . x'(x', t') = R_t[x(x, t)],. . where R_t denotes the RG transformation and x' and t' represent the rescaled distance and smelliness scale, respectively. By applying the RG transformation iteratively, we can analyze the behavior of the smelliness factor across various scales.. . Next, we introduce the dimensionless RG function, b(x), defined as:. . b(x) = t'(x/t').. . By solving the RG equation:. . x(x, t)/t = b(x),. . we can determine the fixed points (x\*) where b(x\*) = 0, which describe the scale-invariant properties of the system. Additionally, by analyzing the stability of these fixed points, we can determine the relevant scaling behavior of the smelliness factor.. . By employing the RG approach, we obtain a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the EECS students' smelliness at all length scales, ensuring the protection of people from potential olfactory hazards. We trust that our revised theoretical model addresses the concerns raised and merits reconsideration for publication.. . Revised research paper title:.

A referral is how I got my current offer, as well as my previous internship that I returned to for a few summers. It really is the best way to get your foot in the door. Not sure what your major is, but Michigan has a huge alumni network, so maybe see if you can make some connections there. If you have a class you're doing well in, ask the professor if they can put you in touch with someone who used to be in their class that has a job you want. Be creative and a little shameless. . . Once you have your foot in the door, experience is the next major hurdle. But, it doesn't necessarily have to be from an internship. Look at your class projects, or even personal projects that you are proud of. Find highlights from your time at college that you can show off. Try to pick three things, make sure to highlight them on your resume and cover letter. This will also help during interviews.. . Speaking of which, write a cover letter. It's a great chance to describe to the recruiter why you would be a good fit for the job. Look at the posted job description, look for requirements that you match. Highlight and describe those.. . Also, I don't know your situation, but often when applying to so many jobs and with such minimal criteria, you end up wasting a lot of effort on stuff that just isn't going to pan out. Instead of 50 per week. Hunt down 10 that you feel you would be good at and you would be excited about. Put a little more effort into each one. You have a better chance of standing out, and you appearing committed to it is a big plus for a recruiter as opposed to a copy and paste application. . . Lastly, look for internships in addition to full time offers, even after grad. Often they will pay less, but have a lower bar to actually get it since it's meant to teach you. Then after three months, you will be a top candidate for a job opening at that company. When searching look for keywords like ""post grad"" to help narrow it down.. . Hope that was a little helpful.

I think the critical thinking soft skills of IR is very useful especially in business negotiations (I find some my more math centered colleagues woefully lacking in the ability to think what the opposing side will think or say though it seems obvious). The people I graduated with in 2013 mostly went to dc as interns , I joined the army as an officer. I don't know what career path a pure play non Econ ir would have outside of a masters. The dc fellowships my friends from the army in later years got didn't pay great. To me, thinking of risk benefit id just choose the one that gave me the most options and that would be a focus on Econ.

I have nothing against it but I'm not into it. I'm also not into sporting events (getting to and from the big house on the weekends is a 45 minute ordeal since bus routes are limited on the weekends).. . 3) I'm heavily involved on a project team in the Wilson center on north campus and also work on my own projects there.. . 4) I like how north is quiet and I feel like nature is more visible.. . The gist is that my free time is spent entirely on north campus as well as most of my class time. I think the free time holds more weight than classes because the busses are great during working hours on weekdays. They suck on weekends. I would hate north if I had to ride a bus home at 3am every weekend after getting shit faced at at a party.. . It's worth mentioning my roommate also loves north (along with another friend of mine) and neither are very involved with student project teams so that isn't a requirement. Both are in north campus colleges though (Engineering and Stamps).. . Other pros to north. - north campus student parking lot is the biggest so freshman have the best chance of getting a permit. - both Bursley and bates are right across from the NCRB (the only fully functional gym on campus right now). It's busy if you lift but I've always been able to do cardio and the sauna is a godsend after a workout. The pool is a nice option too. Central has a gym in a tent and the IM building which I've never been to but is near the big house.. . . Some things I don't like about north. - Bursley is the only dining hall and I was sick of it in October. - restaurants are just not as accessible as they are on central and everything that I know of in the north campus union is closed on the weekend.. - the busses suck on weekends.. - my dad was in Bursley his freshman year (in 1990).

I was a UofM transfer student. Came from community college with 60 useless credits. I've just recently graduated. . . During my first semester, I dropped from 12 credits to 8 credits (and I only got a B in both classes). Not sure if it's still the case, but for the first term (maybe the first year?) transfer students can drop courses without getting a W. Financial aid also won't be impacted unless you make a habit of falling below full-time status. . . It took me over a year to figure out how to work around UofM courses. For future terms, I'd recommend starting on Atlas. For each semester, I never took more than two courses with an average workload greater than 30% or an average grade of a B+ (or less). If historical syllabi were available for a specific professor, then I'd also read those so I knew what to expect. Using these two methods, I was able to enroll in 14-18 credit terms that felt manageable. . . Additionally, a large number of resources were available for each course that I enrolled in. Any resources that didn't help me with the first exam were dropped right away. For example, if lectures in a class just summarized the textbook, then I would save 3-4 hours a week by not attending lectures for that class. Alternatively, if the textbook felt useless, then I'd stop reading it. Same with study groups, practice work, etc. Dropping useless resources makes it far easier to invest time into useful ones. . . When it came to loneliness, I stopped trying to make friends at UofM. It didn't take long for me to start making friends at work, the dog park, or with people in my apartment complex.

Im also white, and you are correct with most of the kids are either asian or korean. But they also dont really know as much either from what they've told me. Sure they may know some vocab, but alot of it is also new for them, especially when it comes to sentence making. So dont feel intimdated. Also the teachers ask in the first week how much korean everyone knows, and they will put those who know more into an advanced class.. . First of no, the teachers dont speak in full korean. If they do they translate what they said into english right after. Or they will start to use words from our vocabulary, its not hard to follow at all. They also ask if anyone has any questions so OFTEN. jilmuniisseoyeo, eobseoyo? Is ingrained in my head. . . I will say first, its a 5 credit class that meets everyday, so of course the work load will be more than any other class. Assignments consist of writing, online workbook, and listening and speaking assignments. With these its mostly a completion assignment, they dont mind if you mess up they just wanna see that you're putting in an effort. Occasionally with the midterm and final you'll do extra to prepare for those. They give you a reasonable amount of time and often want a rough draft to correct before you turn in the final.. . There are weekly vocab quizzes that follow the workbook you get. I recommend taking these seriously as they were the reason I got a B+ last semester. (I recommend using the memerise they set up, and hand typing in the answers. Youll set yourself up for success this way) i went from getting 13/20's to 25/25's. . . The teachers also really want you to succeed, they're very kind and patient when you try answering questions, and theres 0 shame when they help you fix your sentences. They understand how different it is from English and are very excited when you take interest in Korean/ culture. . Overall when i felt i was beating myself up for not being good enough, i remember i once didn't know how to read hangul at all. Now i can comprehend a lot. I plan on using TTMIK to help fill in some gaps, and have a more casual way of speaking. I also am choosing to take the 200 level next semester and going abroad to korea next summer.

I found Ivy schools to be stuffy and uninspiring, but that's just me! It depends what you're looking for. If you go to an Ivy you do always get that sheen on your resume, I don't think I fully understood how much people value that, even years after college. But Ross is a pretty big deal, And Michigan is a very well known, well loved school. You'll find alumnae all over the world. . . Yes, tours are physical.. although I'm sure with Covid and all that there must be some online versions.. . Okay- yeah you would register for a tour in person here- . . https://admissions.umich.edu/explore-visit/visit-campus. . But also if you scroll down they do have the full campus tour in video format you can watch.. . I actually used to give tours at Michigan while I was a student and it was super fun. I found the tour experience (as a prospective student) to be really helpful in getting a vibe of the campus and the people when I was looking at schools. . . I remember I toured schools in the middle of winter- at my top choice at the time, Northwestern, kids scurried from class to class without looking up. The campus felt dead. No one seemed happy. I could see myself just sinking into constant anxiety in that world (not trying to say anything bad about Northwestern, I'm sure people have good experiences there, it just didn't feel right to me). . . The next day we toured Michigan, a place I actually didn't want to go bc I thought it was too big. It was equally as cold, but students were throwing frisbees, a cappella groups were singing and there were a bunch of other student groups diligently doing things. The campus felt really alive and inspiring to me. The tour guide seemed smart, thoughtful and confident. And that made my decision for me! . . Yes, it's an education, but I feel that equally as important are the friends and connections you make while at school. Sure, I've gotten jobs just from my resume. But a lot of the opportunities I've gotten are because and friend from school recommended me or connected me with someone who helped mentor me, etc etc. Also these friends become your friends for life! Surrounding yourself with great people who help you grow, emotionally & intellectually, is really important. The school you choose should feel ""right"" to you, in that warm and fuzzy way. . . If you can't tour the schools in person I would see if there's at least an online tour of the other schools you are considering so you can get a better feel for which might be the best fit for you.

When I eat on campus, I go to the dining halls and try to stick with soup and salad. The salad bars here are underrated. They have eggs, cheese, tofu, beans- all things with lots of protein. One hard boiled egg has like 70 calories and 6 grams of protein. 1 oz of feta has about 70 calories and 4 grams of protein. You could easily eat 2 salads (dining hall salad bowls are kind of small) with 1 egg and 1 oz feta each and have 20 grams of protein. It's also nice because you can build the 2 salads in different ways each time, offering you lots of flavor and diversified nutrients. . . For me, if I eat 1 protein bar (20 grams protein) on my way to school, 2 smallish salads for lunch, an average dinner, and small snacks, then I typically get like 40-60 grams of protein a day. I vary this though. Like sometimes I'll have a protein shake instead, or I'll eat the protein bar for lunch, oatmeal and an egg for breakfast, and have a cheese stick or roasted chickpeas for a snack to meet that protein goal. . . If you're not so worried about calories, just eat whatever you normally eat, then add a few extra protein snacks throughout your day. I'm obviously a big fan of eggs, but there are also things like nuts, seeds, string cheese, peanut butter and apples, snack sized protein bars, roasted chickpeas, Greek yogurt (as others have mentioned), etc. For meat eaters, there's also jerky or simply adding an extra chicken breast to your meal. . . There's a common misconception that we need a ton of protein to be healthy, lose weight, build muscle, etc. I recommend you look up your recommended protein intake and compare it to what you're already eating before worrying too much about it.

I would like to see evidence of that. From what I can find, typical year-over-year wage increases from CBAs have been above 2% every year except 2010-2012. Public sector CBAs tend to be lower, but they were 1.9% in 2020, 4.2% in 2021, and 2.6% in 2022. Again, these are year-over-year raises for the first year of the contract, not over the entire contract. [bloomberg data](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/strikes-fuel-biggest-pay-raises-in-labor-contracts-since-1990). . From this data, then, a 1-1.3% annual raise would be below average for public sector CBAs in recent years. Typical increases over 3 year contracts for public sector CBAs have been 2.6-2.2-2.1 in 2022; 4.2-2.8-2.9 in 2021; 1.9-1.7-1.7 in 2020. Moreover, this excludes the bonuses that are included in many CBAs (but not GEO's). Including these bonuses, the increases are 3.6-2.3-2.3 in 2022; 5.0-2.9-2.9 in 2021; and 3.0-2.6-2.6 in 2020.. . Also, one of the main GEO claims over at least the last decade is that they have been underpaid; hence why the previous two contracts (2017 and 2020) explicitly fought for contracts that included above-inflation wage increases. Those gains have been more than wiped out: the aggregate wage increases for GSIs from Fall 2017 to today is 18.3%. Aggregate inflation over the same period is 22.4%. In this sense, simply looking at a ""typical"" increases as a measure of a good contract for the GEO--which, again, 1-1.3% annual increases would fall below this--wouldn't capture this historical context.. . That is, if you thought the union was underpaid in 2017, then the 5% initial increase would be inadequate as it would likely not even get them back to where they were in Fall 2017 after adjusting for inflation: they would need a 3.5% raise *today* to get back to where they were in Fall 2017 in real terms. Using the Philly Fed's projections for inflation the rest of the year (Survey of Professional Forecasters), a 5% raise starting in Academic Year 2023-2024 would leave them poorer than they were Fall of 2017 in real terms",8.0,error,0.0

Each credit is one hour in class there's a website that kind of explains this part [better](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/lsa-academic-policies/registration-and-enrollment/course-credits-and-contact-hours.html) you need a certain amount of credits for every major requirement which is different depending on what major you do and what school you are in. Here is some information about[full time vs part time](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/lsa-academic-policies/registration-and-enrollment/full-time-vs-part-time-status.html) . You don't pay per credit if you are a full time student you just pay tuition if you are between 12-18 credits. Here is some information about how [part time would work](https://sph.umich.edu/admissions/tuition-fees.html) . . . Tldr credit hours are how much time you are expected to be in class and how much time you are expected to work on homework.

The civic number includes, among other things, ""(3) pets, and (4) toys, (5) hobbies, and playground equipment, (6) other entertainment supplies"" and ""(9) education"" which the school already pays for. I do not think 22 year old GSIs are buying playground equipment. Even if you have Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, Chegg, Dashpass, that would be (10 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 10)\*12 = 660 a year, not 2959. But let's be generous and round that up to 1000. So that's another 1959 worth of savings. Next we have medical. [GradCare](https://hr.umich.edu/benefits-wellness/health-well-being/health-plans/gradcare) means that GSIs have 0 monthly premiums and $30 copays in the majority of cases. It also has a 3000 out of pocket maximum which means that the 3108 number for medical is the MOST you could spend and would basically mean that you were in critical condition the whole year or you are on several very expensive branded drugs all year. Realistically most people are going to have no more than a handful appointments in a year and at the most pay a few hundred dollars in copays considering the typical age of GSIs. But I'll be generous, maybe they have a non-generic drug they are prescribed, and say 1000 a year in medical. That's another 2000 in savings. Housing at 12564 is high - you can get studios on Central for $950 a month and definitely can split a 2 bedroom with someone for 800-900 a month. Unless you insist on living by yourself you could easily take 1000-2000 off this number, but again I'll be generous and say 1000. So that's **2621 + 1959 + 2000 + 1000 = 7580 in savings** I identified not looking very hard.. . . There are others too but I'm getting bored. You don't need a car in this city so transportation should really be closer to 0 than $5,356 even accounting for airline tickets. It's not completely clear what goes into ""Other"" but it seems even if you were buying new hairbrushes, toothbrushes, deodorant, razors, toothpaste, mouthwash, paper towel every week it would still be pretty difficult to spend $4,811 in a year.",-5.0,error,0.0

To answer your second question directly: I recommend a mixture of self-study and group study. I also want to emphasize that exams are performance events, similar to a piano recital or sports competition, and so practice + preparation are paramount. I highly recommend these 8 Essays on Teaching, Testing, & Learning, by Prof. Coppola:. .
