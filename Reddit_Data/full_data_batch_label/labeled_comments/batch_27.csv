.
. My two cents:
.
. He was a person in a position of power and ""dating"" an employee. In any business setting that is taboo, but in a public university with explicit rules against that (rules which he created) it is unequivocally prohibited.
.
. Now, on to the sad reality: the guy was lonely. His wife is a lawyer ""based in San Francisco"" whatever that means. So here's an older guy, staring into retirement and old age all by himself. It is any wonder he would seek out some companionship or accept love from a woman who \[gasp\] actually seems to like him?
.
. I scrolled through the emails expecting something tawdry, but it was all very ordinary - where to eat dinner, recommendations for sightseeing, forwarded articles from the New Yorker. Maybe there are more scandalous emails not released, but this strikes me as just old guy conversation. Again, wrong to do it, and wrong to use university email and resources.
.
. **Psychologically, I think deep down he wanted to get caught.** Here he is, unhappy, lonely and wanting a change. He probably didn't have the courage to pull the plug himself. But if he gets caught, his decision is made for him. Someone else will kick him out of his job, his house, and get the ball rolling on the divorce.
.
. A lot of people here are students and are glad to see him go. That's fine, but you might want to withhold judgment until you're married and 55 or 65, with a big house and a good job and still lonely. I hope it never comes to that. It sucks big time.",3.0,neutral,0.4965569078922272

In contrast, positive feelings rose more evenly across the entire income range, and even had a directionally steeper association with income above $80,000.

You'll be dipping into game theory and econ and ethics, etc. etc.. . That said, there are issues in the program and the school knows it. They shouldn't tell students they'll be data scientists--the rigor isn't there for that. Moreover, the undergraduate program is very new and is still being built up. Potential students should know and plan for this and find opportunities outside the classroom, of which there are plenty. Use the opportunity to become the thing you want to be *before* you graduate.

There was someone at WCC whose job was essentially to streamline the process of transfer students looking to transfer to UM. She was able to tell you what classes would transfer, what grade you'll need in order to transfer, etc. I recommend you trying to see if WCC still has this person or someone who can help in a similar capacity. They are always great about this stuff.. 2. It won't affect your GPA once you get to UM, that'll start new once you get there. With that said, you might need a certain grade at WCC for UM to accept it as a transfer credit and count it as a T. Can't remember what it was, but I vaguely remember this being the case. Guidance office should be able to help with this. Keep in mind as well that when applying for jobs, companies might ask for your cumulative GPA from college, so then you'd just do the math to combine your WCC and UM one.. 3. Also, to what others said, they'll ask for transcripts from all institutions attended when applying to grad school, WCC included.. . Good luck! Hope this helps",3.0,neutral,0.645658552646637

It gets knocked into our heads again and again that poultry is safe to eat only when its juices run clear, when the meat is no longer pink, and when it registers at least 165deg in the thickest part of the thigh. But of those, only temperature is the real indicator of a fully-cooked chicken. The USDA says that as long as all parts of the chicken have reached a minimum internal temperature of 165deg, it is safe to eat. Color does not indicate doneness.. . The USDA further explains that even fully cooked poultry can sometimes show a pinkish tinge in the meat and juices. This is particularly true of young chickens whose bones and skin are still very permeable. Pigment in the bone marrow can color the surrounding tissue and make the bones themselves look very dark. Hemoglobin in the muscles can likewise react with air during cooking to give the meat a pinkish color even after cooking.

Here's my take.... . 1.) can't totally answer this question since winterfest was online this semester and I totally missed/forgot about it. I heard it wasn't the same anyways, so i'll just go in the fall. I do believe that it's the business/ross clubs that are harder to get into, but I think if it's something more like pre-med or running club it'll be easier to get into. . . 2.) Im not a CS major, but I know umich CS is no joke. I definitely recommend retaking that intro class here at UM especially if you feel like you didn't get a solid start off at MSU. As for the writing class, see if it transfers here: https://transfercredit.ugadmiss.umich.edu and also google umich first year writing requirements for more info.. . 3.) I also had a similar situation my senior year of HS, I was sick a majority of the year and my grades slipped up a bit. I was super worried about this, but I kept a 3.94 in college to prove that I could still work hard. As long as you're still working hard to maintain your GPA high in college, you'll be fine. They will look at your college and high school transcripts, but performing better in college proves to them that you can handle this level of academics well. You said you've kept a 4.0, so I'm super confident in you, and you're already proving that you can succeed in college. . . 4.) I remember seeing this question on the application, and I think it's there it just collect information on their transfer applicants. It shouldn't effect your decision. . . 5.) yes!!!! and they're super cute!. . Feel free to DM and ask any more questions!! Good luck! :))",2.0,neutral,0.656640350818634

I transferred as a junior. While I was at the community college, I got my Associate's Degree, taking care in selecting as many classes I could that would transfer either as LSA requirements, or as departmental credit. You'll want to eliminate as many courses at the community college as possible that are required for the college you get accepted to at U of M, since the U of M versions tend to not only be more difficult, but also grade on a harsher curve.. . > Other than more weight on hs stats, is transferring after 1 yr at cc more difficult?. . I actually can't really comment on this, because I had no valid highschool transcript for U of M (homeschooled) and was at the community college for 3 years. I don't *think* how many years you were at the CC for matters though, since only a maximum of 60 credits (62 if you get an associate's degree) can be transferred anyway.. . > 2) How hard was it to adjust to umich? How did it feel coming in as a transfer into a more rigorous environment. . Started out that way but that notion was quickly killed in my 2nd week, when I saw someone stroll into class higher than Ben Franklin's kite. At that point I realized other students at U of M aren't necessarily smarter than CC students, just provided with better opportunities.

I enjoyed just having access to *whatever* near campus.. . > would you say transfers have a hard time adjusting here(friends, towns, academics, internships)?. . I'll be honest, I'm a massive introvert and did not come to U of M to make friends. By senior year I had made some acquaintances, but never hung out with people. Internships didn't matter a whole lot either since I knew I'd be heading to grad school straight after graduation.

Rather than seeing a bunch of slides with a bunch of random facts, try to piece everything together.. . I highly recommend you do every practice problem they give you. They way I treated those questions was essentially like an short-answer, even though they are MC: for each response to every single question, write down why that option is wrong and when it would be true. (For example, if they ask which enzyme catalyzes a specific reaction, write down what each enzyme does and where it comes into play.). . Try to engage with the material in as many ways as possible. Office hours, Piazza, lecture, practice problems, discussion, study group, etc. If you still think a tutor would help, I think the professors have a couple names of previous students.. . This is very tedious, but it helped me actually understand the material instead of try to memorize a bunch of facts. Our brain is very intuitive and likes to tie everything together rather than pull disconnected bits and pieces, but this requires a little more effort from our end.

Set: you need to have a good mindset. You need to remove yourself from emotions that will get you distracted. By remove - I mean you need to deal with them. You also need to be determined and get your mind in the mode for studying. Get yourself hyped. You need to get rid of your phone (turn it off), put on your backpack, and get all your pencils in order, do whatever. *This applies to studying in your room.* Yes - if you're gonna study in your room, take a shower, get dressed, put on your shoes, your backpack, and walk to your desk. It does wonders to mentality.. . Setting: most people with ADHD prefer distraction-free environments, especially if they're primarily inattentive. HOWEVER, I do find that some people with ADHD do enjoy settings where other people are visibly studying. If you're studying in your room at a desk, you need to clean your desk, get pencils in order, get your material out, and get into an academic setting. . . Method: use the Pomodoro study technique. In this method, you set a time where you work without allowing yourself to cave into distraction - it can be 15, 20, or 25 minutes. After this period, you close your books and you can look at your phone or browse memes for 5-10 minutes. You can then do this rotation for 3 or 4 cycles, and then you take a long 15-20 minute break. Think of this as doing sets and repetitions at the gym. You do x reps, you take a break. You do this to avoid being exhausted and to get more ""volume"" from your workout. In the same way, in the Pomodoro technique, you take intermittent breaks to allow yourself some time to be distracted deliberately, which seems to help you focus.. .

I had a locker and they had a fridge + kitchenette so I could essentially live out of there.. . For daily meals: PBJ, sandwiches, leftovers from cooking, fruit, energy bars, rice with various toppings (100% recommend, super easy) and canned porridge.. . For desperation meals: I had cans of soup and ramen and frozen foods in the locker/fridge. A bag full of high protein/carb snacks like cliff bars, crackers, etc.. . Tips I learned from this:. - for PBJs and sandwiches, you can layer the fillings so they won't get soggy. For PBJs you can put a thin layer of peanut butter on each bread slice (think ur normal amount, but halved for each side) and then the jelly in the middle so the PB protects the bread from the jelly. For normal sandwiches, I would put spinach/dry ingredients adjacent to bread and wet ingredients (tomatoes, mayo) in the center.. - many buildings on campus have microwaves you can access. Off the top of my head: East math hall, school of education, Dana, School of Social Work, Ford, Palmer commons, etc. Some of these also have dishes you can use (and return).. - cliff bars are usually on sale/have a deal at Kroger/Walmart and much more filling/energizing than nature valley/Quaker. - sugar rushes aren't a thing but sugar crashes are. If you're out for a while and need energy, I would recommend staying away from sugary energy drinks as the crash is terrible. - sometimes you're not hungry, you're dehydrated.. - a pack of tortillas are like a dollar at Walmart and are literally the most versatile things (besides rice ofc). You can make quesadillas or burritos with basically random things in your fridge. Cheese + deli meat, tomatoes, onions, etc. Very low effort.. - Pack things that make you happy to eat them. A little treat, snack, candy bar. helps with the urge to buy food for dopamine.. . And since I'm on a roll, some general food storage tips I wish I had known earlier:. - for soft fruit, like peaches, they tend to go bad quick or get bruised when you bring them outside. There's a technique called macerating that makes them last longer and you can carry them in Tupperware.. - mushrooms in the original container/plastic containers will attract moisture, and moisture in there will make them go bad very quickly. I 100% recommend getting brown paper bags just to store mushrooms in them as they last so much longer. Same with carrots and cucumbers. Basically any veg that shouldn't be stored in a wet environment because it will start to go slimy.. - you can regrow green onions with no effort, just pop them in a jar of water and continue to snip as they grow",17.0,error,0.0

My point is that being gay is just a sexual preference, and while people associate certain stereotypes with gay people, a lot of people either aren't the stereotype, or they grow out of the stereotype. You're still allowed to dislike people for their personality, even if they happen to be gay.

When it's less of a jolt to you, then maybe you can more carefully consider the issue. . . I say this because I feel I've always been a fairly socially progressive person, but I grew up in a small conservative town, and being an older person, all my formative years were spent in a time when most people stayed closeted about these things. I found that my allegedly progressive principles didn't stop me from feeling some shock when I witnessed people being more open with their non-binary, non-hetero, non-confirming identifies and sexuality. It was jolting, but that jolt was NOT because I was possessed with some god-given or inherent bodily knowledge that it was somehow wrong or against natural order--it simply came from lack of exposure and being deeply steeped in other cultural norms. Over time, it has stopped being a jolt.. . I think you're right about it being culture shock. Ann Arbor is different, not just because there are more people here who express those identities, but you're also surrounded by more people who grew up differently and have been taking these differences in stride for years. My kid who grew up in AA doesn't bat an eye over any of the stuff that was a WOW for me. That's partly because of his generation, and partly because of where he grew up.. . I can't tell you what to believe, but I would like you to know that a lot of the things we take for granted as ""normal"" or ordained by a higher power are simply cultural. Religion and spirituality can be fulfilling and wonderful guidance through life, but teachings about religion can be shot through with very human and unfortunately flawed notions.

I can only do it half-decently if I have another instructor/GSI/staff to monitor the Zoom while I'm teaching to monitor the chat and relay questions to me, and only works for classes that don't involve a lot of discussion/interaction. I can't concentrate on the class material if I'm also monitoring Zoom and the physical classroom at the same time, it's hard enough teaching a good class in just one modality at a time! It also takes me 10 minutes to get everything set up to work properly in the classroom and on Zoom at the same time, which means rarely starting on time since it's hard to get into the classroom with other classes clearing out at that time.

It's also worth mentioning these comments were made the same week (and possibly even the same day) he gave [an interview](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/administration/daily-sits-down-president-schlissel-mayor-taylor/) where in response to calls for the university to do more to prevent the large parties and greek events that had still been happening during the pandemic he said ""I get a little insulted when everybody says there's no way that students are going to wear masks, and there's no way that they're not going to party in dangerous fashions, and there's no way they're mature enough to recognize the importance of the moment and behave like the adults that you all are.

t1_huhkbzl,2022-01-27 20:33:05,t3_se1z4d,t3_se1z4d,"Hey OP I've been lifting for a really long time, gotten great results and it's a big part of my life. Here's my advice for your situation, hope it helps.. . * You need to start eating a lot more food than you're used to, it doesn't all have to be clean either, you need more calories. This is hard for a lot of people because we equate health and fitness with skinniness and weight loss, but you have the opposite goal from a bigger person trying to slim down.. * Aim for at least 1 gram of protein a day per pound of bodyweight. Start reading nutrition facts and googling ""grams of protein in ....."" Supplement with protein powder as needed, but get most of your protein from food. Animal sources are preferred, meat, dairy, eggs, and fish.. * Start taking a men's multivitamin immediately.. * Do less cardio for the time being, even for warmups, your warmups should be with lifting. If you need cardio, do it in a fully separate session to have more energy for your lifts.. * Structure your workouts in a way that hits every major muscle group in a cycle, or ""split"". For beginners I strongly recommend (in this order):. . 1. Day 1: Mainly chest, some shoulders and triceps. 2. Day 2: Mainly back, some biceps. 3. Day 3: Legs. 4. Day 4: Shoulders, biceps, and triceps. . * Do some abs at the end of each workout.. * The first half of your workout should be sets (increasing in weight as you go) of 5-10 reps of the heavy compound lifts corresponding to that day's muscle groups (bench press, incline bench, shoulder press, dips, barbell rows, deadlifts, pullups, squats, leg press), then the second half should be higher rep sets (8-15 reps) of your isolation exercises (dumbbells, machines, cables, etc.). Less reps, heavier weight will help if you're going for strength, powerlifting style workouts but it seems like that isn't your current goal.. * Train for at least an hour, on a minimum of four, maximum of six days a week. If this feels like too much volume just eat more and sleep more. You shouldn't be burned out in six weeks (in the future as you progress it's good to take a week off lifting every two to three months to let your joints and central nervous system recover).. * You need to be sleeping a lot and sleeping well and avoiding alcohol, weed, nicotine, etc. Moderating is ok, abstaining is a lot better. Caffeine has pros and cons, can help your workouts but don't let it screw up your sleep schedule and appetite.. * Drink as much water as you can tolerate, like be drinking water all day basically.. * You should be steadily progressing, either more reps/sets (volume) or more weight as you do the same exercises, increased performance is a good indicator that your body is adapting to training stimulus.. * Get advice and learn as much as you can about different exercises, which foods are good for muscle growth, etc. Google stuff a lot, and prioritize results from [bodybuiding.com](https://bodybuiding.com), [t-nation.com](https://t-nation.com), and [generationiron.com](https://generationiron.com) (unfortunately there is questionable advice out there). When you see a very strong or muscular person doing some unfamiliar exercise or routine in the gym, it's a good idea to ask them about it.. * There is a small chance you may need to add more salt to your diet, especially if you're someone who eats very clean. Pickles are a healthy way to do this.. * I personally would recommend avoiding a super strict planned workout like the ones you see online a lot which prescribe exact numbers of sets of each exercise. I know some people have a lot of success with these, but I find it to be too inflexible to the fact that each person's body is so unique, it's good to be able to tune it in as you figure out what's working for you.. * Be realistic with your expectations, unfortunately it does take time to see noticeable results, but don't let that discourage you from starting. If you make a good start during this six weeks you may have laid the foundation for a very healthy and rewarding long-term lifestyle change, and with more time if you're consistent, you will be surprised at the physique that's achievable for you. By the time your trip comes, you'll probably be hooked on working out and want to stick with it.. . Best of luck and I know no one person will have the perfect or complete advice for you but I hope something in there helps. Good luck!",41.0,error,0.0

Depending on if there is a class before yours, there can be no time to setup the livestream before your class begins. Also the podium equipment is often a mess. I've come into classrooms where the batteries are dead in the wireless microphones. Typically I run to another classroom and steal some batteries from there and fuck another instructor over. I've come into classrooms and the microphone was missing. For that situation I once again stole from another classroom. However sometimes the podium audio mixers/receivers are digitally locked. This required me to download the specific manual to find out how to bypass the lock so I can change the microphone frequency to match this rooms specific receiver. I've come into rooms and the whole receiver settings are fucked by either another instructor failing to troubleshoot an issue or some student fucking with it. I've also had issues where simply zoom refused to work with a specific audio device and the whole computer was replaced because it was onboard audio. Also the lecture machines are somewhat locked down, so I use a laptop for demos that require more complex setups. This now requires me to manage two computers for lecture, as I can't patch the room video camera to my laptop.

As someone who started out in the RC and later dropped it I think I can provide a slightly skeptical pros and cons list (which can be a helpful counterweight to those coming from people still in the RC):. . PROS:. . 1) RC provides two years guaranteed housing in East Quad (EQ), located in Central Campus. Living in North campus is difficult, since you are further away from social life (frat parties, football games, bars) and have to take the bus every morning to go to class, cannot stop by your room to grab something easily etc. If you are unsure about RC, getting in and trying it out will not hurt you since living in EQ is worth it by itself.. . 2) RC's first year writing requirement (FYWR) courses are taught by faculty whereas most others offered by LSA are taught by graduate students. RC's FYWR courses, RCCORE100, are usually more interesting and the class is 99% going to be in East Quad, where you live, making it easier to commute to class (or if it is your first class of the day, sleep in). . . 3) If you take multiple RC classes, it is easy to make friends since there is a decent number of overlap between peoples schedules. . 4) RC language courses are intensive and satisfy the LSA language requirement in a year (2 semesters) as opposed to 2 years, opening up time to take other courses.. . . . CONS:. . 1) RC has additional requirements, if you are in a major with minimal breathing room or want to do an ambitious double/triple major those extra 4 classes can be tough to fit in. . 2) RC classes are primarily focused on humanities, so if you are not interested in humanities there are few options to take those required 4 classes. . 3) RC has a arts practicum requirement, meaning either music or arts. If you are not particularly talented in those areas, like me, it might be hard to satisfy the requirement. . 4) RC languages are intensive and tend to eat up a lot of time. They are 8-10 credits so they take up most of your schedule as a freshman and might make it hard to catch up if you are taking a major with lots of pre-reqs that build up on each other. Furthermore, the RC language classes also require a lot of time, meaning if you want to get a good grade (which you should since they are heavily weighted in your GPA) you need to take time away from other courses. I had a hallmate drop a class so they could focus on RC Spanish more, which was eating a lot of their time.. . PRO/CON depending on person: . RC Students are some of the most liberal people on campus. Even though most of them are open minded, it might be difficult to find a groove if you are conservative or conservative leaning. On the other hand if you are liberal, especially a more left leaning liberal, you will find a lot of like minded people. . . **Brief aside: Why I dropped RC?** . . I didn't know about the additional requirements and after waiving the language requirement, RC didn't offer many benefits and in fact imposed more requirements (4 courses). After failing to find any RC course that interested me and switching to a more quantitative track, I dropped RC. I am still glad I joined since I got to live in EQ for two years as opposed to North Campus.",8.0,error,0.0

Gonna second dating apps, they do kinda suck sometimes but they can help a lot, especially if you're socially anxious (I feel you). It's a little dehumanizing for both parties involved, but if you're struggling to get matches, just trying to match with like a stupidly large amount of people can yield results. At least if you're het, I can't speak for other sexual orientations. This isn't immediately helpful, but as someone who doesn't perform so well in group/social scenarios, I never really found bars or clubs to be very helpful unless you also have a group to go with but then that gets a little awkward and yadda yadda. Honestly most of the time to meet new people just initiating conversation over pretty much anything works out. Just saying hi, talking about the weather, if you're on an empty bus, just any excuse really. If you recognize them from an older class, that's a massive help too. I think most people end up being receptive and that little foothold can go really far, and if they aren't they usually just ignore you, which can hurt a little but don't take it personally, you're not entitled to a response and all I suppose. As far as bars go, especially Covid-friendly ones, there's not much choice I'd say. Though then again the last time I went to one was a few months ago and that was the Blue Leprechaun, which was pretty alright I guess. If you're of a certain persuasion there's usually a meetup in the basement every month or two there. But yeah, just try to keep your head up!

I also really like living with other honors students, because it makes meeting up with other honors friends a lot easier (which you can easily make if you elect honors-related classes). I actually met my closest friend rn at an ""honors campus tour"" during move-in week, and we hung out a lot after because we lived in the same dorm (made meeting a lot easier). another cool thing is that we have our own academic advisors, so I think it makes meeting with an advisor a bit easier (I'm pretty sure we're still allowed to go to the regular advisors too). if you're on the fence about it, I'd just apply, because you can always just drop out of honors if you absolutely hate it.. . edit: also, if you don't want to engage with honors that's completely fine! the requirements are minimal (p sure it's just that you have to take an honors first year writing req, maintain a 3.4 gpa, and do the thesis thing at the end), so it can easily just be something to put on ur resume. . . another thing - if you hate the idea of a thesis, I think there are other options you can take (like I think you can do a project instead).",4.0,positive,0.9460732340812683

I could be entirely wrong, but just figured I would give it a shot. Let me know if you disagree!*. . Anecdotally, I would guess that the number is around ~75%. I'd only guess this high of a success rate because in order to declare, a student needs to pass the prerequisites like 203 with a sufficient level of performance. These prerequisites exist for students to exhibit a certain level of competency before the department is willing to let them have a shot at the program. Thus, students who are able to actually declare the CS major aren't super likely to crash and burn.. . I think that if the question was rephrased to ""what percent of students at UofM who pursue CS at all end up graduating with a CS degree"", I'd guess the answer would be considerably lower. Maybe somewhere around 25%, or even lower than that. CS is a really hot major right now and is essentially an instant ticket to an upper-middle class lifestyle. I think a lot of incoming students Google something like ""highest paying majors"", see that it's possible to sign a 200k offer letter at 22 with only a bachelor's degree, start salivating, and decide that CS is their new passion.

It's when you work on frustrating tasks while someone else also works on a task with you (not the same task, just the same time). Helps anchor you to the present task, and often if someone else is being productive I'm compelled to be too. Methods are:. * Calling up a friend to work with them (IRL or over Zoom/Discord). * Working in a place with other people who are also being productive. * Using a site like www.studystream.live which is like chatrooms just for studying. * Accountability partners. Tell someone what you need to do and when you need to do it by, and get them to help keep you accountable. I sometimes text my roommate my top 3 priorities for the day and when I need to do them by, and she texts me hers. Throughout the day we just check in with each other on how we're making progress.. . **Approaching the Task**. . * Plan for the long term/start early. Sounds like ""duh"" advice but seriously, it gets so much harder to work on a daunting assignment as it gets closer to the deadline. I start to get paralyzed with anxiety and then numbness to deal with the anxiety. So, I'll at the very least take a look at it when it comes out. Force myself to read it, maybe make a planning doc. I then force myself to visualize and understand the timeline of how long I actually have to do it, and what else I have that may interfere leading up to it (I have a homework tracking app that sorts assignments by due date).. * Organize it. The hardest part is usually starting, and once you get going it's not as bad. For me, my workaround to starting as in ""do the thing"" is ""organize the thing"". I make a document titled ""\[Class\] Assignment - Planning"" and put down the following: Assignment name, Due Date, Word Limit, Prompt, Instructions, Rubric. It's all easy information that doesn't take much brain power to do (just copy+pasting from Canvas oft times) but it helps me feel like I've kinda ""started"" on it and also reorients my perception of what I have to do.. * Make a plan. Once I've organized it, I'll go through it logically and make a plan on what I need to do. It's not a complicated one. Copying from an essay last year:. * To Do:
. 1. Block out skeleton
. 2. Find evidence from sources
. 3. Write (body, conclusion, intro)
. 4. Format
. 5. Proofread + check against examples
. 6. Works cited. * Just get started. It's hard but sometimes you just need to force yourself to do it. Make it easier by tricking your brain, like ""I'll just work on it for 5 minutes"". I also use ""3-2-1 FUCK IT!"", where I'll literally say that out loud and force myself to get into starting position. . . **Doing the Task**. . * Set rewards for completing tasks and assignments. Also goes along with time tracking, which is a good way to make sure you stay on track and don't ""cheat"" early with the reward. 2 hours of work = 30 minutes to watch youtube, etc. Pomodoro method is popular.. * Also, one reward mechanism that I found works for me is the app Forest. I'm motivated to work more because each hour of work I log I get coins, and the more coins I get the more cute little trees I can buy. Also, the interface is really satisfying and I get satisfaction from looking at my study stats and seeing the numbers. There are other free apps with tracking mechanisms you can look into but I find the reward mechanism of Forest to be very motivating.. * Remove distractions. For me this means leaving my apartment and studying somewhere that doesn't have snacks, chores to do, and a couch. Others use extensions/apps that block distracting sites, or move distractions out of sight (ex: hiding the TV remote).. . **Overcoming Mental Barriers**. . * Also, that feeling where you just can't do it, you don't have the energy/will to focus on it? In ADHD we call this under-stimulation, where you get so overly *bored* that you just can't do the thing because the thing is isn't appealing or engaging enough. This can lead to scrolling through social media aimlessly trying to find something to just give you that energy to *get up and do it*. How I get rid of it is by finding something engaging that will give me a little boost of dopamine/energy to refocus myself.

Yost had a theory for the nickname, which he wrote about in the Michigan Quarterly in 1944. Yost felt the reason for the nickname concerned the trading of wolverine pelts which occurred in Sault St. Marie for many years. The trading station served as an exchange between the Indians and other trappers and fur traders, who would eventually ship the products of to the Eastern United States. Because many of the furs were in fact wolverine pelts, traders may have referred to them as ""Michigan wolverines"", leading to the state nickname and ultimately to the University of Michigan representation."". . >""Eight years later in the Michigan Quarterly Review of 1952, Albert H. Marckwardt presented another theory for the ""wolverine"" name. Marckwardt's reasoning is based when Michigan was first settled by the French in the late 1700s. The appetites of the French who made up a sizable portion of the settlers were judged to be gluttonous or ""wolverine-like"" and therefore, the title wolverines was set upon them."". . >""The last theory surrounds the border dispute between Michigan and Ohio in 1803. While the two sides argued over proper setting of the state line, The Michiganders were called wolverines. It was unclear, however, whether the Michigan natives pinned the name upon themselves to show their tenacity and strength or whether Ohioans chose the name on account of the gluttonous habit of the wolverine. From then on, Michigan was labeled ""the Wolverine state: and when the University of Michigan was founded, it simply adopted the nickname of the state it represented."". .

My summers were always about working as many hours as possible, often 60+ per week. I always had a job at school, and they never paid nearly as well as my job at home does, so I scrimped and scrounged for as many hours as possible while in classes, too. I took out the vast majority of my loans for my final semester, so I spent the first three years without having very much/any spare money just to go do fun stuff with. Besides, given how much I was working, I feel like I missed out on a lot of social stuff, too. Also, it helped tremendously that I graduated a semester early. . . TLDR: I was in a somewhat similar situation. I got through it okay, and of course it feels like it was worth it now that I have the diploma. But it took a lot of hard work and would not have been worth going into insane amounts of debt for.",9.0,negative,0.6860382556915283

I knew I wanted to declare it when I first got to college, but taking more and more classes and engaging with other FTVM students outside of class has really validated my choice there. Definitely be prepared to collaborate with others constantly, you'll meet so many people who are also trying to be creative on production things and you have to be good about working with a variety of personalities. If you're going the production route, there will be a lot of time spent outside of class coordinating and putting in the hours shooting/editing/etc, and that only becomes more true the more shoots you get involved with outside of coursework. There are some history/theory classes that are required for the major that a lot of people hate (I didn't, I liked them a lot bc I was personally interested in it), so there's a good variety of the ways you approach the three portions of the major. . Basically, there are so many interesting routes through the major, you can really customize/pick and choose the things you work on, but the classes that are required of every FTVM major are a lot of work--often outside of the classroom too. .

There's just a theme so you have something in common with your neighbors. . . Maybe it has changed, but when I was in MSTEM, they didn't really have any special connections to internships above what a normal CoE student can access. They encourage MSTEM alums to network with current students, but that doesn't mean a lot. The rest of the ""MSTEM career events"" were typically just ECRC events that anyone could attend - but we were required (or strongly requested) to go. The MSTEM students who snagged internships with the big companies that financially support MSTEM (at the time I remember bp, ArcelorMittal, maybe Microsoft?) as underclassmen were already highly desired by employers - they were candidates from underrepresented backgrounds with strong GPAs. I personally did not receive any help from MSTEM in securing my internships. (But I found internships just fine using the ECRC career fairs and online portal.) . . MSTEM did encourage a lot of students to find funded research the summer between freshman and sophomore year. But I think anyone could do that through [SROP](https://rackham.umich.edu/rackham-life/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/srop/). They basically just made sure we were aware of that program. . . A MLC won't claim to help with internships, but I don't think you need help above what the ECRC provides. You just need to take the initiative to engage with the ECRC. (Which isn't something all freshmen know to do.) . . One MLC, MRADS, is focused on research. So you have an integrated research program through the MLC. Outside of MRADS, all freshmen can apply for UROP research - regardless of where you live. Many participants in certain MLCs (notably WISE and HSSP because of the stem focus) are involved in UROP research. There are also plenty of people who live in a regular dorm and do UROP. . . When I say a MLC provides support and community, I mean... There are better RAs with more budget for events. There are ""peer advisors"" - sophomores who lived in that same MLC as freshmen who are there to help you out. There is dedicated full-time (adult) staff for academic advising / support / programming.

Also, my advice - head over to Northwood and take a quick look around and see which area you'd most like to live.

The whole world knows this is a tough school. So, it's only a question of how far down the list you need to go. Even better, if you can maintain a 3.7 GPA, that's a really good average. You might not get into a top 10 PhD program (they could fill every slot with 4.0 students but they don't because that's not all that matters) but 3.7 is good enough to get you into the SUGS program for a master's in CS here at Umich and into someone's PhD program.. . Finally, if you are concerned about maintaining really good grades, your best strategy is to stick to a manageable courseload. Everyone at Michigan is really smart and the #1 reason why a student might not do well is they're taking too heavy a load and don't have time to do all the work. Twelve units is enough to be full time and 12 units of A's beats 16 or 18 with a bunch of B's and C's any day of the week.. . A distant second reason a student might not do well is that they just don't like what they're doing. Occasionally, students will major in CS because they've heard there's a guaranteed $100K job waiting at the end. But if you don't actually like CS, don't do it. No one should waste their entire life in a career they don't like. As Steve Jobs observed in his Stanford commencement address, to do great work, you must love what you do.

Also, note that the Honors Program is only for your first two years at Michigan. After that, if you want to graduate with honors, you should pursue an honors thesis (but there are people in the Honors department who can help guide you through that). . . Pros - you can really choose your level of involvement in the program. If you just want to use the program to make friends and live in South Quad (a better dorm), that's perfectly valid. As part of the program, you get an Honors advisor who will be your main advisor as opposed to a general LSA advisor so it might mean slightly more personalized attention from your advisor. Also, you get to take Honors Core classes that are only open to Honors students; these classes are often smaller, discussion based classes (and usually have an A average). As another comment mentioned, you can also convert a non-Honors class to Honors by doing extra work and being in the ""Honors"" section if there is one, and that is open to everyone. Honors is flexible with how you want to stay involved in the program so you can really make use of it as much or as little as you want.. . Cons: If your intent is to stay in the Honors Program both years, there are some Honors classes you must take in your first two years but I think it's only 1-3 classes so it's not too much of an issue, but it does take up that space on your schedule. . . I'm personally not a huge fan of my advisor (BUT there are some great advisors I've talked to in Honors so hopefully you get one of them as your primary). . . The best way to connect with the Honors community is through the dorm experience and classes, so if you choose not to live in SQ or take honors classes, it can be hard to find that community.. . I think you should give it a shot and apply to Honors anyway; you can always choose not to accept!. . Hope this helps :)",7.0,positive,0.7841482758522034

(check out the website for information on the sophomore honors award if you really want to). . the flex: i mean, do you like to brag about superficial stuff? i guess this is something nice to put on your resume (it'll definitely fill up a line of space).. . disadvantages of honors: i think some honors kids are definitely pretentious, but then again more than half of the student population wears canada goose. i honestly can't think of any disadvantages. . overall: honors is a good thing to join at least for your freshman year because it's low effort and you get guaranteed housing on central.. . congratulations on getting accepted, and i hope you'll definitely consider joining honors!",2.0,positive,0.8192276954650879

The big thing about having parents who went to college is that they can help you navigate the system and plan for things. I didn't know what I didn't know, nor did I ask the right questions. Big learning curve. . . If you're coming right out of high-school or HS -> CC -> big college there are a lot of smaller local scholarships for people who went your schools, went to schools in your district, or your county/ region. Look for ones put on by local business, clubs (rotary, Kiwanis iirc, business leagues), future X of Y orgs (just as a made up example: future Psychologists of Norhern MI), etc. Every couple hundred dollars chips away at what you're borrowing and over many years of repayment adds up. Each dollar saved may save you a few dollars in repayment.. . I think working at UMich, which was my intention, isn't going to happen. I have work study money available and no time to work. Maybe next semester IDK. 15/hr sounds good, but with how bad the labor market is right now, someone with a CC degree might be able to get closer to 20/hr or more, and not have to deal with being in mgmt.

t1_hwo4ddg,2022-02-12 17:39:30,t1_hwnikq2,t3_sq8wxl,"Thank you for your thoughtful response. However I have to disagree with a few of your assessments.. . > you seem to be somewhere in the engineering dept. . My majors were in EECS. However the course I taught were not. My boss' PhDs are actually in education and psychology, with his dissertation on assessment. The class I am referring to with him was not in education or psychology. But he can talk to you endlessly about assessments, outcomes, and how motivation is probably the largest part of that. Just curious, have you ever written a lesson plan, taught, or had training in assessment?. . > Your boss has decided to offer to put a C on an engineer's transcript.. . To be clear, the offer of a C grade is in exchange for an extremely high level of competency in the course material well beyond what the time and constraints of the course can normally offer. Also I should mention the course is extremely highly rated by students, the university admin, and outside institutions (although I personally disagree with my former boss on how rigorous the course is).. . > in the types of jobs where the difference between a mediocre corporate gig and a good one can be up to 50k a year. . I cannot speak to much outside of EECS majors, but from the data I have seen, there is only a small correlation between GPA and income straight out of school. Definitely not to the effect of $50k. When EECS majors salaries are cost of living adjusted, the difference in pay shrinks drastically. Essentially once you meet a certain GPA threshold, there is very little difference in pay between a GPA 3.0 and a 4.0 (the average GPA of an EECS students is well above a 3.0). Now the long term earnings data is more compelling, essentially your GPA is hard to even correlate to your earnings after a few years.. . In tech, most of the big companies realize this. Google doesn't even really consider your GPA (https://www.businessinsider.com/how-google-hires-people-2013-6), since they have been unable to demonstrate a correlation to success in their company. Anecdotally as someone whos involved in hiring, I also do not look at your GPA. As the market for CS majors is in such high demand and there is low supply, GPA is really not used that much. . . Competency and grit is really the strongest factor for predicting earning potential (take my former course if you want the data on that). . . > This isn't viewing the grade as ""more important"" in some abstract philosophical way. It's recognizing that the grade will, necessarily, have more of an impact on your life because of the shit way that industry and corporate employment works.. . Its funny because your points to do not disprove at all what the point of my boss' offer is. You've just extrapolated one step further. The students want the grade more than the knowledge/skills, because they think it will earn them more money. The issue is, they are making locally suboptimal decisions, that does not have any strong data to support it. Its really just short sighted. . . > If most of the class is succeeding in their assignments without watching the material, the material isn't necessary for the assignments and is therefore useless in the context of the class. . I think this demonstrates your naivety. ""succeeding"" in your statements really only comes across as GPA. You can ask my former boss how well GPA is for assessment now a days. The average grade given in a university course is now an ""A"". The utility of grades have dropped drastically since the Vietnam War. This is because you could get out of the draft if you had a certain GPA in college. So in response to this, universities started to inflate students grades. If the current GPA trends continue, in less than 10 years, the average GPA of a college student will be an ""A"". The norms of this and the obsessive nature of students to get a good grade regardless of their competency in the course material, has destroyed GPAs as an assessment tool. So when you say the ""most of the class is succeeding"" and overwhelming amount of students believe their grade is them succeeding. In reality, the most instructors use of grades are a terrible assessment tool for learning outcomes.. . Not all material in a course, that was selected for learning objectives, is assessed too. Depending on the course, there could be several reasons for this. Time and budget constraints are real, even at UMich. The course instructor may have selected those materials because they believe it will lead to the best learning outcome. Students are assessing the material as not necessary because they can manage a good grade without doing them. Most of the students are making that decision without thought of if this material is needed to meet the learning objectives of the course. The classic question of ""Will this material be on the exam"" is a perfect example of this.. . > And I feel like when a large majority of the students in your class have figured that the material isn't important. . Students are making that decision because they view the material (really the lack of assessment on the material) has little impact on their grade. Not that the material is good for learning outcomes.. . The instructor decisions to point out the fact they can see how long you watched the content and to increase the assignments related to that content (which is an assessment tool on that content), is all done to realign the assessment tools with the students' motivations (their GPA), which will actually increase the learning outcomes. If this was done from the beginning, there would be no complaints from the students (and we wouldn't have this reddit post), its only because the expectations changed mid-course (because of academic dishonesty) are there complaints. . . But I will mention again, I haven't seen the course material or the assignments, so it could very well be terrible.",6.0,error,0.0

Here is their website:. https://annarborpsych.com/prescribers-2/. Family Care Psychiatry also had openings, although you might have to wait longer.. https://fcpsychiatry.com/. . As for therapists, in-network therapists have a co-pay of $25 per visit. I would call BCN to confirm, but last I checked there was no limit to the number of visits per week or per year, as long as they are in-network. I would look on psychologytoday.com for their therapist listings, and just start emailing/calling therapists whose profiles seem to fit what you're looking for.. . Also, if anxiety and depression have been really intense and are affecting your ability to function, partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) can be immensely helpful. New Oakland in Ann Arbor has one, and U of M and St. Joe's have one as well (although I think U of M and St. Joe's have a wait-list, New Oakland doesn't).
