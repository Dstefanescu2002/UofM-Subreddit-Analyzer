""Students are still coming back to Ann Arbor and will still be having parties and get-togethers, but two weeks online would allow the health department to better asses the spread, limit some cross-social group contact, and provide a safe option for students and faculty who feel uncomfortable with attending in-person classes in a period of heightened spread with a new variant that we know little about."". . The university does not have the ability to shut down Rick's or off-campus gatherings, but they can help limit exposure between social groups and with the greater campus community (faculty and staff) by postponing in-person classes. It is impossible to fully prevent the spread of covid from students returning to campus, but the intent would be to limit it.. . Also, I don't understand how mentioning the current covid surge helps your point. That surge is occuring mostly without the influence of omicron and holiday gatherings, and will only get worse when those factors come into play.. . The bottom line is that we don't know how bad omicron will get. There is a (good) chance that the preliminary data holds and that overall hospitalization rates decrease despite increased spread because the variant is significantly milder than what we have been dealing with in the past. There is also a (realistic) chance that the high rate of transmission means that overall hospitalizations increase despite the lower probability that an individual case results in hospitalization. A 2 week shift to online does not stop covid on campus, but it allows us to err on the side of caution with a relatively small sacrifice when we are dealing with these unknowns.

There was also a stronger sense of community. Classmates helped each other and met outside of classes. Exams are always based on the primary lecture material so that students can adequately display their understanding of said material.. . At universities like Umich, everyone is just a face in the crowd. Professors lecture, then push students into GSIs and/or make students attend very limited office hours. Students don't know what's expected of them until after the first exam and/or never quite know what they're expected to learn.

My upstairs neighbors and I had a bit of a war between each other and the leasing office handled the situation very well. Basically, my upstairs neighbors were lying about my dog barking because they wanted to get out of their lease. My neighbors agreed that my dog never barked (I can't recall if I had a camera in my unit at this time)- but the leasing office ended up allowing the upstairs tenants out of their lease. Out of all of my previous apartments, I appreciated that I was listened to. The unit was clean and looked great, I got my full deposit returned at the end of the lease. Downside is that the apartment isn't too big and it's pretty expensive. My bus commute was typically 15-20 minutes.. . I also stayed at **Pheasant Run Apartments**, they were pretty hit-or-miss. The units are big and nice, the community is great. The leasing office is pretty rude. If you have a roommate that doesn't turn their keys in at the end of the lease, then the company will make you accountable for their rent (in this case, the office will automatically renew your lease). Maintenance enters your apartment without prior notice. You get a very large unit when you consider the cost of renting in Ann Arbor- and it's only a 20 minute bus ride from central campus.. . **Also, I know this post is about leasing companies...** but I did have a landlord in the housing-converted-into-rentals sorta apartment. My landlord's last name was Hwang. I would not recommend any apartments owned by him. Rent wasn't *that* cheap (850), there was mold that made every overnight guest sick, none of the plugs in the unit were grounded (including the bathroom), the heat went out for 3 weeks during the snowy winter. If anyone confronted the landlord about issues (such as heat or mold) it often led to the landlord screaming, swearing, and acting very unprofessional. The unit was not clean and due to ""historical value"" the carpet looked like it was from the 80's (orange), was balding, and took about 3-4 carpet cleaning sessions to get clean-ish. This apartment was about a 15-20 minute walk to campus, I didn't take the bus because it took 30+ minutes.. . Currently, I reside in Ypsilanti because I can commute to the south side of campus and take a 10 minute bus ride to central. Ypsilanti apartments aren't too-too much cheaper but there's quite a bit more amenities, space, and other benefits that are offered.

As for 281, while I know lot of people skip lectures and the class is doable without going (can just rewatch at your own pace online), I highly recommend doing the following for your projects to get them early and with slightly less frustration:. 1. Read through the project spec within the first few days it drops (usually a tuesday/wednesday). . 2.

Living between two environments (college and home) is incredibly mentally stressful, not to mention the stress of actual school. Without having a good support system on campus, it is SO intimidating to be at school. I was in that boat last year. After my first semester in my dorm taking online classes, I still felt as though I had no friends -- and this is coming from an extrovert! Our winter break/time spent at home was extra long too (from thanksgiving until late January) so once I settled back down at home with my family no part of me wanted to go back to campus. While I had the option to stay home, I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and go back. . . Turns out, second semester freshman year was the best months of my life. I randomly met some of my closest friends, found a routine that worked for me, and figured myself out quite a bit. I was absolutely terrified to go back, and now I can't believe I ever worried at all. I remember sobbing in my bed at home the night before I moved back to Ann Arbor and a week later sitting in my now best friend's room for the first time. . . I know things are tough, especially with covid, and some of us struggle just a bit more with these brand new social and academic environments. I feel you so hard and wish I could show you a glimpse into the future. You may feel anxious now, but I promise you will learn and grow so so much in the next few months. Also, winter semester tends to go by a bit faster (IMO) so you'll be out before you know it. . . As for your loneliness, I recommend finding a couple people whose company you like and getting to know them better and finding ways to get closer with them. I met almost all my current friends through new friend's friends. And trust me, even as a sophomore my friends are changing by the minute -- college is not meant to feel so permanent, which is something I struggled with. I also recommend joining clubs and finding things to do with your time. I have found wonderful communities in the clubs I joined and even made some close friends in them too. Lastly, I'm sorry about your living situation. I struggled with mine last year too. I'm not sure what it entails, but feel free to DM me if you feel like chatting or just need somewhere to vent :) I know school is so overwhelming, but you're gonna get the hang of it and I promise so many people support you.

Instead of saying something stupid, a lot of times we get guys trying to be super frat and *doing* something super stupid.

Students want the option to remote learn.. . Any narrative to support that gets upvoted. Any narrative to refute that gets downvoted.. . I love remote work too but I'm not going to blindly downvote anything that refutes it, especially when half the population is all about screaming ""trust the science"".....but only when it supports their narrative.. . As for as the actual logic and decision tree behind covid policies it's simple. Does it create a public safety risk? Yes? Then we'll have policy to address it. . . What is the pubic safety risk that matters with covid? Overloading hospitals. . . If 99%+ of the campus is vaccinated then your odds of overloading hospitals is just not there given all the research and data we've got of hospitalization rates among the vaccinated and unvaccinated and the total student body count. It's not even close. It really is 100x less likely between vaccinated and unvaccinated people who catch covid. There's no reason for any institution to be advocating for measures that affect THE ENTIRE student population other than to be overly conservative. Being overly conservative always has trade-offs. In this case it's devoiding the student body of the in-person experience (although I could definitely see the argument to have online as optional but alas). UofM has determined it's not worth it and I can't really blame them. There's no data that shows taking two weeks off has done anything other than delay it (queue: the jokes about ""two weeks to flatten the curve"") until everyone is comfortable going out to bars and social events and that's where it actually causes large breakout infections.. as many scientific studies have shown. Other countries took a shutdown approach once omicron was first discovered to assess and see its effects and so far it isn't drastically different to the point where vaccines are drastically useless or where the symptoms are drastically worse. Again there's no reason to be this conservative for really really small slices of the student population and that's the unfortuante truth. It's different when you're talking about overloading hospitals and someone who got into a car accident has to die being transferred around hospitals because the first two ERs they got sent to is full. It's another when John is at high risk and can't afford to catch covid. John should take the semester/year off as crudely as that sounds.

A multi-layered cloth mask works very well when it provides a tight fit around the face. [In some research, tight knit quilted cotton achieved higher particle filtration than N-95 material.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252) Studies examining aerosolized dispersal from masks identified a majority of the leaks coming from the gaps around the masks, not through the material, in pretty much all mask types. This redirected leakage mixes particles with the air at a much lower rate and shorter distance than direct spray out of a mouth. And communities with widespread mask use, regardless of mask type, have experienced significantly lower rates of infection, typically directly proportional to the rate of mask usage.. . Omicron is so infectious though that any leakage at all poses a threat of spreading infection. Since a majority of mass-produced cloth masks don't provide a tight fit at all, regardless of material quality, they lead to higher rates of particle leakage, leading to the general guideline that cloth masks in general are useless. It's certainly true that N-95s are vastly superior to pretty much any other widely available mask type due to both material filter efficiency and the mask design allowing a tighter seal around the face. But not all cloth masks are created equal, in general they have worked very well until now, and a multi-layered cloth mask with tight-knit cotton worn with a tight fit to the face is far from useless even with omicron.. . Like a lot of top down guidance around Covid, this advice has been the result of experts and decision makers thinking the general public will get confused by the nuances of the research (or themselves not quite grasping the details).

Similarly, you speak about prioritizing mental health, but if we really want to improve that we should focus on access to services for students, faculty, and staff. We should talk about active community engagement and, perhaps, mode of instruction. But the latter cannot be used as the single piece of the puzzle to solve mental health issues derived from the pandemic. Look, I'm an international GSI who was literally forced to move back to the US to teach less than 14 hours in person this semester, pay double rent, and fly unvaccinated; the U is using this argument to avoid making explicit their real priority: money. They make significantly more money with in-person instruction and students being on campus than online and that makes sense; but as an instructor myself I am tired of hearing that my student's mental health depend exclusively on us teaching in person.

I went to college in Eastern Europe, where there were no syllabus. The first sentence of every first lecture I attended was ""I will denote the n-dimensional space of real numbers by R^n..."" or something along those lines (we were supposed to know the professor's name already, because we should have looked it up in the departmental directory). When homework was assigned, we did it; when the exam date was announced (which happened around the time of the last lecture), we showed up at the appointed time to take the exam. Most exams were oral, and what questions to ask was at the discretion of the examiner -- anything that was relevant to the class material could come up, and the exam lasted for as long as it took for the examiner to decide what grade the student deserved. Sometimes people were asked to come back another day to continue. . . I came to the US for grad school. A stack of Xeroxed copies of the syllabus was passed around in class, while the professor would say, ""Good morning, I am Professor Such-and-Such. In this class, we will be studying applications of algebraic ring theory in New Zealand film industry. The syllabus is being passed around; make sure you get a copy. I will denote the n-dimensional space of real..."" We took the paper syllabus home and read them after class.. . The syllabus, presumably, is a page or several pages of everyday text. Is the professor expected to dedicate almost 4% of overall class time (in a twice-weekly class) to do a dramatic reading of it? What's the value in that? (Aside, maybe, from a vocal technique class in SMTD -- that might be a fun exercise.) If you have 2-3 lectures to decide whether you want to take this class or not, wouldn't you rather be exposed to as much of what the class content is *really* like? If something in the syllabus needs additional explanation, then the explanation should be included in the syllabus document -- or the document should be re-written more clearly altogether.. . Look, I've been kind of facetious so far, but in truth, I am genuinely curious: **what would the students find useful and helpful, and worth the reduction in lecture time dedicated to actual course content, to discuss at the beginning of the first lecture?** (assuming that the syllabus document exists, is well-written, and contains all the ""course logistics"" information the professor can provide at the beginning of the semester) -- and, conversely, is there anything logistics-related that professors tend to spend time talking about in the beginning of the first lecture that would be better to put down in writing in the syllabus instead? Let's set aside whether the students and professors like to have an ""easy pass"" day on the first day of classes, and talk about what's actually useful.. . One thing that comes to my mind is bringing up the course Canvas site or website, to quickly show where to find various pieces of content (notes, homework solutions, lecture recordings, etc.), because everybody organizes their site a little differently, and moreover, if you have new or transfer students, they might not be familiar with Canvas yet -- and this is something that is easier and quicker to just show than to describe in the syllabus document.

As for being in shock, I disagree and am very pro in-person. There is no reason why students and/or their parents are working so hard in an inflation-ridden society to pay thousands of dollars in tuition just to revert back to 2020 class experiences.

It's sad to see that the university is essentially forcing students to be exposed to covid with this current plan. Even if covid doesn't spread in classes, in-person classes force students to stay on campus and rely on other facilities(buses, dining halls) which facilitate spread.. .

Some reasons why I think this additional strain is not worth it:. . 1. Almost all students and the large majority of faculty and staff are already fully vaccinated, by mid-February, fully boosted. . 2. The risk of COVID transmission in classrooms seems to be very low. . 3. Almost all interactions between students and faculty and staff will be in classrooms, which, following point 2, makes transmission from students to potentially high-risk faculty and staff members unlikely.. . For these 3 reasons, I think it's safe to assume that not having mandatory weekly testing for all students will not put our faculty and staff in danger. An additional, and more simple reason why I think mandatory weekly testing is unnecessary is that:. . 4. If you don't experience any symptoms, it is highly likely that you don't have COVID. .

No matter what though there will always be someone to talk to if you put effort into it.. . Overall the academics are much more challenging, and students in general adapt more of a ""work hard play hard"" mentality. Profs and classmates are supportive and want you to really learn the material. . . I grew up in A2 my whole life. Downtown has a pretty good food scene and is moderately diverse. The city itself also often has events and festivals that anyone can join so it's fun! There's a LOT to do around the city (museums, parks, food, arcade, shopping). Umich also has events all the time and you can meet other people/ get free stuff.. . A2 is mostly liberal and the lgbtq scene is thriving - there's clubs (Necto in particular) dedicated organizations, etc. and it's a very friendly town. I think you would have zero problem fitting in.. . Overall I would definitely recommend transferring. I feel that my potential as a student and future employment has opened up tremendously.. .

I haven't seen any convincing, reputable data that school-induced spread is the same or worse than spread based on social vice. Do those data exist?. . 2) Testing in advance of arrival on campus would be ideal, but how could it be enforced?

Kept me from procrastinating if something wasn't due until Friday but I had scheduled three hours of working on it on Tuesday. . . 2. Pick and choose your battles. Someone posted something similar. I skipped a lot of busy work assignments (especially for language classes) and sometimes would limit myself to spending a certain amount of time on things. . 3. Get enough sleep. Everything else falls into place much better when you're well rested- you'll work faster, focus better, be happier, etc. . . 4. On a similar note, I never scheduled ANYTHING (classes, work, etc) before 10am. I'm a night owl, and I know if I go to bed at 2, I can still get 7ish hours of sleep and be in class at 10. This worked really well for me, I know some people who did the opposite and scheduled everything between 8am and noon and then we're committed to going to bed before midnight every night. . . 5. Find the jobs you can multitask at. I was a CCA in the dorms, usually I could take the night shift, and do homework with only getting interrupted once or twice. I also nannied a lot, which allowed me to do work while kids were sleeping, playing with friends, etc. . . 6. Be okay with not getting straight As.

t1_hrl6x5w,2022-01-07 03:28:52,t3_rxkgn3,t3_rxkgn3,"The January 4 ""[CDC Covid-19 Quarantine and Isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html)"" guidance has a relevant section titled ""Ending isolation for people who had COVID-19 and had symptoms"". The standard is not ""symptoms don't get worse"", it's ""symptoms have improved"" (besides loss of taste/smell), with a specific exception being any ongoing fever indicating you should continue isolation. ""You can end isolation after 5 full days if you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and your other symptoms have improved (Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation )."". . The section ""Ending isolation for people who were severely ill with COVID-19 or have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised)"" is more cautions, saying ""people with compromised immune systems might need to isolate at home longer. They may also require testing with a viral test to determine when they can be around others. CDC recommends an isolation period of at least 10 and up to 20 days for people who were severely ill with COVID-19 and for people with weakened immune systems. Consult with your healthcare provider about when you can resume being around other people."". . I think ""up to 20 days"" is the one recommendation in their Jan 4 guidance that's absolutely, unequivocally wrong. I don't know if they wrote their thought incorrectly, or the person who wrote it (or their boss) is an anti-science moron, or that was among the economist/politician-driven changes to 5 day isolation that the CDC has since said they're reconsidering, but the 20 day upper bound does not correspond to the relevant science. Most immunocompromised people are no longer contagious after 20 days, and perhaps that would be appropriate guidance for *slightly* immunosuppressed people, but people can be contagious for months, and that's why people who are immunocompromised should seek ""additional testing and consultation with \[an\] infectious disease specialist to determine the appropriate duration of isolation and precautions"", as described below.. . Here is an excerpt from the CDC's old interim guidance, from December 28, ""[Ending Isolation and Precautions for People with COVID-19: Interim Guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html)"", which seems well considered and unsullied by political influence:. . ""**For people who are severely ill or severely immunocompromised:**. . * A test-based strategy can be considered in consultation with infectious disease experts.. * Some people with severe illness (e.g., requiring hospitalization, intensive care, or ventilation support) may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending the duration of isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset.
. * Severely immunocompromised patients\* may produce replication-competent virus beyond 20 days and require additional testing and consultation with infectious disease specialist to determine the appropriate duration of isolation and precautions.. . \* For the purposes of this guidance, moderate to severely immunocompromising conditions include, but might not be limited to, those defined in the interim clinical considerations for people with moderate to severe immunocompromise due to a medical condition or receipt of immunosuppressive medications or treatments. ..."". . As an immunocompromised person with a possibly persistent infection (still shedding RNA), you may arguably be in the most dangerous class of Covid host, as the virus is undergoing more mutations the longer it replicates in you, and mutations that help overcome your limited immune response (i.e. immune system ""escape"" mutations) will be selected for survival and further replication. That's the leading theory on how Omicron developed, and based on the nearest matching ancestral variant, it seems that it could have been festering for six months or more. A fairly accessible article in *The New England Journal of Medicine* summarizes some of the studies on the mutations that occurred in individual immunosuppressed hosts with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections, including one case that lasted 152 days before the host died.^(1). . ^(1) Corey, L., Beyrer, C., Cohen, M.

There was a considerable number of students housed in Northwood III (myself included) for winter break when all other residence halls on campus closed. They probably need a few days at least to clean up the mess some of us left behind (I have never seen more trash around a dumpster as I did at Northwood right before school started), and (hopefully) properly disinfect everything around our apartments. Meanwhile, some of the places in Northwood III are straight-up un-liveable at this point, having been taken over by spiders, centipedes, stinkbugs, and god-knows-what during the past two years of vacancy and neglect. That's why I'm pretty certain that the numbers imply that only 33.3% of Northwood III is ready to accept students in quarantine.. .

They make it clear that their chart does \*not\* reflect positive test results from any other sources, and therefore does \*not\* paint a complete picture of cases in the university community. I am not even sure they include numbers from their UHS, i.e., all they show are completely asymptomatic people who got ""caught"" by the surveillance program. . From an external observer's perspective, my speculation is that people supplying data to the UM dashboard have been struggling combining the data ""streams"" from multiple sources. As I understand it, they periodically get data from the county and state on UM-affiliates that get tested outside of the university surveillance sampling, and they also get people self-reporting to OHS, for example. To combine these data into an ultimate number, they need to make sure they are not double-counting people whose diagnoses got reported by multiple sources -- given that different sources share their date at different times, in different formats, and containing different identifying info, this is likely not something they can do on a daily basis. . I think last year they were doing \~daily updates of CSTP data, and less frequent updates of external data that requires more time to ""clean.""

Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c, &c.When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.. . https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm",-1.0,error,0.0

Generally, they are taken for a more financially attainable and slower program. While this is good for some folks, especially if they are missing some things Michigan Assumes you know going in, the main problem is that, coming out of it, you might not know the content as rigorously as someone who's learnt it at Michigan. ( Depends on the course, but it's certainly possible depending on the program and teachers ). . If you really do want to take CC courses, I'd suggest taking the math courses at OU, if the transfer credits work out ( again not too familiar here, as I transferred slightly different classes ). The content is pretty decent, and the lecturers there are honestly great. . .

This is common misconception but not at all guaranteed and not how viruses or evolution works, esepcially in the short term. Mutation is a random act with any number of effects on characteristics, then spread through advantages gained in survivorship. It is fortunate luck that omicron does seem to be less severe even though it's more contagious with some overlap in the causes for that (like high rate of replication in the upper respiratory system rather than the lungs). But there is absolutely a possibillity that a more severe strain emerges with a similar or at least very high level of spread, especially if it evades immune response from vaccines or prior infections. The more Omicron spreads, the more it replicates, the more mutatations occur, the higher chance something even worse develops.. . There is a point that can be reached where a virus is *so* deadly it kills off its host before it can effectively spread. Or alternatively, everyone gets infected with a contagious and deadly virus, the virus kills off a massive number of the population, there's no one new to infect, and so only less deadly strains emerge. But we are a looong way off from reaching those points with Covid and we don't want to find out what it takes to get there.. . . >Our campus is next to a major hospita. .

The university is throwing caution to the wind by both not implementing effective procedures and by choosing to implement procedures that do not have the ability to be enforced or used properly. . .

The University should have hunkered down and continued to make the majority of classes be required to have recorded lectures, make testing mandatory for students, and be transparent about how the procedures in place are actually working. This would give people enough flexibility to work even if they get sick to prevent further spread, because we are back to having asymptomatic people coming into class and spreading the virus.

Privileges have responsibilities and requirements that come along with them. Attending the University of Michigan is a privilege. Nowhere in any constitution or law can you find anything that gives you the right to an education here. Then, Michigan is free to set conditions on attending this University. If Michigan chooses to mandate vaccination to make sure health services stay accessible through the community staying healthy, you're free to leave if this (sensible in my opinion) action goes against your beliefs.. . Michigan mandating vaccination to attend is as much them making a decision about your health as the grocery store not letting someone in without a mask is making a decision regarding their ability to move.. . Anyway, regardless of whether you feel that they have the right to do this or not, you really have to take a look at what you're saying. I get that you want people to stay out of your personal life, and I am sure they want to stay out of your's too. However, at some point, your personal decisions affect others in a way that harms them, and at that point, they are no longer personal freedoms. Your masking and vaccination status affect other people's health, and so the University mandates vaccines and masking. Please realize that not everyone is indifferent to becoming sick, even if it's mild.. . Finally, I understand you're frustrated that we have had three vaccinations and we still have to wear masks. I totally understand that, and it sucks. But the truth is that the Omicron variant of COVID has considerable immune escape, and although vaccinations are immensely helpful against symptoms, they do not help as much with infections. So please, mask up for a tiny bit more. I'm not saying to take every single precaution against COVID until the end of time, but you can track the spread of the new variant easily. It's important for healthcare availability that the don't all get sick at the exact same time, so please take precautions this first week or two.. . I trust you can make an informed decision. If you want to do some reading, here is a preprint discussing the lowered efficacy against infection: [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.21268565v1), and here is another study talking about the still high protection against hospitalization [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2119270).",28.0,error,0.0

People who have early morning sleep schedules can submit the homework earlier than the deadline. People who have work or class that runs into your 7pm deadline need to finish and submit the homework perhaps even a day early, or several hours before the deadline. Say you work until 7 or 8pm; you would have 4 hours to finish up work on an assignment traditionally, which is great, but if your shift starts at 12 and you had classes since the morning, you'll probably be up all night the day prior anyways trying to finish it up. You will have some students who can adjust and have excellent time management, but for most students who do begin assignments 1-3 days early, especially where they need to juggle other deadlines and assignments, this will be a 4 hour window that they could have used to do the assignment from their perspective. The one thing I do suggest setting an early deadline for is non-independent work, such as group projects, so members who must wake up earlier do not need to have 4 hours of sleep just because there was a midnight deadline the night prior. . .

The average on quizzes and exams was around 60% (so don't be shocked when grades come out... you aren't the only one - trust me).. . My main suggestion would be to use ALL of the resources offered to you AND some! (And I mean ALL of them!!!).. . Look into the SLC study groups/ tutoring options. They make a world of a difference. At least they did for me.. . Don't spend time reading the textbook- just find YouTube videos and do as many practice problems as you can.. . This class is all about problem solving so don't speed through mastering physics and practice exams. And DON'T start studying last minute as anything is fair game.

They don't want students using the personal LOA for a coop/internship, but it's supposed to basically be a no questions asked leave. I think their concern is that it could be related enough to your dissertation that it is considered making degree progress. To their credit in many cases it is (ie working on-site for an industry sponsor of your research), but I have had a few situations where students take a semester to do something substantially away from their dissertation research.. .

Then, I'd also reach out to your professors and explain the situation so they are aware and can help you out as well. Along with this, keep talking to your therapist about treatment!

The pro is that most people take eecs 280 as freshmen or sophomores. For many people this is one of the first hard class they've ever taken, and a lot of people I knew struggled a lot just putting in the consistent effort to avoid crunching on projects.. I firmly believe that college gets more difficult each year, especially in EE. I was finding the new hardest class I had ever taken basically up through the end of my graduate school courses. The bonus is that you're over leveled in a sense. If you're an EE and you've taken courses like 230, 320, or 216 yet, i think that even if you struggle to get into a CS headspace, you'll have the work habits to get you through. . The con is that 280 as a course believes that it's the only hard course on your plate, because it's targeting freshmen and sophomores. It'll throw a couple of projects that are way more work than they need to be to teach the concepts (cough euchre cough) because it's trying to teach you about debugging large systems, which you already have a sense for if you've been in EE lab courses. This will likely be annoying when you're trying to put out fires in other courses, and you suddenly need to work on a eecs 280 project. . .

I think people who haven't programmed before have an especially tough time in 101/183 because it's an entirely new way of thinking, but by the time you're in 280 you know a little bit more of what to expect and how to digest the information. I guess another way of putting this is that I think the learning curve flattens as you progress from 183 to 280 (and arguably from 280 to 281 as well).. . I'm going to echo what others have said and recommend that you lighten your load a little. 280 will NOT be fun if you're an RA and taking 18 credits. Find yourself a partner who you work well with, start the projects early, and always always always ask questions even if you're afraid of being embarrassed. . . I had DeOrio who isnt teaching 280 rn, but I would occasionally watch Juett's lectures and go to his OH. I can attest that he's really good at teaching and cares a lot about the students (as my questions should have worn his patience thin but they didn't lol).. . You're an EE student so you're definitely highly intelligent and know how to work hard, so I promise you you'll be okay if you just take it one step at a time. . .

They must be so embarrassed and ashamed. Now anyone who worked closely with schlissel (and it can't be a pool of that many people) is gonna get some serious side glances next Tuesday at the office if they're even willing to show up. Even the regents acknowledge it's not this persons fault by the fact that they fired Schlissel for exercising control over a subordinate in a relationship, but that didn't stop them from ruining this persons life by publishing 100+ pages of their private emails to a mob of students they had to know would absolutely eat this stuff up. I can't help but feel for this person right now.. . I don't imagine his family already knew about this, but even if they did, it can't be too pleasant for them either. I mean would you want to be one of this guys kids right now?. . It also feels like they needlessly sabotaged the university here with the timing and everything. You're telling me the regents were hard at work tonight around 8 PM when they suddenly stumbled upon this scandal? Last time I checked most people aren't up at work on Saturday nights. Of course that would be nothing new for them; they've put the university through plenty of embarrassment with their handling of previous sexual assault and harassment cases.
