I started at UofM, then took some time off and took classes at WCC (way more flexible and affordable) and then finished up at UofM. I would recommend doing 2 years at WCC, if you can get credits toward your major/degree the whole time, as it's way more affordable and chiller in general (but ultimately you should be where you feel best and work best, so if you feel you would work better at UofM, then transfer sooner rather than later!) . . Here's where you can check to see which classes transfer to LSA. I believe the CoE link is on the page too. https://transfercredit.ugadmiss.umich.edu/. . I would take only classes that transfer to UofM so that you have as many credits going into UofM as possible. Also try to get most of your distribution credits out of the way at WCC, that way you can focus on your major at UofM. Here are all the distribution requirements https://admissions.umich.edu/summary-lsa-degree-requirements. .

Make sure you really REALLY understand your definitions. The concepts of vectors, vector spaces, span, bases, should not be something you memorize. You should play with these definitions and think about as many examples as you can until those definitions become integrated into your vocabulary about vectors. Think about it as learning a language: you don't want to memorize the words, you want to really understand the essence of the words so that you can use them naturally.. . To be honest, many of the theorems/proofs in the class become significantly easier to digest if you really strive to understand the definitions of the concepts mentioned in the theorems. Many times they are not even necessarily saying something complicated, it's just that it's complicated to parse.. . After that, go through the homeworks. Part A should be second nature plug and chug. Perhaps it's not intuitive, but you should spend close to 0 time ""figuring out"" these questions, and some amount of time churning through the menial aspect of doing the work. They're work, but they should be close to guaranteed points on the exam.. . For part B, try and describe the general process of the proof. To prove something is a basis, you need to show linear independence and that it spans the space. To show linear independence, sometimes this is done through contradiction (ie a nontrivial relation would imply something weird), sometimes it is done by showing the coefficient of an arbitrary basis vector must be 0 (thus they ALL must be 0), and sometimes you might have to do something else. To show something spans, you take some arbitrary vector in your target space and try to construct the coefficients of your basis vectors that will allow the basis vectors to sum up to the arbitrary one. Sometimes this is just done through some algebra mashing and symbol pushing until it shows up. <- DONT underestimate the utility of arbitrary algebra bashing/symbol pushing.. . The hardest part to prep for is the true/false. Always have a few weird matrices handy and keep your examples SMALL (identity, all 0's, 1234 put inside a 2x2, all 0's except a 1 in the top left, all 0's except a 1 in the top right, etc). And always, always, try to think of degenerate cases. For example, is it possible to have a linearly dependent set of vectors with 1 vector in it? It's a good question to think about to illustrate the counterintuitive nature of degenerate cases.. . If you're going for an A, you'll have to do more than memorization. You probably won't get there without actually understanding the material.",13.0,error,0.0

I got rejected when I originally applied as a high school senior. I had good grades, experiences, and everything but my ACT was only a 27. Then I applied this year as a first-year sophomore (i started with like 15 credits because of AP and dual enrollment) to transfer and got rejected again. I also had a 4.0 and my experiences and essays were really good.. . I still want to apply again but I'm not sure if I should wait again to apply for fall 2021 or if I should apply for next winter. I feel like 1 semester of grades isn't gonna make me get in, but why not try?

The take away I had was the more you apply the more opportunities they have to accept you-- also, in case I was a little unclear the three terms aren't terms that you choose they are from the original application's term. So you really aren't hurting yourself by applying for that winter semester. My brother also transferred to Umich but as a sophomore in the winter term. Pretty much the only downside of coming in the winter is that they may have you stay on north campus if you are living in uni housing-- but even that isn't too bad because buses are free to students. . .

I was just at a presentation yesterday about what can be done (and what other schools have done) to both try and prevent things like this from happening and help students when it does. One of the takeaways was that a lot of weight is placed on filing formal grievances because it gives the university authority to open up more full investigations and take greater actions (especially in cases of tenured faculty).. . But that requires a great deal of trust from the student on so many levels. For starters they need to have someone they feel comfortable confiding in.

Waiting until the last minute is always a bad idea because of this right here (circumstances push you past the deadline), and it is just never a good look in general. Meeting and/or beating a deadline indicates that you are proactive and made this a priority.. . If the UROP fellowship is super competitive, then you will likely have to wait until the next round as there were other candidates who did submit their materials within the allowed time. If it's not, then you are likely okay and will be considered in the same way as the other candidates (it's not like they timestamp the apps).. . You are definitely not the first student who has ran into this sort of thing, and you won't be the last (you probably aren't even the only one who missed this specific deadline). It's a common teachable moment for college students. . . As someone who worked in one of the student services departments before, here's my advice:. . 1. Arrive there early, but not before the doors open (think 8:10-8-15ish). Give the people there a second to boot up their computers and get their coffee before making your mistake their problem.. . 2. Be apologetic, humble, and straightforward. Let them know that you thought the deadline was midnight and had been working, and is there any way you could submit it now. . . 3. Don't make excuses, don't be indignant. The common go-to for students is ""I'm too busy/this wasn't accommodating for me"" and that doesn't really go over well with people who have been in college before and are now working 40 weeks and balancing a family, a house, etc. It doesn't seem like it, but you have more free time now than you know (especially for getting anything done during business hours, as employed people are usually working then).

Throwing a tantrum won't get you any favors (not implying that you would, but I've seen it happen so I'm covering the bases). If they say no, it's likely because their hands are tied/the system won't allow new entries and it isn't really their decision. Plus, it isn't really fair to the students who did submit their materials on time. . . Good luck!

(I won't name him because it was literally his first semester teaching. also I just looked him up and he has a named professorship so I assume he has grown into the role.) The class was called object oriented design and was about data modeling and API design. The professor had a good idea for a class but it was just poorly implemented. . . The idea was that the class would divide into groups and each group would have an interrelated problem domain. Each group had to receive data from other groups, work with that data, and make their own data available to other groups. So each group had to define the data they needed and data they could output and also define an API for providing that data. Again, it sounds like a really neat idea. The problem was that the professor spent all of five minutes covering necessary topics and spent the rest of every class period talking about himself and all his great industry experience and generally shooting the breeze with students. He treated class as essentially office hours. On top of that, there was the ever present problem with group projects and free-riders. Here it was even worse because each group had to rely on other other groups. There were no interim goals or requirements that would have forced groups to make progress. The professor never contemplated that the groups would fail to work cooperatively with other groups or that some students (and entire groups) would not be self-motivated. In the end, things had broken down so much that actually getting data from other groups was abandoned. We had to assume that we were getting idealized data from the other groups. Overall, it was just a very untested plan for a class with too many assumptions about student behavior. . .

Getting an idea of what it's about and general idea of ""how it works"" is enough, I think; the foundations for getting more in-depth with it will be the thing(s) you wanna focus on.. . Umich doesn't usually approve transfer credit for their ""intro to CS"" courses (eecs 183 or engin 101), so you'll already be getting a solid intro to programming; you'll be learning C++, so maybe starting with something simple over the summer like some 'Intro to Python' stuff would be helpful. If you're already beyond these intro CS courses, then ""data structures and algorithms"" are what you wanna focus on next (and keep in mind that you'll be using C++).. . For me, the programming side of things was way easier than the stats side of things - and it's not too hard to do really well in those intro to CS courses (not to insult anyone). Stats, on the other hand, IMHO, starts out intense and stays intense the whole way through. If you're not really comfortable with calculus, review the shit out of it over the summer.. . Or better yet, take some calculus at Washtenaw Community College over the summer if you can swing it. Umich will accept the transfer credit for sure, the courses are way less of a nightmare there, and at the same time you arguably learn just as much if not more. As much as you can, use the summers to take WCC credits and transfer them over, I guarantee you won't regret it.. .

t1_finsazw,2020-02-24 18:32:57,t3_f8rpt2,t3_f8rpt2,"Tldr: not worth the extra money in terms of purely resources/doors opened. UT is comparable in almost every way EXCEPT scale of city, and the vibe of the student population.. . . I can give a little bit of advice as someone who had a similar experience. I grew up in Texas and got into both UT and UM, and ultimately picked UM(accepted to both music programs, added engineering as a second major, dropped music, added an art minor. Currently a 4th year student. I can only speak for those schools, not necessarily Ross). To tackle a few things you ask about:. . Quality of education - the quality of education you receive will be comparable in probably most ways. Michigan is technically higher ranked than UT in almost every department including business, but not a single person in Texas would be able to tell you that. But this difference is marginal(top 10 vs too 20 or sometimes even too 5 vs too 10), and when it comes to post graduation the school will have more of an impact on which region you will have an easier time finding a job. If you want a job in Michigan go to UM, same with Texas. Anywhere else and it will not matter very much outside the south/Midwest. (Class size matters when you get down to smaller numbers (50 people or less) but I can't comment on the business schools). . Tuition - Michigan is fucking expensive. Tuition will also increase at UM once you have hit your junior level of credits. Without scholarships ect my total is over 72,000 total. The education here is not worth 3X as much. I have other means of keeping that down like working for housing, a music scholarship, and my parents quite literally having nothing at the moment. But UM still favors in state over out of state in terms of financial aide. Again reiterating my first statement Ross will open up DIFFERENT doors than UT. Not necessarily better or worse. Both schools will have all of the same big businesses recruiting but UT will have more from Austin and UM will have more from the Midwest. But I doubt either school will open up ""better"" doors. It absolutely will not in any way open up more opportunities worth the difference in tuition. Do not believe that your chances of landing a good job are 3X higher, or higher at all going to Michigan.. . The vibe: Michigan and UT will have a considerable difference in a few ways, you mentioned the percentage of in state vs out of state, that is something genuinely wonderful about Michigan compared to Texas. I personally hated my Texas highschool, and wanted to get away from that style of people and I made the right choice. You will have a different atmosphere and vibe. In the engineering school (cannot comment on business) from what my friends have told me about UT, Michigan is a lot more chill and collaborative. We help each other out in office hours and don't feel like we are trying to beat our peers in most classes. I have heard UT is a little more competitive in engineering, and students don't seem to care about each other as much. The city vibe will also be very different. UT is literally integrated into a city of a million people, you will be living in that city. UM is integrated into a small City with more clear boundaries if on and off campus. The Ann Arbor us absolutely stunning and a big enough place to offer most everything. Greek life both professional and not are big here, but if that isn't your thing it's still a big enough school you can find almost any other crowd (im not a big Greek person but after my first year I was able to find my ppl). Now there is one big caveat to diversity at Michigan. It's that it isn't what it seems, the university cares more about it's image than it does it's students. The black population is less than half it was in the 90's and it's not much better for other minority groups. But UM markets itself as a haven for minority students. The president of our university arrested students and underage kids for peacefully protesting climate issues in campus. (I work in diversity equity and inclusion at our university, also the student body is incredibly vocal and activities about issues pertaining to our administration, so you will actually have wonderful experiences with student activism if you seek it out) Our campus is still diverse and beautiful, and the students and staff are incredible. Just know UM puts more money into marketing themselves as diverse than actually supporting it. please understand this mostly pertains to the highest up positions at UM. As a whole campus, the students and faculty care so much and advocate for our students. I wouldn't be surprised if UM is still far more diverse than UT. The students and professors here care a lot, and it's very apparent in the vibe of the campus. People are incredibly friendly here, and wonderful to work with.. . Why did I choose Michigan over UT.. I am here because I got accepted into the music school with scholarships to help pay for it. My plan was to either add a second degree or transfer, and I also wanted to get as far away from Texas as possible. The biggest of these three is that UT engineering is insanely hard to do a cross campus transfer into(UT had a 3.5-3.8 minimum GPA requirement while UM had a soft 3.0 requirement). And impossible to double major. UM is super super chill about doing dual degrees, and has lots of ways to collaborate with other majors. I've been able to add majors and minors and switch ect. Granted I'm going to be here a while, but it's a choice you have at UM. This is because UT has automatic admissions to their general school, so lots of people are going there hoping to transfer to specific schools, making it hard to do those types of things. Also I had money to come here to make it comparable to the price of UT for my first year or so. Being from Texas I've gotten used to the cold, if you can afford going here, go to bivuaoc in the fall and ask them to hook you up (shits expensive but they know they're stuff). Seasonal affectivness disorder is real (vitamen D deficiency from lack of sun can cause symptoms of depression that can compound with homesickness your first winter. It's a thing, keep it in mind, but it's definitely not a deal breaker for many people) I love this school and would choose it again, but it hasn't been easy.. . My suggestion: tour both schools. Ask them both about what they have to offer in terms of cross campus transfers (changing of major), adding majors and minors. Ask them about opportunities students like. And see the campus and get a feel for the size of the city. At the end of the day you are paying to grow as a person, not just to take classes. If you think you will thrive in a more diverse place like UM and in the city of Ann Arbor, maybe it's worth it. If you like Austin, and are sure about the program, then maybe that's the right choice. Maybe consider asking your parents to save some of that money for grad school and go to UT, and then come to Michigan post graduation. But definitely tour both campuses, reach out to students.",3.0,error,0.0

I like it now but my first year (sophomore year because I was a transfer) was really really difficult. Whatever you do, DO NOT CHOOSE THE NORTH CAMPUS DORMS. Absolutely not. Don't do it. Especially as someone who'll be traveling to central campus, try and find dorms down here. If you do end up on north, you'll have to take the bus in the morning, deal with angry wildlife (re: geese) and generally not see a soul for miles around. If you're a sociable person, that last one can really hit you hard. You're so isolated up there if you're not an engineering/stamps/music student so keep that in mind. Source: I lived there when I first transferred and my seasonal depression worsened so much I had to take a year off of school. I'm okay now though don't worry. . . Other than that, classes can be especially difficult if you're not used to doing busy work. What I mean by this is that in a lot of classes (I'm not sure about engineering/other but LSA definitely) your grade is essentially divided amongst many many parts. I came from a highschool that had final exams and that's it (don't ask. It was shit) and I struggled quite a bit with that. Just do every single assignment tbh. Also, as a freshman look into taking no more than four classes. Get some of your distribution requirements (first year writing, one semester of language etc) out of the way. I'd suggest taking the prereqs (ECON 101, 102 and MATH 115 is what the website says) but try to take at least one class that you're interested in otherwise. Essentially, diversify. Maybe you like writing--take ENGLISH 223. Maybe you like fairytales--COMPLIT 122 this semester is about world literature. Or, you really just like Econ in which case take the necessary classes. You should aim to get your prereqs for your Major out of the way before your sophomore year. This'll guarantee that you're on track to graduate on time and that'll definitely affect your overall happiness . . If you're someone who suffers from poor mental health, try to arrange something outside of the university. The university itself doesn't have great mental health resources and the therapists that are in Ann Arbor proper are exorbitant. . . Also, clubs. Don't make a commitment to more than two, but finding the right club for you will guarantee some really great friends. I met mine through my writing club here on campus! There's all sorts of clubs and you'll be able to find them at something called Festifall. Don't give your email out too readily, just take flyers lol. I signed up for a club that I didn't like in my sophomore year. I'm a senior now and I still get emails from College Democrats lmfao . . Finally, and this may sound like a joke, but join UMich Memes for Wolverteens, and Overheard at UMich on Facebook. They're hilarious and really make you feel like a part of the community! . . Sorry if this sounds super pessimistic but a lot of people feel like highschool is the hard part and once they get into college, it gets a little better. It does in some sense--you're surrounded by people who work hard and value education (for the most part) and you can have honest discussions with people about your academic passions--but you also have to work really, really hard. As long as you don't lose sight of that, you'll be okay. Not saying academics is everything, but at an academically challenging university like UofM, it's important that you keep your gpa up because it tends to seep into other parts of your life if you don't. . .

You're just being disingenuous and resorting to name-calling at this point. This entire conversation is about whether perspective pertains to the story presented in an account of events, or whether admitting to one's perspective is in and of itself an admission to bias.. . I never said Reuters or NPR aren't trustworthy. I don't know much about Reuters personally but I would argue that NPR is one of the best and most trustworthy institutions in American media. One of the reasons I say that is specifically because they're always careful to disclose their biggest contributors, especially ahead of stories that may pertain to them. And the reason they do so is because *they want the listener to know the perspective from which their reporting is told.* I trust NPR because I know that when they're reporting on something that they have a personal stake in, they *will* let me know so that I can evaluate the story as presented by other sources if I feel for any reason that their presentation of the facts was less than impartial.. . [You can read all about their independence and disclosure policy here](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/688405012/independence). Specifically, note this guideline:. . >#Guideline: When appropriate, disclose funding relationships in related reports.. . >NPR is fortunate to have hundreds of sponsors, funders and donors. At times, **NPR reports stories about corporations, organizations or individuals who support our programming**. As we outline throughout this handbook, we observe many boundaries to ensure that funding does not skew our coverage.. . >**We are scrupulous in disclosing funding relationships that might foster the perception that our supporters have influenced our work**. At the same time, a laundry list of disclosures would clutter our programs, rendering appropriate disclosures meaningless, so we avoid rote disclosures each time a supporter is mentioned in our coverage. **Whether or not to disclose a funder during the course of a particular story is a careful judgment made by editors and producers on a case-by-case basis**. As always, **we act carefully and thoughtfully to strengthen the public's confidence in the independence of our work**. For this reason, it's also important to note that NPR journalists do not read funding credits on-air or online.. . Is NPR inherently biased and untrustworthy on matters concerning their corporate sponsors? I don't know, that's up to the individual to decide based on their own trust relationship with NPR. I know that I generally trust them not to lie to me, but I still understand the reason why they're so insistent upon disclosing [every source of funding they've ever had](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances). You can see an exhaustive list of their corporate sponsors on [page 21 of this PDF [labelled 40 on the page]](https://www.npr.org/documents/about/annualreports/2018_Annual_Report.pdf). All of this is done specifically because NPR knows it is not an impartial observer of truth, isolated completely from worldly interests such as money or PR. Disclosures are very similar to endorsements in the sense that they are designed to say ""this is the general economic ecosystem in which our reporting is done. If for some reason you have a beef with USPS and don't trust any institution that takes money from them, know that they are one of our sponsors and that you may want to consider getting a second opinion."" Endorsements are the exact same, as they say ""this is the general *ideological* ecosystem in which our reporting is done.

t1_fit4ija,2020-02-26 08:01:44,t3_f9l9q2,t3_f9l9q2,"There are two kinds of office hours in EECS:. . 1. Office hours for programming classes, which generally use a queue based system where students are usually served one-at-a-time in a public space where they can work independently while waiting, such as a CAEN lab.. . 2. Office hours for theory classes, which are more like the nightmares described in the article where ""they literally go across the entire basement and take all these chairs just to sit around this one guy with a tiny whiteboard"" like in the article.. . Both have their problems, but (2) is the only one that truly affects people outside of the major, at least in theory.. . My main gripe with (1) is that the queueing systems aren't quite well designed enough that you can viably wait your turn elsewhere if the public space is getting too crowded, say on another floor or in another building. You're not notified in any way until it's your turn that your turn is coming up, and there's no way to gauge if you're gonna be helped in five minutes or fifty minutes regardless of how many people are in line. You could be next in line for an hour, or they could drop ten people from the queue out of nowhere because they all dipped or figured out their problem and forgot to leave the queue. But this is all a design problem - there's no reason you couldn't design a system that kicks people if they don't check in to maintain their queue position every 15 minutes or so, which would prevent the need to camp out at a CAEN computer you're not using. There's no reason you couldn't integrate Piazza somehow with the problem descriptions you provide when claiming your place in line, which would encourage a ""search first"" practice and keep lower-priority / common troubleshooting issues from wasting GSI time. I see no reason why this format can't be optimized to be less of a nuisance to CS students and non-CS students alike.. . (2), on the other hand, is just a fundamental misuse of resources and poor planning. Every theory class I took in CS - 203, 376, etc. - had an absolutely useless lab component in which GSIs would simply give the same lecture that the professor gave, except maybe more focused on a single topic or abridged. They were never required, rarely useful or attended, and were generally only helpful in the last ten or so minutes left after the GSI finished their redudant mini-lecture in which they would basically hold extra office hours. Oftentimes people would only ever go to 376 lab if they needed office hours help on their homework and couldn't make it to the actual office hours that week. In my opinion, classes like 376 should either scrap lab components entirely, or use labs exclusively as dedicated office hours time. This will never happen because labs allow them to artificially reduce class capacities, but as it stands, 376 labs only really serve to clog up room schedules and waste time. If they got rid of the lab component, it would give GSIs more time to hold office hours, which reduces the chances that half the class can only make it to the one evening office hours held in the UGLi. If they used the lab time they currently have as office hours, it would provide a nice built-in isolated space where CS students can get office hours without monopolizing the library. Either way, there's absolutely no excuse as to why things have to be this way where dozens of 376 students are effectively forced to crowd around a single tiny white board in the basement of the UGLi every Thursday at 9pm because their GSI spent this week's lab reviewing the lecture material which should have been recorded with slides posted anyway.

U-M doesn't have enough money to do it all. Every thing an institution does has an opportunity cost--for everything it invests in, there's something else (or many something elses) it can't invest in. So it's making choices, all the time, trying to balance priorities. That's why you may see incremental changes in areas where you think big changes are warranted. It's because UM has to think about CS students AND Ross students AND SMTD students AND students with disabilities AND (you get the point). . . You might think UM's priorities aren't very well aligned with yours (or students in general) and you'd like it to invest in different areas. Fair criticism for sure. But with context, you might see that it's a different issue than UM just refusing to invest in anything or making anything better.. . Also, there seems to be a perception that UM has some impressive pile of money lying around waiting to be spent (if it weren't for UM being so stubborn/cheap/etc). That's not quite right either. The endowment is massive, but when we state its value we're talking about the principal, or corpus, which is literally never meant to be spent. It's meant to be invested to throw off interest which UM *can* spend. Sometimes UM can spend it on whatever it wants, but a lot of it has strings on it. If Scrooge McDuck gave UM $10M to endow a fund for duck research, UM has to spend that interest on ducks. It can't spend it on other needs, no matter how compelling they are. . . Finally, all this stuff takes time. If Scrooge McDuck gave $500M for CS tomorrow, it would still take 3 years to plan and build a building. It could take a year to hire faculty (people don't generally pick up and move mid-year).

I don't think I can speak for everyone here, but my roommate is also in LSA Humanities and is surprised with how frequently I go to office hours. I think there must be some correlation with the design of lecture slodes. The content seems like a slide that explains some code that's useful for projects, but the bulk of lecture seems to be exam content that's not very relevant for projects or lacking in sufficient examples for homework. From what I've seen, students will sort of stop going to lecture until the weekend before midterms/finals and just spam them at double speed since the slides seem like lecture material (my lecture went from 150ish to <15 this semester). . . I think I had something else I wanted to add, but I accidentally deleted. Will edit if I remember :P. . Addionally, sometimes it just feels like *too much* for one course. I can recall a few times where a new lecturer/professor would have to present slides made by the previous staff, and they'd remorsefully say something along the lines of ""Where I used to teach, this used to be split up into an entire course... but I guess here we're doing it in two weeks/lectures/etc"".. .

You can watch someone swim all day, take notes on the proper technique, but you won't really understand how to do it until you're thrown in the water yourself. So you kind of learn how to code ""on the job"" so to speak. The point of zybooks, labs, and projects is to get you to fumble with code until it starts to make sense. In my opinion, you're supposed to be stumped at times, to give you time to think and look at things from a different perspective. . . I took the class with no prior programming knowledge, as did many people I know. I honestly thought the staff and lectures taught me a lot. Again, not trying to invalidate your experience, and things have probably changed. But I do want to say this: i have seen students basically beg for handouts and answers to a problem for projects. This is not unique to 183. This has happened in literally every eecs class I have taken. As soon as they come across something they don't immediately know how to do, they go to office hours, ask the professor/IA to do the project for them, and then trash the department/class because they won't do it. Projects are supposed to be challenging, and the whole point of them is that you learn something from doing them.. . I'm not saying that people shouldn't go to office hours or ask for help. They're there for a reason, and very beneficial to the student. But you wouldn't go to office hours for a math class and ask for the answer. You would ask for advice as to how to approach the problem. However, in programming (and CS), sometimes the problem IS how to approach solving the problem, so the instructors can't simply give out the answer.",8.0,negative,0.52176433801651

It can definitely ask a lot of you, and I understand that it can be really stressful. I took the course with prior programming knowledge and sometimes I still felt really stumped on the projects.. . Do you go to lab? Sometimes I feel like interacting with an IA/GSI one on one can be more helpful for conceptual issues with the projects than office hours, since office hours tend to have long wait times as there's a lot of people needing help. I do genuinely believe that the class offers all the resources you need to succeed, but it's always up to you to take advantage of them. If you're not starting early, you gotta start early. If you're struggling with the concepts, don't wait until you're getting burned on a project, schedule a tutoring session ASAP (offered by course staff/vetted tutors and 100% free!). . . Lastly, I do want to say that I'm sorry you had a bad experience with staff but please remember that staff (in 183 and in all courses) are human too.

As you allude to below, the LSA process is certainly more responsive in terms of total time elapsed, but in my experience, it fails to impart the desired learning and reflection which is the cornerstone of the CoE process. Investigating each allegation and meeting with each student in front of the full council takes time.

That post you mentioned has kinda become legendary in the ICC and while it's definitely accurate in a broad sense, I think it overstates how crazy each house is (although it's possible I'm just desensitized after living in the coops for so long..). Keep in mind that a house is only as good as the people who live in it and the nature of college houses is that things change very quickly.. . Disclaimer: I lived in Luther and loved it, so I'm definitely biased towards them and my main criteria for judging coops in based on more social considerations. Your milage may vary depending on what you're looking for in a home.. . . . . Baker: Live here if you're older and/or a graduate student. More expensive than others, but you're guaranteed to get your own space (all the rooms are singles by default). Very smart, very interesting people live in Baker, the lack of undergrads really affects the culture. When they set their minds to it, they can still get wild, but it's definitely more subdued than the undergrad houses.. . Black Elk: Super non-conformist; talking to people from Black Elk was always a treat because they're just so different from most people. I don't mean that to be patronizing, I genuinely really enjoyed spending time there. People there generally don't really like to party; famously, they always sign up for the first slot of south campus progressives (parties where you visit all the coops on south campus one by one) so they can get everyone out of their house by 9:30. Strong LGBT+ culture. . . Debs: I never spent much time at Debs, so I don't feel strongly about them one way or another. Average, mid sized coop.. . . Esher: Do yourself a favor and don't live on north campus unless you're an engineering student. I am liberal arts scum, so literally the only time I ever went to north campus was to go the NCRB if the CCRB was closed. As such, I have no impression of Esher other than that it's big and less intimate than the other coops. More of an apartment complex than a house.. . . Gregory: There was always a lot of drama at Gregory during the time I was in the ICC. It's the only sober house, so if that's important to you, I would check it out, otherwise, I think looking at other houses would be wise.. . King: King has turned into something approaching the retirement house of the ICC. A lot of ICC people who aren't ready to give on coop life altogether but still want something a little more low key seem to end up here. It's a closer to an apartment complex than a bonafide coop and my understanding is that there's not a lot of interaction between the various apartments, but it still beats living in the real world.. . Lester: The most wholesome coop, imo. A bit on the smaller side but with a very kind, tight knit community.. . Linder: Kind of like Baker, but for younger people. I was always very impressed with the people who live here. Very strong, insular culture. Tends to not have very much turnover as a result. Unless you sign up in like September, you will most likely not get a spot.. . Luther: My love. Big house, big fun. In the past, it's had the reputation of being the most fratty of the houses, and that might still be the case, but imo, house culture has improved dramatically from the time I moved in. It's comprised of two houses on one big property. Luther is a house ruled by contradictions; they spend a lot of time and money throwing huge parties in 1520 (the larger house), then when the party starts, all the Lutherites crowd into 1510 (the smaller house) so they don't have to talk to strangers. Weekend porch drinks are always a blast.. . MichMinnies: Formerly two houses, MichMinnies recently consolidated into one house, with a similar setup to Luther. Located in Kerrytown, which means everything's a lot more dense and less anarchic than the south campus coops. The people who live there are cooler than you and they know it.. . Nakamura: I've definitely spent more time here than Debs, but I'd lump it in with them in that I can't really say they have a very distinct culture one way or another. They do open mics every other week that are always fun to go to and they have a really great location, especially to get late night BtB or Mr. Spots. That location is a bit of a double edged sword though; avoid if you have bad impulse control. I think if I lived there I'd eat out like every night lol.. . Osterweil: Does anyone actually live here? I'm not sure.. . Owen: If you've ever wanted to go to a band show with 0 people in the crowd, this is the coop for you. In all seriousness, Owen is a really cool house. They host live music probably the most of any house, and it doesn't tend to get as out of hand as, say, Lutherween.

For context, I'm a history major, not history of art -- anyone can take on this minor, regardless of interest. It does veer towards humanities studies, but even a bio major with an interest in working at an aquarium would get a lot out of it. . . The program's structure is very straightforward:. . * Museums 301 (3 credits): Intro. ONLY offered in the fall. Must have sophomore+ standing.. * I recommend this class to anyone interested in education or non-profits. Easy lectures with a final project that is challenging but genuinely engaging and related to the material.. * Museums 401 (3 credits): Follow-up to 301. ONLY offered in the winter.. * 3 electives (3-4 credits each). MS sends out an email around backpacking to all declared MS students with a list of non-MS department classes that will count towards the minor. There's anthro, history, philosophy, etc, and it changes every semester. . * Museums 409: internship (3 credits). To my knowledge, the MS minor is the only program at U-M which *requires* students to complete an internship. Having real-world experience is essential to deciding where you want to go in the museums field, so I really appreciated being pushed to find something in my undergrad. Some quick tips:. * The internship can be paid, although it's okay if you are unpaid or a volunteer. Many MS minors [work at the U-M Museum of Natural History](https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh/u-m-community/undergraduate-students/student-docents.html) (the museum inside the BSB, on North U. They hire every fall). To be clear, it is the museum that would pay you, not the MS department.. * Usually the internship should last about four months, or one semester, but they're a pretty flexible department. Every professor I've had who is associated with MS is friendly and loves talking about their work in the field.. * The MS department sends out opportunities *all the time.* At least three times a week, I get applications forwarded to me for both US and international opportunities.. . If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I'd also recommend getting in touch with them at [MuseumsMinor@umich.edu](mailto:MuseumsMinor@umich.edu).",1.0,error,0.0

I knew I wanted to work in the aerospace industry from all the time playing Kerbal Space Program and other space games. I'm graduating in May with a BSE in Aero and will be continuing my studies as a Masters student in the fall in Space Engineering. I've interned with a major aerospace company every summer since my Sophomore year working different air and space platforms. At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter what your major is if you plan to work in the aerospace industry. Most professionals I've spoken to said they really only look for smart engineers; my program director last summer majored in Ceramics Engineering when he started out. Sure, if you plan to be an aerodynamicist maybe an aerospace degree would look better on your resume but there's not that much difference between an aerospace and mechanical engineering degree. I recall considering mechanical briefly but I really wanted that aerospace title. Honestly, we learn pretty much the same stuff just with a flying or orbiting perspective. We do cover more fluids content though. I'd say the biggest difference in Michigan is how the two disciplines approach problems. In Aero, a lot of our thinking is focused on the system as a whole. We consider how certain design decisions affect other subsystems and how every aerospace product involves some kind of optimization trade between subsystems. We also use a lot of matlab because for some reason the professors love that shit. I will point out that the aerospace degree requirements are very rigid compared to mechanical. They've slowly gotten better at broadening your choices but you'll be taking roughly 90% of the same classes as rest of your aero colleagues in the same credit level. We are a smaller college; it's a little more closely knit since you'll recognize people in your classes more frequently than mechanical. From what I understand from my friends in mechanical, they take a wider variety of classes and have more choice in upper levels. If you feel really strongly about aerospace you should go for it. Most people in aerospace have a passion for it and while it's hard, we all chug along together geeking out at the same aerospace stuff and laboring through the difficult classes and professors. If you were to go mechanical to be more broad, it wouldn't be difficult to get an aerospace job with a mechanical degree. There's a ton of mechanical engineers that get hired from other schools solely because they don't have aerospace undergrad programs there. Several of my mechanical friends have gotten full time jobs in aerospace with little to no aerospace background. Same applies in the opposite case, an aerospace engineer can do something outside of aerospace if they choose to; I've met an aerospace engineer who graduated UM and went to work for Cummins in a more mechanical role. . . So the TLDR version: it doesn't matter that much. You won't close any doors if you pick aero over mechanical and vice versa.

I live in Northwood IV and honestly I kind of love it. I have a 2-bedroom with AC, basement, washer/dryer and internet/utilities all for $1266 - honestly, this is the cheapest you will get in Ann Arbor. It's quiet and dead here for sure, but it's super easy to get to central campus. Like others said, there are groceries within walking distance, and you're close to a few nice wooded areas. Whole Foods is a short car ride too. I see zip cars here if you don't have a vehicle of your own. In terms of apartment quality, it really depends on the unit. Mine is very sunny and warm - it faces East and West (I know, weird) and it's very light-filled. Also, my apartment is always very toasty - heat is included so I keep my place at 70 in the daytime and 68 at night. I also can't stress how nice it is to have a 2-bedroom. We have many friends/family come through and it's been incredible to be able to provide them with their own room (was not the case in our tiny Oakland apartment). One other thing to mention - although the units are old and decrepit, there is a maintenance team that is super responsive, so if something does break you have them to help you out. . . Some drawbacks are: the walls are thin, so you might hear your neighbors; it's a total bubble and doesn't feel lively (which is why I always bus to central to party), you can't walk to all the bars downtown. . .

It said something like, ""Michigan voter registration form"". I took the form and showed the guy at the window my out-of-state drivers license and a copy of my most recent DTE bill. That was all I needed! I brought my social security card and lease and student ID as well and he said the DTE bill was enough. Boom, registered to vote in MI.. . Then he gave me a form to fill out to get an absentee ballot (to vote early instead of at my polling location on Tuesday). I say ""form"" but it was like check 3 boxes and sign and date. Then he gave me my ballot and I took it over to the corner where the privacy booths were and filled it out. Dropped it back off near the front and grabbed my ""I voted in Ann Arbor"" sticker. Boom, done voting. Whole thing took ~30 mins including parking. If you're on campus today and have some spare time, go vote early!

I learn most of the things I need by myself and I also need to learn what are the things I need to know . This is usually where your advisor comes in handy, sometimes they can save you some time so you don't go down a rabbit hole. Sometimes, they unknowingly push you down a rabbit hole.. . As for comparison, research-wise, I wrote a thesis when I was an undergrad at UofM, I have a second major from LSA but that research experience was very well-guided and in charted territories compared to this PhD. Course-wise, I think its easier to maintain a really good GPA in grad school and part of that is probably because you usually only take 2 courses a semester (or grad courses curve more generously?). There is this ""nobody cares about your GPA, your papers are what will get you your PhD"" mentality in grad school although secretly everyone cares about their GPA. Courses workload is more or less the same as undergrad but courses tend to have a ""term project"" component where you can basically do anything that interests you or apply what you've learnt to your research area so you can potentially get a paper. I think UofM courses prepared me well in terms of intensity - I've had some challenging course projects in grad school and I usually go head on thinking ""I survived CS at UofM I can survive this too"". . . I totally get you - I had 18 credits my final semester there with deadlines left and right but hang tight! UofM CS has a really good reputation, it's all worth it :)",2.0,positive,0.9052450656890869

t1_fk61kvz,2020-03-11 01:57:53,t3_fg81te,t3_fg81te,"Hi! I was a third-year / junior by credits transfer for Summer '19 from a university in California, although I grew up in state so I'm pretty familiar with Michigan.. . 1. Transition was MUCH less painless than I expected. I transferred in the summer which gave me time to explore campus and manage just one class, but I don't think Fall term should be much more intense. At orientation they do a great job of explaining what you should take in terms of classes, but you might get stuck with some shitty class times your first semester. I would suggest taking less than 15 units your first term to get a feel for things. All 60 units I transferred counted as electives, and didn't fulfill requirements or pre-reqs. Definitely a huge difference in expectations in work that required serious (but completely achievable) adjustment on my part. Friends weren't hard to make at all. Everyone is extremely friendly, and most lectures have smaller discussion classes that help you meet people more easily! I'd expect to meet mostly freshman in GE lectures, but there are more than plenty of transfers too. Typical ways to find friends other than class is clubs, orgs, explore what you're interested in because there's so many opportunities. Transfer Connections was also useful at the beginning of my Fall semester, but I don't attend much now.. 2. An important thing to note - lots of LSA classes / LSA building are not near the Ross building, so housing prices and availability will be different at either location . Rent at high-rises is definitely more expensive than what you're paying, I'd say close to twice as much (or more) for a 2-bedroom. The upsides are on-call staff / security and amenities like gyms and pools, depending on where you may choose to live. However, if this is too expensive, try [offcampushousing.umich.edu](https://offcampushousing.umich.edu) for places / google ""off campus housing umich."" There are plenty of great and less expensive choices available. I wouldn't recommend living on North Campus, although the bus system is great, because of LSA / Ross class locations. Keep in mind FAFSA may cover some of off-campus housing costs.. 3. I currently live with a friend I knew prior to coming to UMich, but I don't think it would have mattered if had I lived alone, which I'll be doing in the next term. Unfortunately, a high-rise studio is going to be far more than your 2-bedroom. . 4. Personally not in Greek life, and I would say as an upperclassman, it's definitely not as influential as it was when I was an underclassmen at my old university, or to current underclassmen here. You can check out your frat and meet some people and see if it's similar to what you're used to, since chapters tend to vary a lot from school to school.. 5. I completed a scholarship profile on Wolverine Access but never received anything, I'm afraid I'm not much help in this department. I will say my GPA was 3.85 in a similar LSA major, and did not receive anything regarding academic achievement scholarships.. 6. Get the UMich app! The UMich app has the nearest dining locations to you and the bus schedule and routes, which is super easy to figure out. You'll do quite a few online modules on Canvas before registering for classes that have a lot of useful information. For navigating campus, it definitely just becomes easier the more you walk around and explore, and I definitely use Google Maps a ton. They also take you on a brief tour during orientation that's helpful. I never went to the library before transferring, but the libraries here are fantastic. Use maizepages to look at extracurriculars you may be interested in ahead of time! Also, I was unaware until I began classes that all classes end 10 minutes earlier than their listed time, to give you time to get to your next class. . .

The source you use for proper mask application/removal is also valuable, but I'm afraid that even with proper education, many will not remove their masks properly, touching the surface and essentially negating the mask's purpose. . .

The amount we still don't know about this virus is staggering, and limited testing (so you can't even know who has it) doesn't help at all.. . That aside, I don't think contigency planning usually extends down into the realm of the faculty and other instructional staff. I don't think that's a UM thing, that's true all over. Faculty usually have their hands full just doing the normal work of teaching, advising, mentoring, planning curriculum, doing research, staying abreast of developments in their field, etc. I can't imagine there it's common, anywhere, to tell faculty ""for every course you develop, please also develop some alternatives to how you'd deliver this if we had a global pandemic."" How many would comply? Especially for the ones where it's really hard to take them online? I don't blame faculty who may have crossed their fingers and hope it never happens.

Hard to imagine any amount of encouragement would have got them to plan for remote learning when all of this was just hypothetical. . .

CRLT has resources, Academic Innovation has resources. There's lots of lecture capture technology on campus, and tons of stuff online. . .

President Schlissel notes, ""all students are encouraged to leave campus and return to their home residences."" All instruction and assessment will be conducted remotely, and it is my expectation that faculty will modify expectations commensurate with this new way of working. As students confirm plans, they should complete the [survey here](https://forms.gle/3pwhmKXJLvstwEim6) to indicate if they are staying on campus or returning home.. . For students who choose to remain on campus, U-M housing and dining operations, the University Health Service, and libraries will remain open to serve students who stay. We continue to urge everyone to practice social distancing of 5 to 6 feet when you are engaging with others.. . 1. **Stamps studios will be open with limited capacity and limited hours.**. . It is our expectation that students will depart campus and use of these facilities will be minimal and short-term. Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Professor Brad Smith will be in touch with updates about the changes in studio access very soon. Classrooms will be locked.. . 1. **Change to A&A building hours.**. . Effective Monday, 3/16 and until further notice, the A&A building (including the Senior Studios) will be open 7 am-10 pm Monday-Friday and 7am-7pm Saturdays and Sundays with keycard access only. You will need your umich ID to enter the building at all times; you will not be able to get into the building outside of the hours noted above.. . 1. **Stamps Gallery hours reduction.**. . From March 17 and until further notice, Stamps Gallery hours of operation are: Tuesday to Saturday 1pm to 5pm.. . 1. **A&A Building Staffing**. . We anticipate that staffing levels will be greatly reduced as most staff transition to working remotely. The main office will remain open. . . 1. **The 2020 Stamps Senior Exhibition -- Canceled** . While we previously announced that the 2020 Stamps Senior Exhibition would move forward, with only the opening reception canceled, the scale of disruption caused by current circumstances now regrettably require that we cancel the exhibition entirely -- including the screening and performances. We are very disappointed that we are not able to publicly recognize the achievements of our graduates through the exhibition but we are exploring ways to showcase Stamps Senior work online and will provide more details at a future date.. 2. I am deeply saddened to announce that commencement on 5/2 is canceled. We will be in touch at a later date with information on how we can celebrate and honor the class of 2020 -- and the incredible work they will continue to create remotely throughout the remainder of the Winter 2020 term.. .

Are the conditions required for testing in Michigan published online (I know they are heavily location/time dependent, so not really expecting anything definitive). The best resource I could find is [this](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/HAN00429.asp).. . Secondly, my personal situation. I returned from spring break Sunday night, during which I spent significant time in the Denver area. I started to develop mild congestion on Wednesday, and have remained mildly congested. The most recent cdc guidance I have seen suggests that I self-monitor but go about life as usual; this may be outdated. Where can I find resources instructing me at what point to contact a healthcare professional and/or pursue testing? My current plan is to self-isolate as much as possible, and to avoid the healthcare system and testing unless my condition worsens a great deal. I am not very concerned about my prognosis since I live by myself and am 23 and am in good health and am relatively fit (and, of course, it is very likely that I just have a cold or seasonal allergies).",14.0,negative,0.5737375617027283

In your case with full tuition scholarship and a guaranteed research job, I would say that Michigan State is clearly the better option for you. They're both the same size university, and while MSU has a more robust social scene, there's room for all types of lifestyles at both. I have no doubt that you'll do well at Michigan, but it is generally a harder school and if you want to do research there's a good chance you'll be doing unpaid volunteering or having to go through UROP for a while before you can really get the ball rolling. Basically, don't led pride mislead you and discredit MSU as a quality university - it is a very good university and unless you do absolutely nothing in your undergrad then it won't prevent you from getting to med school (if that what you stick with all 4 years).

Also, I'm not sure how experienced you are in health, so I've decided to go out on some tangents.. . Your title is a bit ambiguous as I'm unsure if you're looking to maintain your current body shape or just maintain your body shape (getting it to a healthy state by either gaining or losing weight). So I'll just unload a ton of information. . . Firstly, I'll start with the food side of things. As food is just as integral as exercise.. . From experience, don't fall into fad diets (cutting carbs, or cutting fats, or cutting X out of your diet). Your body is a machine and needs essential nutrients to maintain itself and produce other nutrients. So, fad diets can render you deficient in these nutrients (and eventually lead to diseases too). Along with this fact, they're major changes to your eating habits, which means you'll most likely give up.. . I suggest counting calories because you'll need all the current foods you eat to obtain all your nutrients. Generally, just eat what you'd normally eat but in smaller portions. If you're anything like me, I didn't really like counting calories because it seemed so tedious. And it can be. For most days I just estimate the amount of calories I've eaten. Though, if you actually want results, you should definitely count calories down to the can. Download an app perhaps. I've done it before and it works. . . However, (if you're trying to lose weight) don't get tempted to set your daily calorie limit so low in an expectation to see fast results. Your body needs nutrients just as much as it needs energy (calories). The more extreme changes you make to your eating habits, the more likely you are to stop. So try to set it to a reasonable deficit or (if you're trying to gain weight) positive intake. Also, look up the average calories a person of your demographic requires per day. I'm sure there's tables that factor in BMI, sex, and age to find an average. I'd set it a few hundred calories less than this average if you're trying to lose weight or a few hundred more if you're trying to gain weight.. . Also I'd recommend you eat more fat and nutrient-dense foods if you're trying to do a calorie deficit. Fat provides a feeling of satiety and nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of calorie-dense foods (empty calories). . . Now to the exercise.. . I'm not as experienced when it comes to the exercise part, but make sure to stress your muscles when doing any activity. Planking and doing push-ups are pretty good ways to build muscle (along with them being able to be done anywhere). The more muscle you have, the more energy you burn. I'm not sure if you're trying to lose weight, gain weight, or literally maintain weight, but if you want to lose weight, keep your calorie deficit.. . Sorry as to how short the exercise part is. If you're trying to lose weight you have most of your information; you could really just count calories and do some light activity for about 30 minutes a day or so. I forget the recommended weekly exercise minimums but oh well.. . If you are literally just trying to maintain your weight, zero change in weight, just keep doing what you're doing in terms of diet and maintain your muscle mass. Though, it would definitely be a problem if you're like a heavy lifting champion and no longer attend the gym... that would mean all of this information is garbage.. . Uh, I just hope you're trying to lose weight since that's where I'm most helpful. What exactly are you trying to do?. . Exercise/maintain body shape could mean a lot to me, so I hope you'll reply with clarification and feedback.. . If you have the chance to ever talk to a nutritionist, I'd suggest you do. He/she could provide you with so much more insight than I could.",3.0,error,0.0

It is difficult for each path in their own right. For context, I will be attending a Top 20 medical school next year, and in the FB group we are in, there are at least 10-20 other UM grads in there, and only 1 MSU grad. I think objectively you will find more UM grads at top tier institutions than MSU grads. However, it definitely is possible for MSU grads to do really well with med school admissions. I did meet a MSU grad at a Top 10 medical school that I interviewed at. But I think objectively UM grads tend to do better with medical school admissions. . . The tricky part of that is that it is really difficult to do well at UM relative to MSU. I think with having so many motivated students at UM, it can be a bit daunting. I don't have an exact percentage, but a fair number of kids come into UM thinking pre-med only to change their mind within a year or two due to the course work. It is challenging, I will say that upfront. . . Either way, my point is that you can find success in either route, but there will be obstacles in either regard, so trust your gut.

I am not sure what other kinds of ""take action"" scenario you are envisioning. As bright, activist, savvy students, you should do what you must.. . \*HOWEVER\* please understand the complexities of the issues that the University is working through. This University, and all universities.. . Refunds and discounts can get complicated when a university has awarded federal financial aid. The department of education has yet to establish guidelines on what colleges should do about it. Right now, the university doesn't have enough information to know what it can or can't do. Once the DoE issues any guidance, there are still gonna be some decisions that the U has to make. What's fair, what's equitable, what is feasible? A policy that helps one group may be hard on another. They gotta hash all that out.. . A huge priority is trying to make sure academic courses continue well enough that most students can legitimately earn all the credits they registered for, so they stay on track and aren't derailed and are prepared for what comes next, whether that's next term or life after college. It may be no big deal for some students to call it quits, grab a refund, and have a do-over, but what if you're on your last term of aid eligibility? What if you were planning to take a licensure exam soon and you need that material to pass? So a high priority is figuring out how to teach remotely. How to reconfigure exams. How to teach material that is almost never taught in any way except face-to-face. How to solve new problems that are just arising now that we are starting our first week of course-delivery like this. This continues to be top priority for the University.. . In addition to the uncertainty described above, and all the time-absorbing issues related to these changes, the University is still working on issues like getting students home if they are abroad, not just back to the country but back somewhere (home, somewhere else, etc) once they get back here. Some students are on U-M programs and some students are on other school's programs. Some programs will try to continue remotely, some can't. Some of these individual situations are complicated, staff are spending time sorting them out. These are urgent matters that need attention above others.. . So yes, you might be able to make a strong case that your education after 3/11/2020 is less than you thought you were getting when you enrolled this term, and the University should set a new price and refund some of your money. But be realistic about the response you will get to that when there are so many issues ongoing, plus the ongoing concern that there are going to be more life safety issues to deal with if cases mount within the UM community. At the very least, be realistic about how quickly you are going to hear back on that.. . \*\* Short version: U-M (or whatever university you go to) may not be giving you answers now on how much of your money you'll ""get back"" for your diminished experience. But it's not because people are sitting around trying to figure out how to screw you, and it's not because they aren't aware that students have questions. \*\*",3.0,error,0.0

I realize that at first they seemed more accommodating about people staying in the dorms, but I also think that at that point, they probably had more hope that people would just go home. But no, people can't be trusted to do what's best for the whole. *So* many people who do not absolutely need to stay are staying for the petty reasons I mentioned above. But, for the vast majority of people - you can do your work at home, you can learn to deal with little siblings that have had school cancelled, you can learn to deal with parents working remotely - but it's an ""inconvenience"" and they don't want to. Now that too many people have stayed, they're going to have to take drastic measures to get people out because once one person in one dorm catches it, there goes the whole dorm.. . About them consolidating people into fewer dorms - again, what do you want them to do? They don't have the staff to keep all the dorms running. My friends work in housing at the community centers. They've all been told to go home. RAs have been told they're allowed to go home. If any housekeeping (or otherwise facilities staff) has so much as a cough, they need to stay home. It takes a lot of manpower to run those dorms and it seems pretty entitled for folks to think they should still be able to keep the dorms running as usual. I do think the university should help students move if they decide to consolidate the dorms. Finally, consolidating the dorms doesn't necessary mean that everyone is gonna get put into one dorm. I'm sure they will still try to spread everyone out amongst a few dorms, but in order to do that, they need people who can to go home. . . At this point, we all need to quit relying on the university to have the answer to everything. They've told you what to do: go home if you are able. They're doing the best they can.",0.0,error,0.0

There is a lot on my plate with international travel, border/airport closures, family/financial issues, and this attitude of nothing is going to change until it does makes it very difficult for me to make informed decisions. . . A far more responsible approach would have been giving an announcement like ""nothing has been said yet, however this is a time of uncertainty and the following could happen: classes may move online and we may (or may not) eventually close some or all dorms, please plan accordingly"" as early as last Monday or last Wednesday. I'm sure that if I and a lot of my friends in the same boat knew this, we would be safely home by now. . .

This is what they said:. . > the government would prefer to help out multi million dollar corporations instead of assisting the everyday Joe. . Big corporations have the lobbyists and access, and they get their hardships addressed in ways that individuals rarely do. There has been some support being given out (some is still just talk at this point) by governments (local, state, and national) to try to help individuals and small businesses through this particular crisis, but it's not always the case and it's not always visible. Even in this crisis though, you could still see that leadership has twisted priorities. The initial response from the federal government was entirely centered around trying to prop up the stock market. Even weeks into the crisis, Trump was more upset about the Federal Reserve not cutting rates fast enough than he was about the CDC's inadequate testing capacity. . . It's not like any of these corporations lost a competition (other than perhaps Boeing). Their stock will naturally go back up when global consumers are healthy and financially stable enough to start consuming again, and the humans behind the global supply chain are healthy enough to continue producing. For the time being, it's time for them to shelter-in-place like the rest of us. . . Personally I like the proposal of crisis bridge loans to be made available to the public and corporations alike (an NYT columnist proposed corporations be allowed access so long as they continue employing and paying at least 90% of their pre-crisis staff, which would go even farther).
