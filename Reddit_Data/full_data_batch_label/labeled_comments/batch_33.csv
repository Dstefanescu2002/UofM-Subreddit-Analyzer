Content is interesting but not that difficult if you do the homework, attend class, read the book a little, review notes/homework/labs/exams. Labs are fun. Verilog is a little tricky at first. The most important thing to complete the labs is to draw how you want the data to flow otherwise you'll take forever hacking at it and fall behind. Labsland with quartus on remote windows is a great way to work on lab at home. Use the fpga and modelsim to test as you go. Remember that verilog is an HDL, use that to your advantage. There are many clever tricks to minimize the amount of hardware in your design (which make it easier for you and staff to debug). Also make sure you organize your project files well like naming well and keeping different parts of the same lab separate. Try to understand compile errors, you'll notice a pattern and where to first look. Be aware of spelling, capitalization, semicolons, begin-end blocks, reg vs wire, asynchronous clocks, etc. Also make comments to understand each module you design and it's relationship to other modules.

Dow envisioned how administration would work in 1968, and how quickly his vision was outdated but they made it work anyway. He was reportedly offended by the comments of it being designed as a ""Fortress"" but it's clear that is the message it sent to generations of students.

I liked that the only time the design breaks from its relentless amount of straight lines is for the entry doors. I like the 4 elevators spaced awkwardly and pretty much needlessly in 2 banks, when they are almost close enough to each other to be in 1.

It was designed as far as I can tell in 1964 when these movements might be heavy on the minds of regents, but it was still early in the movement. Things did pick up with war protests in 65 and 66 making waves and by the time it was built in 1968, Nixon was running on a platform of cracking down on protesters.. . One thing to also remember is how much Brutalism was the prominent architectural mindset of the age especially when it came to university buildings. And while Fleming was at best faux-brutalism eschewing concrete facades for a massive pile of bricks, it certainly was influenced by it, I believe the small windows were quoted to be for efficiency, and while that's a convenient scapegoat for being defensible and harder to be broken in a protest gone wrong, the main doors, where the protests would be centered around, were the biggest glass part on the whole building. . . It also didn't ever really work as a fortress. For example In 1969 protesters packed the regents chambers to protest the ""bookstore plan"" in 1987 United Coalition Against racism chained the doors and kept employees out for 18 hours until the staff snuck in via the steam tunnels. . . So in the end I'm not sure who to believe. It might be a complicated answer, it might have been Dow's attempt at an energy efficient building, 1960s regents wanting to be isolated from campus, or it might have been built as a fortress or something that could be easily converted to one if tension escalated, or some combo of all of these. . . To any effect it seems Dow preferred his homes made for individual clients over his bigger commercial, municipal, and university projects because he could cater to one couple or family. Ann Arbor certainly is a good example of why that might be so, with the municipal building being another one of Dow's buildings that people love to hate. Fleming most chances had too many cooks, and maybe too many compromises. But I'm glad it was still at least interesting.

To do so involved overriding multiple safety systems including but not limited to a programmable logic controller that issued 460 audible warnings over a 2.5 hour period (!!), each of which was manually silenced by the rogue employee. . .

For Ross - 36 mil for faculty (p. 75). So you get something between x1 to x2 on that funding (and as I mentioned before, their faculty is x1.5 more expansive to begin with). As COE deals with more undergrad population, and Ross cater to grads, COE has students affair office and scholarships, adding up to 11 mil..

My overall impression was that at times it felt like a lot of work, especially if you have lots of other obligations, but overall it wasn't super horrible. If you are a ""good student,"" meaning you start your stuff as early as possible and go to office hours, you'll be alright. Here are my tips/thoughts:. . 376: Start the homework within 2 days of when it is released. Group office hours for the absolute win!! I spent on average 6hr/wk in them. Go there to just work and to start your homework so you can ask questions to your peers and get great tips from the IA's. Speaking of which, if Owen/Claire/Daniel have group OH ever, go to them. They are super smart, clear, and helpful. Homework sets start off not bad, but there are definitely some tougher ones near the middle/end of the semester where it took me 10+ hours to complete them. 1 homework set per week, which can sometimes be a grind. Go to Zhu's lectures if you can, but DEFINITELY go to his review sessions, he gives out lots of useful exam information. Once you learn what style/format the staff expects for HW/exams, it becomes much better. Watch out for reductions. TLDR: Go to group office hours as often as possible, and Prof Zhu and Owen/Claire/Daniel IA's for the win!. . 370: The projects don't take a long time to actually code (the first one is very short/easy, took lots of people 5 hours max to read, understand, write, and submit), but they might take a while to understand (especially pipeline). Ngl, I got away with starting some of the smaller ones 3-5 days before the due date, but that was very stressful, so \*absolutely\* start them within 3 days of when they come out. The hw is pretty tricky, so find some good study partners, check Piazza, and go to OH if you need to (I never did, but the IA's are very smart). Take as many practice exams as possible starting a week before the exams. Mad respect to the professors for doing what they do, but I didn't like any of the profs my term, and they are always changing. The saving grace for me was the studio recordings (the first half of the term has recordings from Prof Arthur, who is an absolute legend). . .

The best variety of local produce is the [Ann Arbor Farmer's Market](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/Parks-Recreation/parks-places/farmers-market/pages/default.aspx) northwest of campus Saturdays or Wednesdays 7am-3pm. Other good options are [Argus Farm Stop](https://www.argusfarmstop.com/) on Packard or Liberty, probably the [People's Food Co-op](https://peoplesfood.coop/newsite/) on 4th Ave. All of those are more expensive than what you'd pay for non-local, less fresh produce at the big grocery stores around town.. . My favorite way to enjoy tomatoes are in simple tomato sandwiches with some vegan mayo on [Zingerman's bread](https://www.zingermansbakehouse.com/real-bread/all-breads/). I'd recommend their paesano bread, or maybe their cracked wheat farm bread. Zingerman's Bakehouse, where they bake the bread, is on the far south side of town, but you can also buy the bread at [Zingerman's Deli](https://www.zingermansdeli.com/), across the street from the farmer's market, and a block away from the People's Food Co-Op. The bread is expensive too...a cheaper alternative I also like is using Nabisco brand Triscuits, a fairly course whole wheat cracker you can get in any supermarket, with a dab of vegan mayo and a quartered slice of tomato on it.. . Another way to enjoy tomatoes is to make a Greek style tomato and cucumber salad...cucumbers are also in season right now.. . For corn, I like corn on the cob, with a bit of oil, salt, and pepper. You can steam it, or if you're just cooking one, microwaving is quick and convenient. To microwave, peel most of the outer leaves, with just a couple layers of leaves left, and heat for three minutes, let it sit for a minute, then run it under a faucet a bit as you remove the remaining leaves and the corn silk (the hairy part). You don't want to cool the corn, just use enough water to keep your hands comfortable.",9.0,error,0.0

If you told the Prof at the beginning of the class that you hadn't taken EECS 560 (or an equivalent course) they'd probably be surprised. The course is not designed to exist independently. . . - EECS 560 is probably a more universally useful class. There is very little chance that you'd ever find yourself in a job/project where you're using knowledge from EECS 562 and somehow do not need the knowledge you get from EECS 560, but the reverse is entirely possible. So if you're going to go and take 562, you should also be taking 560 to make it worth your while. And if you're going to take 560, then you should definitely take it first.. . - You'll be expected to *at least* be aware of concepts covered in EECS 560, even though you won't always be using these things verbatim. Having a complete knowledge of EECS 560 will help you understand the full story of EECS 562. It's like trying to watch a sequel before the original movie. Sometimes you might be able to follow the sequel, but you're inevitably going to be missing the bigger picture and likely not completely understanding what's going on.. . - There will be at least a few times where you do use certain concepts from 560 verbatim. The majority of the class is not doing this, hence why I say it's probably technically possible to get around it, but there are certainly parts of it that do. . . - EECS 562 is a bit more theoretically rigorous.

Ann Arbor is an airport that empties out in the summer. It's a miserable town for single grad student social life. You'll get the usual recommendations - join clubs, meetups, volunteer, join a sport, take up a religion, take free classes, get into a hobby, go to bars. Those are hit and miss (mostly miss - I still have no idea what people are talking about when they say most of those categories because they don't really exist) and may require time and energy you may not have. Particularly bars. They exist to make money from you, and they are clique-fests in this town. Often every dive is packed with people having dinner with others they know in places too loud and busy to meet anybody on your own. Not to mention if you don't drink and don't want to spend 20+ bucks because you've got no money. Particularly in the winter it's rough, and that was before the covid era. If you do happen across a grad student house party there's a good chance it will be focused around a single program and mainly be malicious gossip about people you dont know or topics you can't relate to. You might join GEO and god knows those people just feel like an extension of office life in academia to the worst degree. Even when you do meet people working through MA's or PhD's they can be extremely invested, not relaxed, socially awkward due to years staring into the Acadevoid, or with families and kids, or you name it. There are only a few thousand of us here, spread thin across the city and often working, traveling, or raising kids. The pool is very small. Your best bet is to learn not to want graduate student friends, to become more interesting than that category on your own, value your aloneness, stop desiring to party, learn to love and enjoy nature, and nourish yourself on your own, hoping that if you do that it will not only help you grow out of the ""partying"" phase of life but eventually attract like-minded souls down the road when you fly out of this airport.",9.0,negative,0.6089683771133423

The suggestion was, if you are looking at an electric one, is to just use the pay as you go ones and have it not be your responsibility - at least until you get a feel for it - which makes sense. If you do get a bike theft does happen, so register it and I think hiding a air tag or similar on it is a good idea and have a good lock.

I have so much more time to pursue other extracurriculars and interests that I truly enjoy instead of pushing through something that caused me a great deal of anguish and stress.. . Just try to think it through for yourself and see where you're at. Because from what I've heard, there are many members that have considered quitting without following through with it and really enjoy their time in the MMB :). . I'd recommend reaching out to some of your student leadership about this if you can. I know the flag student leaders are great. Feel free to shoot me a DM too.. . Also wanted to say that if you do end up dropping, that's absolutely a sign of strength :) I beat myself up for my decision, which really wasn't warranted because it totally was the right choice for me <3",3.0,positive,0.7105739712715149

t1_imsz9i5,2022-09-02 15:02:14,t3_x3hd13,t3_x3hd13,"There's not an easy fix to this situation. You can't blame the lack of affirmative action, because affirmative action is in itself racist. It essentially says that minorities are not smart enough to compete with white people so we have to dumb things down for them. That's not productive for anybody, and puts under qualified, pseudo-educated minorities into the workforce, unable to perform because they have not had to perform at the same level as they're non-minority peers. So of course they do poorly in the work environment which leads to emphasizing that you should hire such minorities because they are not good employees.. . The real challenge lies in reaching poor urban neighborhoods where far too many people are raised to think engaging in illegal behavior is legitimate while holding down a real job is illegitimate. That they will never get ahead because of the color of their skin.. . Unfortunately to many folks in such communities support this negative mindset, taking pride in living down to negative stereotypes. If you're somebody that acts like a normal, responsible person then you're chastised for not really being a member of that ethnic/cultural group. For example look at how Oprah Winfrey was criticized for not being black enough because she's intelligent, smart, and successful because she is driven. Total horseshit.. . The real crime is that in Michigan we spend $2 billion dollars a year on our prison system. If we were able to take half that and spend it on programs that are designed to work, not just to become another bloated bureaucracy, in affecting paradigm change in the mindset of people in poor minority cultures. We then may then see more minorities who value education and hard work, and are better able to compete with people who are raised in wealthier communities which value their education.. . Will this happen anytime soon? No. That's because talking about the real problems that plague minorities will get you labeled as a racist and a bigot. This saddens me because there are so many people, minority or not, who at their core are good people, and just want a shot to achieve their maximum potential.. . I should add that getting a good education is difficult for white kids that are raised in communities that don't value education. I was just talking to a lady earlier today who was lamenting the poor education system in the city(<10,000 population) that she moved to. This is a difficult situation to rectify as the community is electing the school board who then hires the school superintendent. If the community is happy with the status quo then what can you do?. . We can see this reflected in the Ann Arbor public schools. They are lauded as being a great school system, but in reality they are a reflection of a student body whose parents are well educated, who value education, and are actively involved in their children's education.. . If you're a poor black kid attending Ann Arbor schools, then you really don't have much coming to you. You get lost in the shuffle as the teacher's focus on the successful kids. I take this opinion from having known several black kids from low income backgrounds who attended Ann Arbor schools. Are there exceptions to this experience?Of course there are, but that's not the norm.. . In the meantime, we have to deal with enclaves of plastic people such as Ann Arbor. Where folks feign moral indignation while at the same time turning their internal eyes away from the problems which require the greatest effort to resolve.

There were two sorority girls walking in front of me on my way to work one time (Ray's Red Hots) , and they both started snickering about how if they ever ate there they would just die, what kind of person eats that shit, etc. I still think about it. It STILL hurts. I quit working there not long after that to take care of my health and my family's, but also because I was EMBARRASSED--though I didn't accept that until recently. . . I also had a friend once say something about the privilege here in that ""yeah my dad didn't go to Harvard or whatever but he still went to a good university and makes over a 100k"". I didn't say anything, I just let it sting. . . Over and over again. And yet I STILL tried to be good enough for those people. I fell for the oldest trope in the book and I'm so upset with myself for it too. I knew better.. . edit to add: I also got caught up in an abusive relationship, and no one here, even my closer and more understanding friends, really got it. When you grow up thinking abuse is love, it takes a WHILE to figure out it's not. And it's exacerbated by finances, because I wouldn't have stayed with him as long as I did if I could've afforded leaving. That's also part of why I took out an extra 8k.",6.0,error,0.0

What's tough is that while that process is happening, blunders are going to happen, and vulnerable students can feel marginalized, bruised, misunderstood. That's why ""finding your people"" could be important, they can be a buffer and a source of support. I'm sorry when that doesn't happen for students.. .

The food just isn't very fresh and high quality. Even the grocery stores that are marketed as fresh and high quality do not taste like it. The restaurants are definitely better than the surrounding areas of Michigan, but the food isn't as good as big city restaurants are. The meats and veggies taste like they are a day or two old. They also have a lot of really unhealthy burger, cheesy, fried etc stuff, but I guess mid west people like that food. . . I think the reason it gets hyped up is because many umich students are from rural or small town areas in the midwest , so the best they get from their hometown are basic pizza joints, sandwich delis and chain restaurants. So to them Ann Arbor is great, but compared to LA, nyc, Chicago etc Ann Arbor can't compete. It's not even the lack of high end Michelin restaurants in Ann Arbor, it's the regular lunch spots that are disappointing. All the Asian restaurants are disappointing in Ann Arbor too.

I had a lot of prior programming experience in Java (close relative of C++, just with some extra functionality) in high school so I skipped almost every 183 discussion and about a quarter of the lectures (largely attending just enough to get my i>clicker attendance in and figure out how Python worked). When considering the work it took to do my projects, including the final project (in my case, an AI that could do a decent job of playing Connect 4) 183 probably averaged out to 6 or 7 hours a week, maybe 9 a week later in the semester when that final group project became more salient. For someone with no experience it would presumably be higher, but it's meant to be an easyish transition into the world of programming.. . As for 203, we had a homework assignment every week based on textbook readings, not counting the studying and exercises required to figure out how induction works (a mainstay of the second half of the semester), so perhaps somewhere around 9 a week? It's not as smooth a transition as 183, but I'm looking at my old HWs and it starts out with stuff like ""if it's raining, I use an umbrella, but if I use an umbrella it doesn't necessarily mean it's raining"" so not the most strenuous at first.. . Broad takeaway here is that those two classes are very manageable in terms of time commitment. 280 is more of a beast because your projects get quite hard and time-consuming by the end and you'd greatly benefit from GSI/IA office hours, and by 281 it's practically a necessity to start your projects the day they're assigned and start asking questions throughout.",3.0,neutral,0.6726941466331482

I was first gen from a poor family with no connections. It seemed like everyone else had some secret understanding of what they were supposed to do & I had missed a memo, so I get where you're coming from. I spent my last semester working two jobs unrelated to my major so I could take an unpaid internship related to my major (media), leaving me time to just take the minimum credits required to stay enrolled. I didn't get a job until three months after graduation, and by then my mom was sick so I had to be the primary breadwinner for my younger siblings. Was that job in anyway related to my major? Not really, but it did eventually lead me to my career, which led me to Michigan for grad school. Would love to have come here for undergrad, but it didn't happen. For my second job after graduation, I applied thinking I would never get it, let alone be interviewed - I worked there for two years, so don't overlook positions you might feel under-qualified for or you only match half of the bullet points in the job posting.. . I took senior photos but didn't buy them, because I didn't have the money.

I happened upon him when I was researching a bu. . Definitely agree with not going to CMB Management. I lived in a 2 bedroom for 1.5k and moved out as soon as I was able to.. . I rented from CMB solely so that I could have my dog. Sadly, my upstairs neighbors were horrendous people that'd show up to my unit every morning (7-9AM) and every night (11PM) to yell at me about my dog or my roommates TV (which was kept at less than 10% volume with subtitles on because it was almost impossible to hear). They'd also make phone calls EVERY DAY to CMB to complain about my dog barking or the TV. Mind you, this was even when I was with my dog the entire day and she didn't make a peep. CMB called me multiple times to tell me that if my upstairs neighbors kept making complaints, then they'd make me get rid of my dog (I never would've so they'd have to evict me- ig?).. . I went to every neighbor anywhere NEAR my unit: Next to my upstairs neighbors, bellow me, next to me on both sides. Most of these neighbors stated that they hadn't EVER heard my dog bark (and didn't even know that I had a dog). Those that had heard my dog bark, said that it was for less than a minute and happened once every few weeks- if that. I provided this in writing to CMB and was told that it didn't matter, if my upstairs neighbors kept complaining, then my dog had to go.. . I bought a security camera to record my dog whenever I wasn't home, with sound recording, to prove that my dog wasn't barking. I told CMB that I'd provide this as evidence and they still continued saying that they don't care and I'd have to get rid of my dog if my upstairs neighbors continued to lie and harass me (they'd leave notes on my door and show up at my door without fail). I eventually started telling my upstairs neighbors to call the police if they had issues with me but they never did.. . A couple months later I called CMB and was told by a staff member that the upstairs tenants had asked to get out of their lease before I moved in, but didn't want to foot the bill for it. It was only after my upstairs neighbors started complaining about other tenants that CMB let them out of their lease.. . Overall, CMB let me be harassed and threatened for months because they chose to house a problematic tenant. CMB also refuses to look into issues AT ALL. I moved out immediately after my lease ended and I've never received a single complaint ever since.. . **TLDR: If you rent one of the pet friendly units from CMB and someone crazy lives near you and takes issue with it, then CMB will make you get rid of your pet. Even if you have evidence that your pet isn't an issue and you've paid the pet security deposit and monthly pet rent. Take your dogs/cats elsewhere.**",4.0,error,0.0

Letters of rec are a pretty important part of the application. In my experience, most programs expect you have 3 letters of recommendation.

They probably won't be able to write you a strong letter, although for professional masters programs, it could be ok.

Ask them for letters well before the deadlines. After both the profossors and you reach an agreement, you just put their information into the application system, waive your own access of letters (very important, you should make sure that you are not able to read any of the rec letter), waiting for their input, remind them before deadlines. Some professors may kindly ask you to draft something you want to highlight as well, but most professors just write letters without you knowing anything. . 2. I always think getting rec letters is a thing that you need to plan for a longer time. It might be biased, but for a graduate program, my friends' and my rough ranking is as follows:. . Master: Professor you have done research under \~ Intership supervisor > Professor you have worked with (staff, teaching assistant, etc.) > organization mentors that you have worked with > class professors (but you have to make sure that you have close connections and perform well). . PhD: Professor you have done research under >> Professor you have worked with as teaching assistant \~> Intership supervisor > organization mentors that you have worked with > class professors (but you have to make sure that you have close connections and perform well). . For all my friends and I, we were working hard to avoid having a professor that only teach you in a class to write us a rec letter. However, if you have to include such a professor, I think you need to make sure you have impressed them - go to OH quite often, have good connections, and perform well in the class. The key thing is, the more your recommender knows you, the better.. . 3. I would say ask them now, even if they know you very well now, they might forget some details later.

t1_inm4o7j,2022-09-08 17:26:56,t3_x92r3i,t3_x92r3i,"My experience from 5 years of career fairs (2014-2019, so things may have changed with the pandemic) as a woman:. 1. My freshman year I wore a button down and slacks, all other years I wore a suit (either jacket + skirt suit or jacket + nice dress) if I went to career fair. Flats or low, closed-toe heels. The vast majority of people in lines were wearing suits. Sure, the recruiters were in polos or shirts, but they aren't the ones trying to make a good impression. That said, they understand not everyone can afford a suit, so whatever you have that looks professional should work. Some companies, my current company included, interview next-day at career fair, so it never hurts to dress up. . 2. Carry a nice folder with your resumes. The first few years I just used a nice paper folder, and eventually I got a nice leather/faux leather portfolio. Perks of the portfolio were that it looks good, it has a notebook inside, and it has a place to hold a pen and business cards. Pull out one resume before you talk to each recruiter so you can hand it over smoothly, but keep the rest inside - this keeps them unwrinkled and clean. The folder also gives you a place to put any papers or business cards from the recruiters. . 3. If you can stash a backpack somewhere, great - if a friend or I had an office, we'd leave them there, and I let my ENGR 100 students leave theirs in the lab with me. Otherwise, don't worry about carrying it - a lot of people will have them. Just don't fiddle around with it too much if you can avoid it (perks of the folder). . 4. Apply online in advance. Most companies will just tell you to apply online anyway, so this shows you've been thinking about them. . 5. When I was a student, the career fair gave out buttons that said our major and whether we were looking for internships or full time jobs. If those are still a thing, they were really convenient. Some recruiters would go down the line scanning buttons to grab someone from a specific major based on which recruiter was available. . .

And I respect your decision-making and your ability to figure out what you most need.. . The issue that you have identified is part of a bigger problem that I don't think it's talked about enough. I know this doesn't solve your immediate issue, but I want to put it out here as food for thought. . . If you take a broad perspective on this, we should advocate for good mental health care for EVERYONE, not just college students. Getting help shouldn't depend on being in college, or being fortunate enough to enroll at a college with lots of untapped therapy capacity (assuming that exists, I'm not sure it does).. . The problem is nationwide, and it's not going to be solved by UM (or any school) going out there and hiring hundreds more counselors. Colleges are not set up or funded to fill in for all the holes in the social safety net. There are gaps that colleges are compelled to help fill; mental health is one of them, but also on that list is affordable housing, public transportation, childcare, college preparation, food insecurity, public safety, healthcare, etc. . . Most of these things aren't really a part of the mission of a university, but they aren't available in adequate supply to meet the needs of students (and in some cases faculty and staff). So institutions step up where they can, but there are limits. Ideally there needs to be a handoff into a system that is actually set up to provide these things. That's how it works with healthcare in general. You can show up to UHS for some problems that are common or that you need quick help with since you may be miles away from your regular doctor. But for longer-term or complicated issues, you're going to need to go to a specialist or hospital or see your own doctor. Transportation on campuses is the same way. Many campuses will provide you bus service around campus, but they're not going to provide you bus service around the whole town. (Here UM is a fantastic exception, while you have to get off of a blue bus and step onto a city bus to get to off-campus destinations, students get to ride on AAATA buses for free because it's part of the way the U eases transportation shortages and the parking crunch). . . Institutions definitely have to strike a balance, because they have to supply enough services that students can be successful, but if they take on too much service delivery, colleges will have strayed far from their central mission and on top of that will become completely unaffordable. Keep in mind most of these services are not things that faculty can do between their teaching/research duties--colleges have to hire people, sometimes highly professionalized and well-compensated people, to administer and supply these services.. . It makes sense that a college mental health service would be there to help address short-term issues related to the college experience, but not have the capacity to address deeper (or longer-term) mental health issues. Ideally, CAPS addresses that part and then hands off as needed to an industry provider connected to your health insurance, and affiliated with a practice or clinic whose mission and infrastructure is set up to provide mental health care. . . The fact that this can't happen for many people because their insurance won't cover it, or there are no providers available, is a big problem, and it stems from issues with health insurance, and the healthcare industry's approach to mental health, and our attitudes towards it in this country. It's not just a problem for college students who are looking for more than their college can provide, it's an issue for a lot of people.",14.0,error,0.0

You don't need to talk to a counselor to switch your course enrollments on WolverineAccess\*. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:. . - Judging by their current syllabus, 183 does mandatory attendance and stuff like that (although there are workarounds for adding late, see next bullet point). So please ensure that 183 has a section which would fit your time. . - You would need to do some catch-up work for 183 since you'd be adding late. I found [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xky_nQCyaeTvt1S3MZsz8LVtf8eeuYH5yQrAspAm8MQ/edit) on their course website (eecs183.org) which explains the exact logistics for catching up upon adding the course late.. . \*Technically there is one thing that could stop you from just adding eecs 183 right now: if adding eecs 183 would make you go over 18 credits, then WolverineAccess would stop you from adding it (i.e. in this case, you'd have to drop 280 before adding 183). If you're 100% certain you want to drop 280, then you could drop 280 and add 183 on wolverineaccess.

Some people have social anxiety, autism, adhd, depression, pmdd, ptsd, ibs, and various other disabilities that make having the time and energy to put into friendships constantly very difficult.. . I have a few myself in addition to being from a very poor area. People here would talk about how great their parents are and like, what am I supposed to say? My parents are abusive drug dealing addicts? That have every-ism they could possibly have and have disowned me for it twice in undergrad alone?. . Yeah, it's easy for people to make friends that already know how, it's already easy for them. My parents kept me locked in my house for 18 years. I hung out with my best friend after school a grand total of twice. We'd been best friends since kindergarten. I was bullied severely in high school. I came into undergrad in an abusive relationship with no self-esteem, thinking I was normal because that's what it was like back home. It's not normal, and the people here don't understand what it's like for people in other circumstances. It's a kind of performative diversity/inclusivity here, they say they're accepting until you actually have them confront it.. . I did try to keep up with my friends though. They'd show up late or cancel last minute or straight up ghost. Not my roommates though, or my best friend (she also ended up coming here). But otherwise? I have tried so hard to be enough for these people, to dress well enough, be on trend enough, be funny enough, be closed-off enough so I don't scare people away with my ~crazy life~ (tried that after my freshman year), nothing ever really worked. I should also note that my freshman year and most of my sophomore year I tried being myself, being a confident version of me. Still wasn't enough. I started doing the party scene hoping that'd help me make friends, but all it really did was get my already mentally-ill ass way too deep into weed and alcohol. I burnt myself out very very badly trying to make friends here, to the point where I started prioritizing friends over school because I simply couldn't do both (to the point that I failed many classes and came close to dropping out), and I just wanna let you know:. . It's okay to have just a couple friends. It's okay to have no friends. Don't push yourself to do things that drain you or don't feel true to you. It's okay to go outside your comfort zone and assess the risk/reward, but don't ever feel like there's a problem with you. The people here aren't as welcoming as they'd like to believe.. . In terms of making friends though: the dining halls are pretty good for that, the library, just existing in public and trying to appear approachable rather than closed off. If you have stickers on your laptop or waterbottle or other merchy things you can adorn, that might help you make friends too. Also! It's never actually too late to make a friend. At any point in the semester, or at any point in your college career. I know that seems like a lie, I always thought like that too, but it's more like, do you want to be friends? Or do you want to regret not trying and never knowing if you could've been? I may have not been treated too kindly be a lot of the people here, but if I hadn't tried, I wouldn't have learned, and I would've regretted not trying. As for dates, I'd recommend dating apps to getting to know people irl or over snap or whatever as friends first and then shoot your shot. I personally regret my dating app shenanigans, only ever ended up fucked over by them.

I used to play a game with them when walking around campus where whichever one of us says hi to more people would win. I would always easily win because I would say hit to 30+ people every time I would walk anywhere.. . Sophomore year I worked as an RA and a bunch of my other friends moved in together on the opposite side of campus. My other friends switched majors and I never had a class with them after.. . Due to this, I really only had 2 or 3 good friends sophomore year. I was part 3 clubs: an engineering club, a dance club, and a volunteering club. But I didn't make any friendships that lasted outside of the club meetings.. . Second semester sophomore year, covid hit and we all went home. I lost contact with a majority of my friends and was unable to make new friends.. . Junior year I worked as an RA again but was able to rekindle some of my friendships from Freshman year. By the end of junior year I had maybe 3 friends left compared to my close friend group of about 10 from the end of freshman year.. . Senior year I met more people and made more friends. But they all had existing friend groups and didn't invite me out all that much. My friend group grew from 3 to 5.. . After graduating, I moved to Detroit where I have met tons of people everywhere. College was a very difficult environment to make lasting friends when covid is factored in. And I don't have any issues understanding why it is hard to make friends. Sure it is easy to meet people, but it is so difficult to continue meeting with people if you don't go to parties, have classes together, or live together.. . My best advice is that don't be upset if you don't make friends immediately. Don't be upset if you don't like the people you've met so far. Don't value yourself based on how many people you know or what you do every weekend. Go and join a social club (vide games, art, movies, exercise, hobbies, etc...) that has meetings weekly and find a group of people you like. It's much easier to keep going to club meetings when you like the people there.. . Also, don't become an RA and try and move in with friends/good people for sophomore year.
