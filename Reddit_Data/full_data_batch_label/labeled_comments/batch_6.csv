There are two stats classes, two operations/ linear programming classes, a markov chain/queuing class, economic decision making, ergonomics, data processing, and simulation as the main core classes. Students then take engineering non ioe classes such as thermal, material science, circuits etc... . . After this you get the flexibility to take upper level courses that explore statistics, linear programming/ production control, ergonomics, or workplace theory ( lean, continuous improvement, organizational management). At this point besides senior design and tech community, there is some room for taking a couple of ross classes as electives . . Ioe majors work on process improvement or making things better. That sounds broad and that is true. Traditional roles would be doing time studies, continuous improvement, and ergonomics work to make factories safer, more productive, and efficient, . . A lot of my friends are going into consulting, since that field deals with improving processes. You are also very well equipped to work in supply chain, I have some friends who went into data analytics as well. Some go into ergonomics work or even in data science work. Another interesting line of work is healthcare improvement, which is quite unique. Every major corporation can improve their processes, which is why ioe majors can easily find employment. . . As for it being Ross, that is really true. It is more like a more technical version of the technical operations courses in Ross. The courses have business applications, but the majority of the class is not devoted to case competitions or business examples. You can easily get jobs that Ross majors get, but you will have to learn case style interviews. In terms of recruiting, we do have our own career fair, but it is not like Ross's system. . . In terms of the program, you will get a lot of disinformation, somewhat like this thread, because IOE is very different from other engineering majors. It has been a major frustration of mine given the attitude that other engineers give to IOE, but please ignore them. They like to hate on ross and IOE and every other major that isn't typical engineering. For example, the comment below saying it is a waste of time. This is very wrong, IOE majors are very likely to not work under the title of industrial engineering, and many of them go into management later on.

I would advise you to take less work (maybe drop math 115) so you can focus on acing your major courses and not worry about salvaging decent at best grades from these unforgiving intro-level courses.. .

There are plenty of opportunities to meet new people, you just have to make a little effort upfront. Find a club or two that you're interested in and go to their meetings. If you're in a position to work, on campus jobs are a great way to meet a lot of people.. . In terms of future things to keep in mind, definitely look into one of the summer programs offered: [UMBS](https://lsa.umich.edu/umbs/students.html), [Camp Davis](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/camp-davis/), [NELP](https://lsa.umich.edu/nelp/about-us.html), etc.. .

Part of it stems from the origins of the program as a place to put student athletes that wasn't challenging and kept them eligible without distracting them from their sports. They are trying to change the program and shift away from that but I still found that the classes left me very unfulfilled. 2 years of SM classes and I can't really tell you one concrete thing I learned there that Ross didn't teach better and more in depth.. . As for trying to also major in business, the reason I had to drop it is because it ISN'T feasible to dual degree with Ross and SM. I tried, and being out of state I was intent on doing it in 4 years because I couldn't afford a whole fifth year paying 50 grand. I came in with something like 30 AP credits and it still was going to be tight. It honestly isn't worth the stress. If you can get into Ross I would recommend it so much more. The SM program just doesn't have the same resources in terms of advising and career outreach that SM has. . . Additionally, I had a really bad experience at the end of my sophomore year which is what led to be dropping the SM program. The way the program works is that you ""reapply"" at the end of your sophomore year to be admitted to level 2 so you can begin taking 300 and 400 level SM courses. During the orientation for the level 2, the decided to drop the bomb that they were restructuring the major and that we had only one year to take four classes (12 credits) that were required to graduate and then those classes would be discontinued. This all comes TWO WEEKS before class registration. Problem is, Ross requires 13.5 credits in your junior year fall semester and I had planned to go abroad during the winter semester because it is the only time Ross allows you to go abroad. When I reached out to my advisor in the SM program all I got in response to my worries that I had wasted 2 years trying to dual degree was a shrug and an offer to drop down and become a ""sophomore"" again and wait a year before continuing on to level 2 with the new curriculum.

You're right, and that's precisely the problem. Anyone who *would* be motivated by research over compensation is being outbid by the private sector too. My point is that this is what universities need to be more competitive in, not salary. At the end of the day, the ""burden"" of working for the government or for the private sector is often that your research isn't motivated simply by the advancement of the subject, but instead by geopolitical goals or profitability, respectively. You only get to pursue your interests insofar as they benefit the institution you work for. The reason the tech industry isn't quite as marred by that limitation as others is because it is by and large more willing to invest in research in good faith that someone will eventually arrive at something profitable. This makes the private sector good *enough* for the more research-minded folk. Universities just haven't figured out how to make themselves more appealing than ""good enough.""

While it seems like so many people at this university are smart, and while in part this may be true, almost every single one of us has our own fair share of struggles and whether we deserve it or not we all unfortunately suffer at sometime in life. It's amazing to me that you had the courage to take this leap and transfer to LSA to pursue something that you're interested in and that shows such determination and courage as I'd definitely be too scared to do something like this. Everyone definitely has their weak points and unfortunately this semester might be yours, but trust me it can only get better from here. Everyone has their failures and I truly believe if you can identify your weakness or area of improvement, which it seems like you have, then my friend it truly is only uphill from here. It's so difficult to not compare yourself to others and I struggle with this as well -- we're constantly surrounded by people who go above and beyond that often times it's hard to ignore that and just focus on yourself. I would definitely recommend speaking to someone, maybe an advisor or counselor, because they can be extremely helpful or just finding someone to talk to about it because it's easy to let your emotions get the best of you.

So, I'm going to give you some advice as a senior who also transferred to UM, had a 3.0 GPA in high school, and suffers from anxiety, depression, and ADHD. It's a long post but as someone who has been very close to where you are, these are what I have found to be useful.. . 1. Do everything in your power to get the help that you need in terms of medication, therapy, whatever it is that you need. Do it. **You and your health come before grades or other peoples judgements on your worth.** Choose to define yourself by your own standards instead of arbitrary ones imposed by others.. 2. Medication, therapy, etc... aren't going to suddenly make you amazing at school or life, they just put you back onto a level playing field. What you do after and during that is what helps take you to your goals. . 3. **Success in all of its forms, is primarily a result of habit, not genetics.** Olympic athletes don't achieve that level of success because their genetic makeup says they are going to earn 23 gold medals (Michael Phelps). They achieve that success through ridiculous amounts of work. Work that at some point is a result of habit, it's what they become used to both mentally and physically. Academic success is the same. **You got into UM. You are smart.** Choose to build the habits that will make you successful. . 4. When I say build habits, I truly do mean build. Don't start with ""I'm going to study for 3 hours every day."" You will burn out if you try to do that. Start with ""At x time every day (whatever time you find works for you. But keep it consistent across your days) I will spend 30 minutes doing homework and studying."" Then a week or two later, add maybe 15 more minutes a day. In adding 15 min/day you will go from 3 1/2 hours/week to 5 15/week. Still need more time to get everything done? Increase it by another 15-30 mins. If you increase it by even a little bit every day, the time adds up.. 5. **BE CONSISTENT.** Consistency is the builder of habits, successful habits build success. . 6. **Set realistic long term goals.** Something that is an improvement over where you currently are but still attainable. If you are failing all of your classes, set your goal as ""Next semester, I want to pass all of my classes."" etc... Don't forget to modulate your goals by things like difficult of a class etc... . 7. **Break your long term goals down into smaller achievable short term goals.** Long term significant success is built upon many many smaller successes. If your goal is to get a low B- in a class, that means that you average a B- across all of the smaller aspects like homework, tests, quizzes, etc... So smaller goals can be something like ""I want to get an 80 on the quiz next week."". 8. **Create short term plans to achieve short term goals.** For me to get an 80 on that quiz, I think that I need to primarily study these specific areas that I know I am weak in and review the other areas that I am more confident in. For me to achieve that, I need to spend X hours studying (depends on the class, comfort with topic etc..) across the next week. Repeat this for each class. . 9. **Take breaks.** Everyone needs breaks, build them into your schedule so like everything else, they become part of your habits for success and prevent you from burning out. Do not just take breaks as you feel you need them. **Be intentional and consistent about taking care of your mental and physical health.** I think this is frequently what gets most people here at UM into bad spots. People get so focused on goals, goals, goals, they forget to take appropriate care of yourself and taking care of yourself, should always be goal #1.. 10. **Not achieving a goal is NOT a reflection on you or your self worth.** Shit happens. Accept it, think about what you can learn from it, move on.. . If you want to talk, feel free to message me! I'm always happy to talk to other transfers!",6.0,error,0.0

Those of use further from graduating have more time, and therefore have lower priority.. . The question is how do you measure how close someone is to graduating? Some people graduate in 3 years, some graduate in 5 years. (Unless you're double majoring) the only thing that's consistent is that everyone needs 128 credits to graduate. Therefore the more credits you have, the closer you are to graduating.. . The fact that people who went to schools with AP programs had a better opportunity to earn more credits is merely incidental.. . Let's define two sets of students. Set A had access to AP classes and set B didn't. Once those in set B gain the credits that set A came in with, they'll have the equal opportunity that A had (albeit later in time). The time difference may seem a bit concerning, but students in set B were going to have to earn those extra credits in university anyways. The registration appointment allocation system doesn't affect that at all.. . TL;DR: Inequity exists, but it isn't amplified by this registration appointment allocation system. It does suck that your currently in last place, but it will provide you equal opportunity once you reach the point others started at. It is still effective at what it was designed for.. . It's all a question about whether you want to put people entered the university at the same time on equal footing, or whether you want to put people who will likely graduate at same time on equal footing. You can't do both, since those groups aren't the same.. . For reasons explained above, I think it makes a lot more sense to put those who will likely graduate at the same time on equal footing.. .

I had also began to sense a palpable culture of competitiveness that even slightly tainted my relationships with my classmates, especially when it came to curved testing. This environment was psychologically toxic. I had my first panic attack the night before a winter final exam that year because I had spent the previous three days studying with (maybe) 5 hours of sleep. And unfortunately it worked - I received one of the best grades in the class on that final exam. That experience instilled in me a message: my health must suffer if I want to succeed at U of M.. . After that, my grades increased year-to-year and I ended up graduating with a 3.2 GPA (which for me was pretty good - my first semester was only a 2.3). However, my anxiety had run rampant and I felt I couldn't ever take a mental health break (which in hindsight was very damaging). I started a job in AA right out of college and four months later is when I had a total nervous breakdown. I was on FMLA for a month to recover. I started to experience suicide ideation. I visited the psychiatric emergency room a couple of times (the same one you checked in at). I was put on medication. I went to see multiple counselors. I started take anxiety classes. My life was a mess. Now, four years later, I still have bouts of anxiety and depression that pop up here and there.

And, yes, 'Latinx' would be another example of this sort of exclusionary language. The distinction here is that there is a difference between how you refer to *yourself* and how you refer to *others*. When you're referring to yourself, you can pretty much choose anything you like as an identifying group. While certainly there are loaded words of various forms that tend to bias the listener, for the most part people are willing to call you what you want to be called.. . However, when you're speaking to others, you need to make an effort to speak to the identity they choose rather than the identity you choose for them. If you advertise a 'Latinx' event, the majority of people who can trace their descent to the old Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the New World will not show up because that term doesn't refer to them. On the other hand, if you were to open a 'Mexican' restaurant, you'd not only get people who identify as Mexican or Mexican-American but also people who just like Mexican food.. . > And while I think it's definitely good to have conversations about antiblackness and transphobia in feminism, I really think that in this case your analysis is overcomplicating the original intent of the post.. . If you're talking about ""anti-blackness"" and ""transphobia"", you're not having a conversation. These sorts of loaded terms are designed to paint people as villains - and it should come as no surprise that such people don't want to talk to someone who frames the conversation that way.. .

These places, to be competitive, they're meant to break you. A little bit, at least. You're *supposed* to have nights where you get 3 hours of sleep and have to struggle to not fail. That's kind of the trials and tribulations of getting a degree. It sucks, but there are a lot of less competitive schools that have a more relaxed atmosphere. If you want, you can go there. And I don't mean that in a douchy way, I really mean it. There's nothing wrong with getting those degrees, but they might not carry the same weight because, well, they aren't as competitive. That's the tradeoff.. . . . What I think comes into play though, is that when an institution is designed to break a person, where do they set the bar? They want to make it hard for ""the average"", but what's the average? At UofM, like 80% of students have incredibly high financial backings from their parents, wonderful K-12 educations, piano and violin lessons since they were 5, robotics clubs they've been in at their private STEM High School, whatever. It's harder for UofM to break these students, so the material gets harder.. . . . So then what happens to students who don't have these advantages? They end up suffering more, working harder, and getting less out of the school because of it.. . . . Everyone I met at UofM who had some Doctor or Business-person or Consultant Parents with some 160k+ income left their lives from High School completely behind, came to UofM, did great all things considered, and then left all that life behind to be doctors or consults or whatever themselves. But it's not everyone. And often I think UofM is just better for the former than the latter. . . . . So OP, your post is kind of all over the place, and it's kind of difficult to tell where you're actually at. UofM might be leading you to struggle, but you've also been able to create your own business at it. That's not some bumblefuck hobby you get to do if you're an average student over at Central Michigan University. So yes, grading can be arbitrary and obnoxious - your GPA doesn't dictate how smart you are but rather how well you can follow rules. But all things considered, it could be worse.",2.0,error,0.0

The individual thinks that harm is occurring, or is going to occur.. .

With some insight into how lab funding works, it doesn't make sense to disparage labs for posting positions requesting unpaid labor when they are clear that it is a volunteer position. There's a difference between a lab not being able to pay a student and a lab not paying a student because they expect free labor, and it isn't fair to believe it is always the latter case. If it's the former, then I don't see any harm in asking - it's either win-win for the lab and the student, or neutral because no one benefits or loses.. . More broadly, there are plenty of paid (in money or credit) research positions, so it's not like we're denying poor students opportunities to do research or bolster their graduate school application. In addition, research experience, while intangible, is an *extremely* important part of the graduate school application. With that in mind, if your primary goal is to make money in school or to help get a job, this opportunity wasn't really intended for you in the first place, hence ""if you don't like it, don't apply"".. . So, I can understand frustration against the system if every single research posting was unpaid, but that's not the case, and if you're good enough to perform unpaid research well, you should be good enough to find a paid research position if you need to be paid.

Coming in without a technical background is very normal and the SI program caters to that, but that means it's not quite as rigorous as a traditional data science program. If you push yourself to take all of the advanced data classes SI offers and put in the extra work to /really/ understand them, it can be a very rewarding program and great way to get technical skills without a traditional CS/math degree. There's also a required internship which is a good way to get some experience under your belt. Best of luck! If you have any questions, I'm happy to help!",2.0,neutral,0.6563196778297424
t1_fb6bkmr,2019-12-17 01:30:42,t1_fb5omth,t3_ebi3m5,"> Yes, UROP requires an application. That's not much different from normal lab job postings; you have to apply regardless even if its not an official application.. . Yeah, but you cited as if it was a solution to all this, that they ""just use UROP kids"", not everyone has that ability to be in UROP. . > More broadly, there are plenty of paid (in money or credit) research positions, so it's not like we're denying poor students opportunities to do research or bolster their graduate school application. In addition, research experience, while intangible, is an extremely important part of the graduate school application. With that in mind, if your primary goal is to make money in school or to help get a job, this opportunity wasn't really intended for you in the first place, hence ""if you don't like it, don't apply"".. . This whole passage just reeks of privilege, and I'm an out-of-state student on my parents' dime.. . Do you see your contradiction? Research experience is extremely important, but by offering these unpaid positions, you're offering something that poor students cannot take advantage of. And nobody's primary goal is to make money in college lmfao, they make money because they need it to survive and are poor. And what is this about the opportunity not intended for people looking to get a job? The sentence before you said these experiences are crucial for grad school apps, which people get to secure a later job.. . My gripe is that there are research positions offered at a university that are counterproductive to, what should be, the university's goal of helping students of all economic backgrounds. If a research team cannot afford to pay an ugrad assistant, they shouldn't even offer the position. It effectively excludes those that cannot afford to take that time out of their schedule.",0.0,neutral,0.6780710220336914

Did you really want a research position that pays money or credit and doesn't require an application? Opportunities are limited, period, and let's not pretend we can just give opportunities away to anyone who wants them.. . If you would rather not offer positions at all than offer a position to a subset of people (when the reason is lack of resources, not malicious), then I don't know what to say. You would rather no one gets an opportunity than only letting ""the privileged"" have a shot. That's quite ridiculous; if a student is able and willing to volunteer and is going to really make use of their time in the lab well, what gives you the right to stop them?. . Ultimately, if the lab was willingly refusing to pay students when they have the resources to, then I'm all for outrage. But I can't get behind leveling the playing field to the point nobody benefits, instead of trying to help as many people as possible even if unfortunately only the more privileged can be helped.

I believe ChE students typically finalize their PI during October of their first year, though I suspect most come in with a good idea knowing who they will work with. Most students are offered some form of fellowship funding their first term so you aren't necessarily tied to a PI from the start. . . Where you'd want to live can depend on any number of personal preferences and budget levels.

t1_fbky70k,2019-12-21 19:27:40,t1_fbity22,t3_edf2bk,"I think Illinois has a significantly stronger program than Michigan, from talking to students I know who attend/attended UIUC and from researching the programs. While I think the difference is most notable for upper levels, where Michigan offers less electives (for example, graphics and numerical computing courses are not offered), and has an irritating amount of overlap between several remaining electives, I think it's also true for lower levels. The lower levels at Illinois seem to cover more material, most notably systems programming and functional programming, which are almost entirely skipped below the elective level at Michigan. This puts inappropriate burden on electives (like EECS 482 (operating systems)) to make up the difference for some of the material that would otherwise be covered, introduces even more overlap between electives, and leaves other material out. I also think Illinois covers theory (algorithms, particularly) quite a bit more strongly than Michigan. For example, while I think EECS 281 (data structures and algorithms) is a very well done class at Michigan, Illinois covers data structures more deeply with their own class, and covers algorithms in a separate mathematical style class. Here, our required theory class (EECS 376) feels like it's trying to do too much, leaving little time for algorithms, and the part that does cover algorithms just feels like a somewhat more rigorous version of what 281 covers. The lower levels are still good here, and not too crowded in terms of the spots available (though office hour queues can be extremely long), but I think Illinois has a clear edge.. . Additionally, something to take into account is Michigan's very high out of state cost. If you aren't receiving a lot of financial aid, Illinois will be several tens of thousands of dollars cheaper over four years, especially when taking into account the lower cost of living in Urbana-Champaign. Michigan's program is still very good, but just not worth the money for out of state students, especially considering the lack of enrollment caps. Since it sounds like you'll have a lot of AP credits coming in when you start, you will have less of a problem registering for classes than most, but it's still an issue that I think prospective students should be wary of. Personally, in hindsight (and had I known I wanted to do CS from the beginning - but that doesn't apply to you, obviously), given the choice, and had I not been an instate student, I would've attended a school with limited enrollment that was slightly worse ranked than Michigan, like Maryland or Purdue, to avoid the overcrowding.. . The way I see it, the best reasons to come here are that a) you are an in state student (or your costs will be lower than attending other comparable CS schools for some other reason), b) you strongly prefer the university's campus and atmosphere (as you mentioned - but keep in mind that unlike at e.g. Illinois, Michigan's engineering campus is separated by a 15 minute bus ride from the rest of campus, which can be a bit annoying) to that of other universities, c) you want to take advantage of programs that Michigan is stronger than comparable CS schools at, such as those within social sciences or humanities, d) you think it's more likely than not that you'll switch out of CS to another program. Michigan's flexibility with switching majors is nice in general, but a significant drawback for an extremely popular major like CS.. . As a whole, I kind of wish I had picked another school, but I had a good deal being an in state student, and I did enjoy some classes, especially EECS 281, and didn't think any classes were outright bad. I definitely would have picked UIUC if I knew what I knew now if I were in your situation.",3.0,error,0.0

I'm not super qualified to answer this question as I've only been here for a semester, but I think I have some good advice. . . 1. My experience so far has been life changing, even one semester has changed who I am as a person and is allowing me to realize who I truly am. My degree was impulse and I chose it because computers are truly what I love to do.. . 2. Although I am taking mostly core math and science classes like chem 130, math 115, 116, physics 140, and engr 100/101 right now, it still can be challenging. However, depending on your high school work ethics, it can be a walk in the park. I'd say it's a solid 6/10 so far with 17 credit hours freshman year, I expect it to get more difficult.. . 3. I believe this is the most important question on the list, for any college. I never went out and had fun in high school, mostly because I didn't have the fun or the friends to do so. However, in umich, I get joined two student orgs and have been hosting get togethers almost every Friday to play smash in the dorms. The ability to forget about school for a night allows a total shift in work ethic and has helped me a lot through the first semester. Make sure to have fun. You'll have plenty of time to sleep if you get your work done early. . . 4. Honestly, I don't know, I hope to be a clean room silicon worker in a big tech company.. .

Best thing to do is to find a group of friends that is in your major that can help you with stuff. Just be good at time management for your assignments/tests and you won't have an issue. . . 3. Social and sleep life was just fine. Sure there were some nights I stayed up late to make a deadline but in general I got good sleep and was still able to hangout with friends. Like I said above, as long as you plan ahead when you do your work, it's not hard to have fun as well. (Having fun in college is very important, you'll miss it after you graduate). . 4. This is a hard one to answer, as it can vary a lot. But for me my day to day is literally solving issues and improving the product for a customer.

t1_fbqbjua,2019-12-22 15:55:33,t3_ee61c1,t3_ee61c1,"It depends on your programing experience coming in before college. If you're talking about internships in the summer after freshman year, it would be pretty difficult if you don't already have a good amount of programming experience coming in to college. The recruitment process starts really early (early-mid July) and most mid-large companies stop recruiting around end of November. If you don't have a good knowledge of DS/A coming in then I don't think 280 alone will be enough for you to be able to pass technical interviews. You can try to go for some smaller companies during winter semester but this is pretty late and you will be taking 281 concurrently so you won't be ""set"" class-wise because you haven't learned all the knowledge yet (assuming you don't already have extensive programming experience).. . The good news is, most people won't get an internship after freshman year, nor are you expected to. If you're not an experienced programmer coming in (which is completely fine; most people including me weren't), then instead of focusing on internships I would just focus on getting used to your college life and classes. Preparing and applying for internships is a grind in itself and combined with classes like 203/280 can be a very stressful first semester.. . For adding class projects to your portfolio, I think this is fine for 281 projects (280 projects are a bit too simple), but I would suggest replacing those with your own projects whenever possible because if you're at career fair everyone is going to have the same class projects on their resume so it doesn't really make you stand out. Another great way to have projects is to join a project team or do research with a professor, but a lot of these opportunities require you to have taken EECS 281.. .

The best thing about Umich in particular is that everyone is doing really cool stuff so it's super easy to get inspired.. . 2) It's definitely challenging, sometimes the exams just don't match the material you studied or you get completely bodied by a homework set but in the end you learn some really cool stuff and it's totally doable. The intro calc sequence is a bear so id recommend taking it honors or taking it over the summer somewhere else but even then we all get through it. Basically, everyone finds different things different levels of challenging - so if you can handle 3 technical classes and 18 credits then go for it but there's no shame in spacing things out. If you didn't come in with at least 10 AP credits then you will most likely need another semester to finish unless you go ridiculously hard all four years.. . 3) it varies, this semester was great and I had plenty of social activity and sleep. Last semester sucked and I was routinely missing sleep and wasn't as social as I would have liked. Having friends in classes helps because you can study together and see eachother in class though it's totally not necessary. Basically, on a normal day you can get sleep and social activity - but sometimes you gotta put your head down and take care of work instead.. . 4) I'm focusing on power and energy and looking to go work for an electric utility. So I'd be planning power lines, doing fusing/relays, figuring out how to integrate renewable resources, etc. depending on where I end up it could be half field half office or a fully office job",5.0,positive,0.9662730693817139

I haven't run across anything in life I can't figure out (or figure out it is worth paying someone else to do for me). PhD was a cakewalk after Michigan Engineering.. 2. The undergraduate advisors' pep talk when I first arrived put it right when someone asked about the honors college in LSA ""you got into Michigan's College of Engineering, you're already in an honors college."" It is a challenge but very respected once you graduate. If you can do it, I recommend planning for 5 years to keep your coursework down to \~12 credits a semester (this may be a large financial burden suggestion) as to help with #3.... 3. Depends on how many credits you take. Taking the minimum to maintain full-student status opens up your schedule for more extracurricular activities. If you're pressed with minimal AP credits coming in and only 4 years to complete everything, you'll spend a lot of time in the library and less time socializing with a 16+ credit semesters. Spring/Summer semester classes are useful for spreading it out and cost is minimal in the long run if you already have year-long leases for your living situation.. 4. Outside of very specific fields (e.g., ChemE going into petroleum engineering), your skill set can carry over to a lot of fields. The most lucrative with the best work benefits currently is in software engineering. A lot of my friends from undergrad ended up working for financial or tech companies (e.g., Google, Facebook, Bloomberg) that recruited right at UM during career fairs. They live out in SF or NYC on $250k+ salaries and stock options. I happened to go the government route with the FDA as I have a personal interest in cell and tissue engineering. No complaints, but government doesn't pay tech money. The jobs you'll quality for will be high paying and intellectually stimulating with a degree from Michigan. I highly recommend co-opting or interning at companies to get started after graduating. A graduate from any university with zero experience is a graduate with zero proof they'll be good at their job. Work the alumni connections to get those initial jobs. Michigan Engineering is great for that as all alumni know what you'll bring to the company from personal experience.",2.0,positive,0.9038586020469666

Are you trying to prove something to someone? Are there external parties that have very high expectations of you?. . In the EECS environment, it can be very easy to forget that you came to college to learn (and probably also to get a degree so you can more easily start your career). No part of that requires that you be as good as everybody else by any sort of grade standard. If you're failing, that's one thing, but it doesn't sound like you are (you got mean / below mean, so maybe you're getting Cs in the worst case). As the age-old adage goes: Cs get degrees.. . For what it's worth: I'm a GSI for 482. It can be a lot to take in for those who don't have a solid footing coming in. I see a lot of students fumble through the projects trying different things until it works, because they have little practice in debugging their own programs to the level required by these projects. It's a great class for confident students to take. The staff does hold lots of office hours, and we want to help you understand the concepts and projects, but you're often jockeying for time with many other students in OH. This does not mean that other students don't succeed; the vast majority of students in the class end up doing well on the projects by the end.. . My personal recommendation, if you have such flexibility, is to consider pushing back 482 until you feel you have gained a more solid footing in EECS, which you surely will soon if you feel you haven't yet. I recommend this because the less effort you spend frantically trying to achieve some grade in 482, the more of the content you will probably internalize and take away. 482 offers some of the most useful knowledge for soon-to-be software engineers. In fact, I'd say that 482 and 481 are, imo, the two most valuable courses to take if you want to improve as a software engineer. Also 485, but mainly because of the specific languages and frameworks it introduces you to.. . If you don't have such flexibility, then take 482, and don't be afraid. Know that you almost certainly have what it takes to pass the class, or even to get an A. Know that you have 12 staff members who are here to help you through it.. .

Not that I'm complaining, but just be aware o that. . 2. It is really challenging, but you could say that about any engineering program. Don't let this deter you. The reality is, we all want easy lives, but easy lives don't exist. Instead of thinking in terms of how hard it is, or how much money you can make, you should ask yourself what concepts you enjoy. That enjoyment and sense of purpose will get your through the difficult times. In my case, I chose Chem E, because I didn't know where I want to land in terms of jobs. Chem E is a jack of all trades field and graduates can find themselves in Aerospace, Software, Biotech, automotive, and material science jobs. That said your perspective is still chem E, so you do fill a certain niche which other fields can't fill, but at the same time, you're not replacing other fields. For example, I do modeling on the side, so I am eligible for to do software jobs if I choose to, but I don't have the same reportoire as a CS graduate; however, I can frame and design pseudo code better than some of my cs friends due the different training. It's a give and take. . I would suggest you figure out what you like to do, more so than skill sets. You can also improve on a skill, but you can't teach passion, and quite a lot of people switch or drop out because they realize they hate the field they are studying. Caveat: I would avoid Biomed E as an undergrad. Biomed E is too new of a field rn and the teaching hasn't been standardized across the nation yet. Thus biotech and biomed employers are hesitant about hiring those grads. If you want to Biomed or Bio E, I would recommend choosing an older field as a major, and then doing a biomed project. . 3. Social life and sleep life depends on your work load and friend group. More units mean less time for other things. During undergrad I chilled with friends on the weekend, (but went hard during M-F). I did a 1 year masters and it was miserable. I was always studying balancing the work, not to impede on my sleep (I have a strict 7+ hour sleep policy). A word of advice is know yourself and figure out what your goals are. You might see peers who look like they never study and good grades, while you're always in the books. That's fine. You're not lesser for it. Stay on your path to your version of success. A critique of umich I have is the hyper competition, Even though I did well in undergrad and still doing well in grad school, everyone places their worth on their grades. That's a wrong perspective. Have good grades, yes, but you should be gaining skills, doing projects and gettting internships AS WELL as learning how to connect with different people. The last two parts are important. 4.0 may get you into the door, but so many 4.0 students don't get the job because they don't know how to interview. Remember, the first interview invite means you have the skills for the job. Now employers want to see if they want to work with you... 4. I'm in grad school since I wanted to do Biotech (if you want to go up the ladder you need a PhD). But I have experience as a research intern and sales engineer. You can make a lot of $$$ as a sales engineer if that is your goal, but keep in mind, once you leave the technical track it's hard to get back in, and sales engineer is more like a salesman selling tech to companies but you have technical knowledge to provide. Personally, I loved my sales engineering job, since you get to meet different people, but it's not for everyone.",3.0,error,0.0

You will have.... not a lot of trouble finding a job as long as you graduate. I was toward the bottom of my class, almost failed many CS classes. Did fail a few core reqs (think math) and transferred in several grad requirements from community college. . . Granted, my GPA wasn't too bad overall (3.02 I think) with all that considered plus getting good grades otherwise by pointedly taking easy classes. But if you did the math on my CS only classes, I'd prob have a C+ average. . . I went to career fair in the fall and had a ton of interest. Now I'm a good interviewer and managed to squeak out impressive enough *sounding* internships at no name companies. But I got offers from two F100 non-tech companies and was interviewing with another when I accepted an offer. Then was all set and had papers signed by thanksgiving for the next summer. It's much easier to get jobs at non-tech companies (think manufacturing, finance, retailers) if your programming skills are say below average for umich. Work won't be as techy type interesting, but if you're in the bottom of the class chances are that won't bother you lol. . When you finish 280/281/270/376, and the physics+math reqs it will become possible to make your workload easier and lighter. Skip 381 and OS and just take all the db and security classes. Fill in what you can with easier lsa courses and find a blowoff flex tech in like AOSS. That's what I did. I mean someone has to be at the bottom of the class lol. Most peoples jobs just don't require even close to the level of mastery of any concept that you'd need for a B+ or better at umich. . . It all just comes down to whether that's what you want. REALLY THINK about whether you want it. Getting a CS degree sets you up mostly to program. Do you wanna do that? If not, I'd change! This is the easiest time in your life to do so. . EDIT: If there is some way you can remedy your grades, do so! Really do evaluate how you study, the time you put in, your class+office hours attendance. Can you change things to improve? That being said, I strongly disagree with people in this thread implying this *must* be the solution. Lots of smart enough people fail these classes! It's a curve, someone has to fail!

I have relatively little experience with other CS programs, but this seems right to me. There's a huge industry focus at Michigan and a lot of emphasis placed on private sector internships. Twice a year there is a huge career fair where tons of Fortune 500 companies come and students interview with them for internships + post-college employment. That's a big ""selling point"" and probably a good thing to put in your essay if you are interested in working in industry.. . I'd say theory is pretty strong as well at Michigan, though I'm biased (I'm a theory student who TA'd a theory course in my undergrad). . . > Classes like EECS 280 or 281 have ""supposed"" test trials beyond just their solutions to projects that simulate the real workforce.. . I think(?) what you're getting at is that students have to write tests for their code and submit that along with the assignment. If so, this is definitely true for 281. I didn't take 280, so I can't 100% confirm that. . . > UROP is somewhat unique to Michigan?. . Uh, maybe, I'm not sure. It would surprise me if other big research universities didn't have something similar but idk. When in doubt, don't make a strong claim like ""UROP is unique"", but rather say something along the lines of ""Michigan has many opportunities for undergraduate research such as..."". . Also keep in mind that UROP is not the only way to go about getting research. There's also SURE in the summer. I'm pretty sure there's a learning community focused on research too. Idk how useful it is, but maybe worth mentioning. You can also inquire about research opportunities by emailing your professors (what I did).. . > Classes like Introduction to Computer Security, Machine Learning, and Advanced Artificial Intelligence are all classes that give the ""practical"" aspect of computer science in the real world.. .

Probably you need to retake 183 as soon as possible, as it's a prerequisite for many other things. . . 2. You didn't commit the Honor Code violation.

You should know if you followed the Honor Code policy or not. Very rarely was there an ambiguous case heard by the Honor Council. Lots of claims to the contrary, but the instructors have been teaching these courses for a long time.. . Edit: I realized that I didn't actually answer either of your questions. Yes, they will change the grade whenever the process completes. If you have a pending case you will get an ""I"" for incomplete.

My advice is to tour a lot of places that weren't build after the millennium, and keep in mind that new != nice. The fact of the matter is that you just straight up aren't going to find a nice looking apartment in Ann Arbor near campus.

You don't need to and shouldn't start projects before they are released and I think it is an honor code violation to do so. . . Additionally, don't just grind the projects, actually plan them out and write your ideas down on paper, not only will this help you learn the material it will also save you time. Start the projects early, not just so you can finish them, but so you can use the extra time to practice the material using geeks for geeks and leetcode. Much of the exam material is not covered deeply in projects or labs directly, and if you don't practice it, you will be mad at yourself when it shows up on the exam. Also when you do practice problems it can be helpful to write it out on paper or a whiteboard so you can think through your code instead of just running your code until it works (not only will this help you for the exam but also interviews). . .

Even if the student in question did something that they knew to be outside the EECS 183 policy e.g., providing a student in the current semester with code they developed in a previous semester, they still would have earned the grade they earned in the previous semester. There would be no logical justification to modify the student's grade from a past semester other than arbitrary punishment, which the Honor Council has been usually adept in avoiding.",2.0,negative,0.49249985814094543

However, they recently switched to waiting until the final grades came out for those classes, so they would decide in May if you were applying for fall semester. This was the process for cross-campus students who applied during the winter semester though, so it could be different for prospective students from other schools. If it's a similar process, then I don't think you would be able to finish the classes in time since the latest that I have heard the university make decisions is in June (for waitlisted students). If you don't want to wait until Fall 2020 to apply, then it ***might*** be worth your while to apply to LSA and then do a cross-campus transfer to CoE, since you would be able to apply this Winter 2020 semester, and then hopefully apply for a cross-campus transfer in Fall 2020. Although I'm not too sure how credits would transfer from Purdue -> LSA -> CoE, I don't think it can be more than 60. Lastly, I'm not completely certain if what I said would be viable, so I would strongly recommend speaking to an advisor or admissions coordinator if you want to find out more details about transferring.",2.0,neutral,0.8757703304290771

I was able to get multiple internship offers (nothing top tier, all local) as a sophomore this year, due to a combination of applying to as many places as possible, spending lots of time on personal projects and resume, doing a lot of interview prep (leetcode, studying commonly asked behavioral questions), and luck. Also don't feel bad if you don't get an internship (tbh you very likely won't) as a sophomore even many sophomores who 4.0 203/280 don't get internships.

They used to guarantee that OOS students whose family made 90k or under and had assets worth 25k and under were guaranteed to have their need fully met. Now it doesn't mention it anywhere on their website so I fear it now does not hold true for future students. However aid is guaranteed to not change much for current students as long as the financial status stays pretty constant. This is actually kinda sad though.

You will probably take the Intensive 1 course of your language in the fall and the Intensive 2 in the winter (second semester).

All my best friends in the RC were STEM majors interestingly (PiTE, Stats, MCDB, Physics, Chemistry) who were incredibly artsy, passionate people. The community is as much as what you make of it (I don't recount having too many RC friends beyond my hallmates, tbh) and the classes are 20-25 students, which are honestly going to be the size of your math classes from the regular sequence, and even smaller if you're deciding on honors. Same with humanities, you'll have large 200 person lectures but 15-20 people in your discussions (seminars) that don't make the class and major seem as large as the university. I didn't have to take a language since I passed Spanish proficiency (6 years of language study and IB Second Language Spanish) so I got an even smaller group experience where I satisfied my language ""requirement"" instead of taking readings through doing the Spanish Language Internship Program (SLIP, which is a 1.5 credit class) and teaching ESL in Spanish at a church in Ypsi and also facilitating language roundtables. I really enjoyed my RC classes like my first year writing, Corn in East Quad, the arts requirements (afro-Cuban drumming was super fun) and it didn't load me up too much (many electives are 1.5-3 credits and not stressful) and was honestly a welcome break from the Honors Math (295-395) sequence culture of being extra rigorous, quantitative, logical, etc.. . Mind you, the living experience can be very different from a traditional dorm first-year experience (Markley and West, for example) where an idea of a fun weekend night in many East Quad halls is making tea, doing open mics, and staying in and knitting/making art vs. the debauchery that happens in other dorms where friends recount many nights of dorm parties/pregames and loud, late nights which might be some peoples' cup of tea and not as much for the others.",3.0,positive,0.6966962814331055

That doesn't mean it's impossible though. The catch would be if you did transfer is showing that you really want to do y work when you do x work i.e. would need experiences. This would be difficult to do since if you did nursing work, would would have to get some type of engineering experience i.e. take classes, shadow an engineer for a few weeks, etc.... However, at this point you are already adding more work to yourself. I'm not sure how the BSN program works at Michigan but what I do know from friends who recieved their bsn is they felt their degree was all encompassing at the time. I don't know you, but you may not have the time to do the extras for engineering, or vice versa. . . . If you have the funds, I would apply to all the colleges you're interested in to meet the deadline, and then look up what biologists, biomed engineers and nurses do and especially what level during spring while you wait for acceptance. A lot of students misconceive that you get to do really cool things in engineering and science. While true, that seldom happens in industry with a bachelor level degree because you don't have the skill sets. If you want to do the really cool you'll need a PhD, which some people may not want to do. Again, I don't know if this applies to you, but you should know. . . . Secondly, find out why you are interested in each field, specifically, and what you are trying to do within that field. For example, if you want to help people directly, nursing would probably be the way to go, if you want to want to develop new diagnostic tech Bio med is the way to go. If you want develop new anticancer drugs, Bio is the way to go. . . . This may seem like a daunting task, but trust me, you need to do this work now.

It's a great class to take if you are a non major and have some interest in the subject especially, or if you think a NERS major might be for you. It isn't too in depth in any area, but gives you a solid introductory basis as the name would suggest. . . I would say that the lectures are a bit dry and can be hard to make it to sometimes, but it depends on the lecture. Some of the concepts are hard to figure out how to apply, but once it clicks it's really neat material. There is actually more calculation than I expected from an intro class, but none of the problems are exceptionally difficult and they are often really fun, honestly. It's the first class I can remember where I *enjoyed* doing one of the problems on an exam. . . Class consists of weekly homeworks and 3 exams.

I personally had a really shaky time in my first time around at Michigan, including a couple aborted efforts at Washtenaw to finish off math and science courses. Mostly motivation/bad habits. I ended up leaving Michigan and working an office job for several years before returning to Washtenaw and ultimately getting readmitted to Michigan and finishing my degree.. . One of the things I immediately noticed when I came back to Washtenaw is how trivial it was to motivate myself into doing all the boring crap. Sitting through a three hour lecture followed by reviewing lecture notes and doing some homework is oh so much easier after years of pointless soul crushing meetings. I suspect a four year enlistment will have a similar effect for you. At the CC level, doing all the dumb shit you gotta do is like 90% of the secret sauce; take the classes seriously even when they don't encourage it\*. I knew several students who had crappy high school grades, and yet were transferring out as a-students.. . \*First class I took during my reunion tour was intro to philosophy, to test the waters to see if it going back to school was going to work out. The professor didn't take attendance, didn't assign homework or required readings, made lecture notes available online, gave out extra credit to everyone who attended the pre-exam reviews where he basically pointed out what would be on the exams, which were three non-cumulative tests of twenty multiple choices followed by a short free response question. Anyone with a pulse and like thirty minutes of pre-exam studying could get an A. And yet, not everyone did.. . More practical thoughts on Washtenaw/WCC and Michigan/UM:. . * If you want to go to UM, WCC is not only a great choice, but it's actually better than a lot of four year programs. UM is infamously picky about transfer credits, and WCC is pretty good about designing the courses such that they are accepted. Nonetheless, check the transfer database beforehand.. * Even if they don't transfer, not a bad idea to take an extra course or two that's relevant to what you'll take at UM. If you have to take statistics (cough STATS 250), for example, MTH 160 is a good intro even though it doesn't meaningfully transfer.. * Don't take any online courses, UM is super picky about them.. * Spring/summer courses are an easy way to speed things up, but are paced crazy quick, which can be a problem for some subjects. Humanities or social sciences are probably fine, but math/science probably not.. * I don't think I ever had trouble getting into classes so long as I signed up early. Usually everyone on the waitlist who showed up got in, but some courses fill quickly (physics) so don't wait until the last minute.. * A lot of professors teach part time at other schools and do a course or two at WCC for extra income, so overall the courses are fine in material and teaching, though slower paced and less vigorous than their UM equivalents. You would also mostly be taking 'everyone has to take this' courses, which are generally not good at UM anyway. If you make an effort to learn the material, I would mostly expect you to be prepared for followup courses at Michigan.. * I believe 3.0 is considered the minimum for consideration, and \~3.6 is considered competitive for transferring to Michigan. Frankly, I think if you are putting in the work and effort but not getting a 3.6 at WCC, Michigan might not be for you anyway.. * I would not work a job at the same time, if there's at all any way to come up with money for rent/food/etc. Even without the GI Bill, WCC is cheap even by CC standards, and turning even a single A- into an A is worth far more than $9/hr serving coffee.",5.0,error,0.0

When I was accepted, I was kind of disappointed because I began to like my backup options very much. The stress came because the application was competitive and my gpa was not stellar (3.4). However, they care about positive leadership and demonstrated leadership very much. As I mentioned, since I have had to work throughout my college career, so I was determined to move to a student manager position in the dining hall to demonstrate leadership. I also did undergraduate research into Chinese financial regulation, which I think demonstrated business interest. I had no business experience prior to college -- no DECA or business classes from high school. My essays were polished by Ross students and alum, and they communicated my deep interest in positive leadership. Remember the application is comprehensive and is looking for intelligent, diligent, and passionate students. We're all at Michigan, so proving superior intelligence is much more difficult (in my opinion). I have two or three friends who had 3.7+ GPAs who were rejected.

Freshman year is a foundation year, so they make you take a bit of everything, but it seems like this is the case at a lot of art schools.

I was initially denied, but I went to OCC for a year and transferred in. I'd like to think I've experienced a little bit of everything here at Michigan, going into my last semester. . . When I first got here, I was placed at bursley. I transferred in the winter semester, which I don't recommend, and so I had to either hang out with high school friends or try and meet some new friends. I did a little of both. I looked at some clubs to join, so a lot of my time was spent in these clubs, looking to find new people. I spent some time at the gym nearby, which is super nice now by the way. I'd play pick up basketball and that was always fun as there was always games going on. My first semester here sucked. Maybe I shouldn't have FTed this girl who didn't go to school here as much as I did. In general, I just couldn't find my place. I also didn't even know what degree I wanted to go in. I also transferred to Arizona State. . . The next fall, which was my first fall, I joined a social fraternity. Being a pledge occupies a lot of time, but overall I liked it. I was more social than I had been my first semester. I met so many people and that was great. And now going into my senior year, I still live with some guys from that fraternity. I now had a tailgate to go to, people to go out with, etc. fraternities are a great way to party when you're under 21. However, I really did not pick the right fraternity. I don't fit in with most guys there, even though I've met some great guys that I really like. We also got kicked off, but we still have tailgates and such. Overall, I would really recommend a fraternity whether it be social or professional. Professional fraternities have a ton of fun too, you meet a ton of people, and you're not going to get kicked off. I honestly think fraternities and sororities provide great connections that you don't know you'll find useful. For example, I want a Jeep. One of my brothers parents owns a Jeep dealership. I can now at the very least ask what I should look for in price and other things because of this connection. . . But Greek life gets old after 21 and you can go to a bar. I also really didn't fit in, so I joined some clubs. First, I joined the yoga club because I love yoga. I also joined the boxing club. This was something that was really big to me. I couldn't try out in the fall as I had broken my foot, but I tried out in the winter and was turned away. I worked hard over the summer and made it last fall. I then went abroad to Australia, which was insane and awesome. If you can do it, do it. Save your electives for it. But I then worked really hard all year and eventually made the A team of the boxing team only to realize it wasn't really for me. I can't wait for next semester as I am going to be joining the film club. I guess what I want you to know from this is that you might not find what moves you at first, but keep on looking and even if you never find it, you're trying and you're going for it and you're going to meet people along the way. . . I believe that I eventually found my calling. I went from undeclared to polsci major to Econ major. I really like Econ and the way it makes me think. I wish I found it earlier because it made me really enjoy math and I wish I was a math major or minor. Initially I wanted to go to Ross, but after my experience, I think Econ is the right place for me. . . The things I think I did right in college are going abroad and trying new things. The thing I wish I could change is that I wish I prepared more for things. If I prepared more for rushing, I wouldn't have rushed the fraternity I was in. I would've figured more about my major and what I wanted to do earlier. Also, one really important thing I've learned is that procrastination always catches up to you. If you need 25 hours to study in order to get an A, and you decide to put in 1.5 hours a week just to keep up with your classes, you're gonna get that 25 a lot easier and you're going to do well on your midterms and HWs and quizzes. You can wait till the last week and then put in the 25 hours and get the A, but by that time you've already screwed up on your previous assignments. I can't tell you how many C+'s and B-'s I've had that could've easily been A-'s and A's had I just kept up with my classes. You're gonna have to learn the material anyways, you mine as well learn it early and reap the benefits. . . That was a lot to ramble on, but when I think of my day to day life here I think about how much it changed and that's what I wanted to illustrate. Lmk if you have any questions.",8.0,error,0.0

I chose to go to Michigan because I got incredible financial aid, and when I say that I mean it blew MSU's aid out of the water.

I've spent time on both campuses, and know many people at both. I do think the dorm situation as well as the dining hall situation at MSU are a lot more comfortable/pleasant than here. With that said, most people here only live in dorms and have a dining plan for their first year. . . I have my complaints about campus culture and the city of Ann Arbor, but as a whole I think I made a great choice, and the best choice that was available to me. Students here are very serious about what they do, and it shows in how hard they work. I wouldn't say anything is too cutthroat, rather, people are very competitive with their own selves and it especially shows in times when workloads/studying is heavy. People here work hard and play hard, and that's evident every weekend- tailgates, frat parties, house parties, co-op parties, bars, clubs, I've seen it all. . .

I had applied to just a few other schools: Wisconsin, Michigan State, Eastern Michigan University, and (at my parents' insistence) Cornell. Got accepted by all of them except Cornell. Oh well.. . I was quite happy to get into UM, not just because of its reputation, but because it meant (A) I wouldn't have to deal with moving out of state or even out of my hometown, (B) I wouldn't have to live in a dorm; I could continue living in my own room in the house I grew up in, and (C) I could qualify for in-state tuition and Michigan-based scholarships/grants.. . So yeah, for me at least, housing was a non-concern. I just took an AATA bus to and from central campus. With the student ID card (MCard), taking the city buses is free. It was nice not having to spend $$$ on room & board. My parents were pretty easygoing and didn't mind me staying put while attending college. . . I should mention that I grapple with some pretty serious mental health issues, mainly Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Being able to remain in my traditional environment was a big, big deal. Before I was accepted by UM, I was having panic attacks thinking about being forced to live in a dorm. For most people it's probably not a big deal, but for me it was a *terrifying* concept. Bullet dodged, thankfully.. . As far as food goes, hell, you probably know the stuff here about as well as I do. Lots of pricey stuff downtown. Lots of typical franchise places like Panera and Subway. Back in 2009 there was a Taco Bell and Wendy's on central campus in the basement of the Michigan League, but those have since closed and there aren't too many cheap fast food joints in the area. I have heard they're opening a Taco Bell in the renovated Union though! If you're wondering about food in the dorms, I wouldn't have a clue, though.. . In terms of financial aid, I recall qualifying for a fair deal of federal and state grants/scholarships due to my high school GPA as well as the content of my FAFSA. There are a number of Michigan-specific scholarships you can look into [here.](http://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/states/michigan.htm) I don't know what your FAFSA will look like, so your mileage may vary.. . Not sure if there's anything else on which I could have any relevant input. Hopefully someone else here will have something to say specifically about Stamps and Ross.

My family also has a crazy high deductible on health insurance, so the University Health Service has been an incredible opportunity to get free routine medical treatment. In addition, there is free tutoring available for low income students. For everyone, the university has a great opportunity hub and other services and advisors to help you find good internships or other experiences. We also have 2 large and free museums! Also from my experience going from LSA to SOE and back to LSA, inter campus transfers are not that difficult once admitted so long as you are qualified. Also, as far as culture, it REALLY depends on the major. I am double with English and Psych. English is a very warm, supportive, and collaborative environment, whereas psych is much more competitive, but I wouldnt call it cutthroat. However, I hear Ross can be like that.

t1_fd7e3x1,2020-01-05 05:44:08,t1_fd74k7w,t3_ejyo7a,"Well, I can't say it was completely smooth-sailing. In fact, plot twist, *I never actually graduated from UM!* But, in another plot twist, I'm actually returning for the Winter term next week. Trying to finish the degree I've put off for so long.. . It's hard for me to judge how the rigor of UM's courses will affect you. Not only do I not know what the classes are like at Stamps, I haven't taken any classes at all since 2016. You'll have to ask someone who actually went to Stamps about their experience at that school.. . The issues I personally encountered, which prevented me from graduating within the usual 4-year timeframe, were tied to my overall negative outlook on life, not the courses at UM being too difficult or stressful. My Depression was making me suicidal and unable to focus on classes at all. I chose to withdraw for a few years to try and focus on my mental health. I'm doing better now that I've found a medication that actually helps, and feel confident enough that I'm making the decision to return.. . There are, supposedly, resources on campus that purport to assist students with mental health concerns. The one that comes to my mind is [CAPS](https://caps.umich.edu/). I've never personally made use of it, but word is there is so much demand for their services that they are often overloaded. People even [meme about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/eb04cf/thank_you_caps/) and [voice their complaints about them on this very subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/dzoy74/what_the_fuck_even_is_caps/) So, the school's support for those with mental health issues is...dicey. Better to seek help through your health insurance like I did.. . Ultimately, I can't promise that you won't have any breakdowns. All I can advise is that you choose your courses (and course load) very carefully. This applies to college in general, not just at UM. There are some hyper-motivated people here who can do a full course load (12-18 credits) on top of working or doing an internship. I'm certainly ***not*** that person (only taking like 7 credit-hours this upcoming Winter semester!), but being a full-time student as opposed to a part-time student does affect financial aid offerings.. . Don't push yourself harder than you need to. Don't feel the need to ""keep up"" with other students who seem to navigate through difficult classes with ease. Choose the path that best fits your own priorities and capabilities. No one will give you flack for your decisions because they're more than likely too busy with their own concerns and tribulations. Mental health issues are a bigger problem than many people realize because so often they go unreported or unaddressed. I enjoy discussing them because it lessens the stigma against them.. . If you think leaving your parents/hometown would be beneficial for your mental health, then that is a factor which shouldn't be ignored. I know a lot of people like going to California schools due to the nicer weather. Might be worth visiting some campuses there (or in other states) to see what they're like. I don't find Michigan's weather *that* bad, but the greyness of the winter months can be wearying.. . Let me know if you have any other questions. It's good that you chose to ask about this school here. Being diligent about doing your research is pretty crucial to having a good college experience.",4.0,error,0.0

If that's not set in stone before you accept the offer, make sure there are other professors you could see yourself working for at the institution you pick. Also a good idea would be to see if the prospective advisors have graduated students that have gone on in your desired career path.. . What sorts of exposure do you get for your desired career path? Do students attend a lot of conferences, or do they go more rarely (this often depends on specific lab too)? Are these programs and potential advisors supportive of potential careers outside of academia? Will both advisors be supportive if, say, you want to go to a workshop for a potential career in policy or something?. . Make sure finding is guaranteed to the same extent for both programs (some only do for a certain number of years, some until you finish).. . See how program requirements compare, what the qualifying exams and candidacy procedures look like, what sorts of classes you'd be taking.. . Is there a GSI/TA requirement in either program?

Look into support structures available at both universities, on the department, college, and university levels - grad school is stressful in itself, and you never know if other life things will blow up.

Here is what the course coordinator said about the midterm and final curves in an email:. . ""How is the final 215 grade determined? We take the raw numbers students generated over the term and weight them exactly as it says on the syllabus. This produces, for each student, some number between 0 and 100. This is just a number, it has absolutely no meaning in isolation. The number could be 3.2, 18, 56.4, 98, whatever. It is just a number. So, for example, a student who earned a 67 on midterm one, a 74 on midterm two, a 63 on the final, and aced the rest (it happens) will end up with the number 76.55 (= .2*67 + .15*74 + .35*63 + .3*100). To give the numbers meaning: Instructors look at what was promised grade-wise on exams (that is, cutoffs for each of the midterms), what the overall average is, standard deviations, etc. and use this data to determine a scale for the course. [We also take seriously that a student should not get a passing grade if they cannot do the basics of the course.] That scale is how numbers are translated into grades. . In particular, if you earned some flavor of B on every exam (as per rough cutoffs), then you should expect some flavor of B as your final 215 grade unless you did exceptionally well or exceptionally poorly *as compared to your section's average* on the remaining 30 points that make up your final score. . . . I hope this helps,. . --Stephen. . . P.S. Many, many of you talk about a ""curve"" and how a raw score of 72 on a midterm is really a 91% or some such thing and thus you've really earned a 93% in Math 215 when all is said and done.

I'm a senior at Michigan now and still stay in touch with a lot of people from high school and can say confidently that out of the group who went to Michigan, about half have had to reevaluate/postpone/cancel their premed dreams in large part due to Michigan being brutal academically (prestige really doesn't matter that much for med school admissions most only care about making sure you went to an accredited undergrad institution and the grades you got + your ec's) while the MSU group I would say around 75-80% are still on track for being premed (by which I mean got into med school or are interviewing for med school).. . Take this with a grain of salt as obviously my group of friends is just a group, and not representative of how anyone else might feel responding to this.

The advice on this thread pertaining to the specific projects is good in giving you an idea of the progression of difficulty. There are offices hours from 2-8pm M-F, and the staff is also active on Piazza. We recommend you find a partner for projects 2 and beyond (p1 is individual), and if you enjoy studying in groups, forming a study group with other students to review material.. . Try not to stress too much! I know it's very scary to take classes without much experience in the material beforehand. As long as you start projects early in 280 and dedicate enough time, you should expect to do fairly well on the projects. . . Something new that is emphasized in 280 is edge case testing. The edge cases for certain projects are significantly more challenging, and solving them will require a more in-depth understanding of the problem that you are trying to solve. I was also intimidated by this, but in the end, just give your best effort and seek help when needed and you will do fine. Also, come to lab!

This does not make things easier though because exams will be worth more than 60% of your total grade per course (most of the time). A lot of professors provide practice problems- treat this like homework; creating a schedule for practice is important.. 3. Exams are less clear-cut than CC. Much of the time in CC, I found that if I attended lecture and did the homework, then the exam was basically just a repeat of those two things. At Umich, there's far more combined concepts and questions that you'll have never seen before (AKA: study groups and general studying is FAR more important than CC). It's a lot more WHY and less HOW. So instead of ""How is x different from y?"" it'll be ""Why is x different from y?"" . . Overall, Umich is harder than CC mostly because of class sizes and personal responsibility. You're responsible for finding people to work with + finding ways to practice the course material. If you have questions, then it's also a personal responsibility to attend office hours as opposed to just staying after lecture.",2.0,neutral,0.510586678981781

You can attend any 376 lecture/lab and there is a small portion of your grade attributed to iclicker points in lecture, but lab is not required. Not sure about 370 but I believe neither lecture or lab is mandatory.. . I would think more about which class you want to take with 281 since that's a much higher workload. There's not really a clear winner since 370 project due dates might align closely with 281 which is tough but 376 requires a lot of time on weekly homeworks. Personally, if I had to choose, I'd probably take 370 with 280 and 376 with 281. 370 doesn't really overlap with 280 or 281 and since you can have a partner in both classes, it can be more manageable. 281 is all individual so you will have to spend a lot of time on those projects, and I'd say I averaged about 4-5 hours a week on 376 homeworks.

You could argue that this water downs the competition I suppose, but I'd suppose any effect of that sort would be weeded out by 281. . . * CS is a major you can likely come in with the most prior knowledge -- this can create a really competitive environment when you're graded on a curve. In other majors, you're probably more likely to start on an even playing field. Not to mention only relatively recently did many HSs start teaching CS actively. The HS I went too was ranked number 1 in Michigan but it still didn't offer any CS/programming classes. Thinking in terms of code your first time is probably more foreign than a ME/EE problem where the approach is a lot more alike to a physics problem (not trying to be overly reductionist here, but just an example). . . * there's no real way you can cheat your way through CS imo-- when you're talking pen and paper PSs (which CS doesn't have much of outside of 203/376). I know homework is generally a small percentage of the grade and continuously skipping out on these can be detrimental as a habit when midterms come around -- but you just don't really have that sort of luxury in CS (not without significant chance of an honor code violation). . . > Also I've heard of a lot of people who drop out of other engineering majors into CS, and if they still don't cut it, they switch to IOE or SI.. .

That's best case scenario. When I applied to grad school some offered 2 years, others 3, and a few five. But don't think that means 5 years has no conditions. Often P.I's are directly responsible for student funding, so that five years is contingent on the PI having money for you, which can vary. Some profs are broke af so they don't take students. . . . Of course this can vary by department. I have a friend in the Chemistry dept, and she needs to gsi (TA) every semester for 3 years - which may sound okay, but it really sucks. You need to teach, grade, do research and take classes at the same time. Something will take a hit, and if you want to go into academia, you don't want any of them to take the hit. . . . I have another friend in the psychology dept. The psych dept has a collaborative method where all PIs pool their funding together so grad students are taken care of. Of course, Humanities and Social sciences often GSI a lot too, so it may not be ideal. . . . Also stipends vary by dept. Engineering at U of M is generally at the top making 30k give or take. My chem friend makes 28k or so. My psych friends makes 26-29k. . . . I will say, U of M has generally the best funding packages across all fields, especially when controlled for cost of living. I have buddies at the West Coast who make 30-35k a year, but Rent is much higher than it is in Ann Arbor. I personally live on my own at the moment and rent is 1200 incl utilities, which you can't say about other R1s as easily. . . .

On Thursday and Friday, Jan. 16-17, 2020, the university received several allegations of sexual misconduct by Dr. Philbert.. . We began an internal investigation Friday. Over the next three days, the university retained an outside law firm which immediately launched an investigation of the allegations, our Division of Public Safety and Security was engaged, and Dr. Philbert was directed not to report to work. I placed him on administrative leave Tuesday.. . The Office for Institutional Equity, who would normally handle such investigations, reports to the provost. Today, I have moved OIE's reporting line for all matters related to this investigation to Associate Vice President for Human Resources Richard S. Holcomb.. The U-M Board of Regents and I are committed to a full and thorough investigation, and we will continue to work to ensure the integrity of the process, following the same policy and practices that apply to all employees at U-M. It remains early in the investigation, and no findings or conclusions have been reached.. . We thank the individuals who have come forward with these allegations. We know that reporting requires courage. The university has offered support services and will work diligently to assist those who report in every way possible.. . We encourage any member of our community who is aware of conduct that may violate U-M's sexual misconduct policy to notify our Office for Institutional Equity.

t1_ffe5xih,2020-01-24 03:45:56,t1_ffdu20c,t3_es7t6u,"So to clarify... funded usually means stipend. Your tuition is usually paid by the graduate school and/or the department as well as health care (but not dental). The Stipend comes from your appointment. In U of M. grad students are called GSRA- Graduate Student Research Assistant. And you are given an percentage appointment. For engineers appointments are usally 50% which is the max I believe and the stipend is 30k give or take. Appointments can vary based on program and school, something to keep in mind. . . . Your stipend usually comes from the research grants you Faculty mentor (PI) recieves. Of course, you can get paid from outside agencies (NSF, DoD etc...) via fellowship and your faculty mentor doesn't pay you. However Research grants are a tricky business (many projects don't get funded) so if your faculty mentor doesn't get funded they can't pay you. This is why mentors and departments have different strategies. Some mentors only take you if they know they have five years of funding for you, other pools resources, but some wait and see. This is a disjointed point, but know this! Departments and your college can not force an faculty mentor to take you, even if they have money for you. Academia is very private enterprise and there is often lack of oversight. . . Generally if you get one or two years of funding, Those years are front loaded, so you can focus on research to apply for fellowships yourself and help get data to get your faculty mentor funded on another project. However, this doesn't always happens. If a grant dries up (grants expire after a few years) and the pi doesn't have additional funding for you, and you don't have a fellowship, you are met with 3 choices to continue if your department feels you are being productive. And yes people have been kicked out of grad school because of funding issues. . Either 1, you become a TA and teach a class to get paid by the department. Become a research assistant for another lab and get paid that way, or become a grader. However, don't misunderstand that five years guaranteed funding avoids these fates. Many programs have five years fully funded with one of these alternatives already embedded in the system. . . . I agree with your current mentors adice. , but you really need to find out the funding model for the programs you are interested in. In my research group, you only have to TA once ( graduation requirement) and you only TA again if you like it. However, my prof is conservative and only takes students if he knows he can fully fund students for five years. . . . To your final question yes. Cost of Living is a factor, but it's ultimately a ratio of Stipend / Cost of Living, which you want to maximize that ratio. And often, stipends aren't relative to cost of living. At U of M, I think it is, but many grad students make 30K like I do as well, but since cost of living is so much higher they effectively make less on a stipend, especially in places like NYC, and The West coast, where many R1s are located. . . . And while 30k isn't the greatest salary, many programs make less. Take a look at [This](http://www.phdstipends.com/results). It's a record of stipends throughout the years. You will see some programs don't make much. For example look at UCLA, STEM usually makes more, but Humanities and social sciences get the shafted, especially when you consider West LA is very expensive to live in, on top of parking fees (UCLA is 1k a year for parking pass) but you can see that U of M, all programs get a decent stipend.",2.0,error,0.0

Being able to come as an observer also could give people who might not be eligible to vote (those under 18, non-citizens, etc) the opportunity to engage in the process since they do still have a stake in the outcome. . .

I'd prefer to intern on the west coast and a lot of the jobs were for detroit/chicago/indy.. .

And yeah I am already thinking of grad school because I have a deep interest for Machine Learning & I want to specialize in that. I don't have my hopes up for getting in though lol. If I can't even get into UM undergrad, it seems highly unlikely that I can get into any graduate program. . .

Understand the data flow, wait states, and squash conditions for branch instructions. . . Specifically, look at the connections needed between Fetch/ALU and Decode/MEM stages for branch speculation/squash and data forwarding. Walk through some code with both of these implemented and keep track of how many clock cycles these features save or lose (if a branch is squashed) for each type of hazard.. . This will give you practice with the language, since you'll have to write test code that has each of the data hazard types (RAW, WAR, etc.), and branch or structural hazards. And then using the code in the pipeline as described above will help you better understand that.. . Practice writing a state machine will also be good. I'm not sure how far into the material you are, but understanding caches and virtual memory really just come down to doing examples with using them.. . Edit: for me, the midterm wasn't to bad honestly, if you run through examples with the pipeline a bunch.

In fact, I think the students here, while competitive as I said, are still willing to help and aren't petty. . . For example, at UC Berkeley during one of their CS intro classes last year, they had this policy where once the first person asked to use the bathroom during the final exam, no more late attendees to the final would be let in the room. IMMEDIATELY after they were told to start, someone asked to use the bathroom. Presumably it was to prevent people from entering and not that they'd been busting lol.

Michigan put me where I am geographically (on the beach in SoCal) and financially for work,which eventually led to my spouse and child. My amazing current lifestyle is the product of UofM.

Most of the students here would have been successful regardless of what University they went to; they were great before accepting to go to UMich -- UMich didn't make them great.

There's also cases where I simply don't understand the purpose of coming here. Like doing pre-med or doing a degree in ME/EE while wanting to work in automotive and not interested at all in research (this MAYBE makes sense if you're OOS, but likely not due to insane OOS prices). . . On top of this, you deal with substantial amounts of competition in not only classes, but job placement as well. Most/many companies do have hiring quotas for how many people they can hire from a particular school -- and most companies hire people in groups and rounds instead of individually. People exaggerate how many people at UMich actually end up in top positions.. . Furthermore, for the life of me, I cannot understand how/why people try to justify OOS tuition unless they got a great aid package. Seriously, people do not have any understanding of the ROI if they really think UMich is worth going 150-200k in debt (well most OOS students are ultra-wealthy, so they don't quite have this problem -- but I've met some people who do) for an undergrad degree (despite popular belief, you CAN and should put a price on education). Even if you end up getting some softdev position at FAANG or high finance Wallstreet position as so, I'm still not quite sure if it was actually worth it in the end for an OOS student. . .
