They're not considering Michigan because they think the cost will eventually be made up with a higher salary or anything, they're pretty upfront about their concerns being related to fit, and there's value to be had in enjoying your time at a school with the right fit rather than just scraping by for the next four years.

Yes, there are econ majors working in banks, consulting, etc. However, it's not anywhere near the number of Ross students, and the institutional support to put you in those roles is not really there in econ. What I mean by that is that in Ross, there are much better recruiting connections with those kinds of companies, you have a network of people within Ross to help you break into those fields (peer advisors, Ross clubs, stuff like that), and some Ross courses teach you material that you'll see in a technical interview; this isn't the case in econ.

The same logic holds for a 60K difference over 4 years, but the number is different. . . I obviously understand that college is a question of the costs and the benefits (non-monetary) associated with going to a given place, but my argument, which I have made on this sub-reddit before, is this: as far as I can tell/have been informed, there is no data available that provides not just a point estimate of salary (such as median or mean), but rather a comprehensive data set on salary, which would allow establishing a confidence interval for salary (which is to say nothing of the time series information because your salary in ten years may or may not be related to the college you go to). With this is mind, all the evidence that I have seen, things such as college rankings, academic prestige, and even changes in salary rankings in different years, appears to indicate that the top colleges are fairly interchangeable, in terms of future salary.. . The second idea, which is that you will enjoy one school, more than the over is potentially very true. Here's the problem - even the most enthusiastic and well prepared HS senior has very little clue what college is going to be like, and which college they will enjoy more. And really there is no way to know this without going through college, because college is an intense, 4 year process of maturing, not the product that is presented on campus visit days.. . I find your ""both-siderism"" pretty disingenuous because it makes it seem like I am shoing wealthy people away from the university because ""of their zip code"". There is obviously a ton of privilege associated with being able to pay OOS tuition, as you indicate earlier, but this is not some class battle, or time to come to terms with ones privilege. Rather what is occurring here is that we are all looking at different products to purchase. These are very big purchases, to be sure, which impact every aspect of your life, but they are still purchases. And what you see here, is a lot of people who made this purchase, expressing a lot of buyers remorse, while you're either the first, or one of the first people I've seen really defend paying OOS tuition.",3.0,neutral,0.7896652221679688

Your mileage may vary with student cooperativeness, I've met EECS classmates who will refuse to look at my code (when I've been the one asking for help) for fear of honor council violations, and most professors will emphasize how effective the college's code plagiarism detection is and how many honor code violations students have gotten.

And definitely **do not** be the person who copies code that a fellow student accidentally published online). .

However, the people who put the recent reviews on rate my professors seem very much in line with the stereotypical pre-health students: they only appear interested in getting an A with minimal effort.. . Most of the complaints seem to be along the lines of ""half the exam were nothing like the practice exam problems"". I realize that not everybody wants to hear this, but the goal is not to simply recall how to do specific problems. A true test of how well you understand the material is how well you are able to apply the concepts to unfamiliar situations. This applies to many subjects, not just physics. My position is that at least half of an exam should be brand new. After all, if you want to become a doctor, you will constantly encounter brand new patient scenarios, right?. . Although I am no longer there to see for myself what changes they made, if their intention is to have their philosophy more closely match that of the physics 140, 240 sequence, I see that as a good thing. I personally felt that for too long, the physics 135, 235 sequence instructors have been handing out A's like candy, including to some students who do not have even a decent understanding of physics.

I'm my opinion students should approach it like any other hard pre med requirement. Instead of memorizing practice problems or writing those in your notecard, understand the concepts. When you take the MCAT you don't have a calculator and they will test your understanding of the concepts while applying 1 or 2 formulas. The class test questions are much more in depth and difficult than what you'll see on the MCAT. You'll be doing yourself a huge favor if you seek to understand the material rather then memorize it.. . My advice is watch khan academy or other online resources before you approach a topic in class. You'll know what's coming up because of the daily homework quizzes).

In the early years of the university when there was a much smaller student population there were heated rivalries among the different classes and across schools and colleges (LSA and the Law School in particular). As is detailed in [The Making of the University of Michigan](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041316780;view=1up;seq=132), some of this rivalry was spurred by consistent hazing of new students (forced haircuts, stink bombs, kidnapping of class officers) by upperclassman. . . In 1905 a student council on campus began to arrange interclass games as a way to try and more effectively channel some of this rivalry. Among other things this included pillow fights, climbing greased flag poles, football, and tug of war across the Huron river. These still weren't necessarily tame events. [This other picture I found from the same 1931 event](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhl/x-hs12240/HS12240?from=index;lasttype=boolean;lastview=thumbnail;med=1;resnum=2;size=20;sort=relevance;start=1;subview=detail;view=entry;rgn1=ic_all;q1=1931+pillow) shows one student with a huge cut across his face while his opponent tries to hold on to the log.",17.0,neutral,0.9248352646827698

For 281 and 370, just start the projects early; if you are taking this schedule you are probably correctly confident in your ability to learn and code, and everything will come down to time management. Spend a lot of time planning and be careful the first time programming so that you don't waste time debugging or rewriting code. 281 time/memory requirements can be tight and debugging 370 is just a pain, so this will minimize inconvenience. That being said having to debug/rewrite isn't the end of the world, but you'll certainly feel worse and more stressed out if you have to.. . For 217 and 425, you have to stay disciplined about the problem sets. Start the first few early to estimate how much time you need so you can figure out when the latest you can start them is, and then always make sure you start them by that day at the latest so things don't snowball and cause panic. The good thing about proof-based homework is that you can progress on problem sets without specifically allotting time (although from what I heard 425 is not proof heavy), as you can think about proofs just about anywhere and write your epiphanies down later.. . Overall, just stay disciplined and try to start things early. The point is to try to minimize the feeling that you are constantly rushing to make a deadline as that can feel very oppressive. I always tried to start math homework over the weekend and wrap it up by midweek, while working on EECS labs/hw when I got tired of math; this helped make the end of the week feel lighter which does wonders for your state of mind, and let me focus solely on EECS for Th/F so I sit down and crank out the projects.

Cheating in CS tends to happen in the intro classes, where a decent amount of students just can't cut it for CS. They either don't have the work ethic or way of thinking to succeed in the field. I do feel that it is partially the faculty's fault that they are lazy as to assign the same projects every semester. At the very least, they should rotate projects such that they are assigned maybe only once every two years or so. However, students who either start projects late or are just lazy may end up making poor decisions. Some assume they could outsmart the system, some are just so desperate that they take the risk without thinking twice.. .

It would be made clear that everything, including a student's name and UMID and such, are to be completed before time is called. It always bothers me how students who attend such a highly ranked university can't even comprehend such simple directions. If this were something which people got sent to the honor council (or equivalent in other schools and colleges), then at least half the students would have had a referral by the time they graduate.. .

They are the student healthcare service, and they have a conveniently located free clinic that's pretty great for what it is. Most services here are free to students, they have a list of what's free to students and what's not. Off the top of my head, I don't really know, but for example if you get some medication prescribed that won't be free. Also, if they refer you to any specialists, that also won't be free.. . For mental health services you've got CAPS which I've personally had a pretty good experience with, and UHS also has a psychiatrist on location that I've heard good things about.. . Lastly, for dental, you've got the dental school. You can get free cleanings but again specialist work or fillings, et cetera will not be free - they will be reduced price though. I will say that I didn't have a great experience with the graduate endodontics clinic, personally.. . UofM also offers a relatively affordable insurance plan for students without insurance, so that's something you could look into.. . Also, obviously I don't know anything about your living situation, but if your parents have insurance that you're currently under, that doesn't change when you go to college - that lasts until you're no longer a dependent or until you're 26, I believe. But, not everyone has that option.. . Hope that helps!",15.0,positive,0.7617266774177551

In the CoE the basic requirements (ENGR101) are MATLAB and C++.. . Now, here's the thing about programming. You could go and learn all the syntax for MATLAB and C++, inside and out, and all it would really do is give you a few less headaches in 101. A common misconception about learning programming is that it's about memorizing and learning *what* things to type, which isn't necessarily true. When you ""learn programming"", what you're learning is the basic concepts and thought process behind software engineering. You learn about how to break problems down into manageable chunks, how computers handle variables, math, how to write clean code that minimizes repetitiveness, how to think iteratively/algorithmically... et cetera. The language you're using is just a different set of tools that you have to get accustomed to using.. . So my personal suggestion is to go ahead and start with Python. While there will be some technical hurdles to overcome when you move to C++ in particular, it won't be that hard and you get plenty of practice with it. Python gives you a very much no BS approach to learning to think like a programmer.

The biggest question mark is the in game decision making and player improvement. John Beilein was a great X's and O's coach and great at making in game adjustments.

If Juwan can improve in the X's and O's and deliver big recruits we could see something special. . . Juwan will have the backing of all the former players and a lot of the boosters.

The lab teaches you all the ins and outs about how to program microcontrollers. The material covered in lecture is pretty high-level, and covers a wide range of things that help with real time programming in embedded systems. To top it all off, you actually get to dive in to engineering a micro-controlled system with the final project. Since it's not an MDE, the expectations aren't too high, and it was honestly extremely enjoyable getting all the piece's to work together.. . EECS 461: If you've taken EECS 373 and either EECS 216 or 460, then the majority of the material covered in this class will be review. The exams were some of the easiest and straightforward I ever took at Michigan (thought they were all take home exams the semester I took it). The labs and ""final project"" are very satisfying and make you feel like a real engineer. It is really a fun and ""easy"" upper level elective imo.. . EECS 482: Many people consider this class extremely difficult, and I understand why. However, if you really want to get into the nitty-gritty of how almost all computing systems actually work, this course is incredible. You'll really need to put in time and effort to get good grades on the projects; if you start early and work well as a team you should be able to get them completed by the deadline with little issue. The professors, GSI's, and TA's are incredible, and by the end of the course you'll feel like you've gained two or three courses worth of knowledge and experience.. . EECS 388 and 442: these courses are completely different when it comes to the material covered, but they are both really enjoyable. The majority of the code is done in Python, and each HW/Project is truly satisfying to complete. The exams were relatively straightforward and don't have any ""gotcha"" type questions. . . EECS 470: This course is not for computer scientists. If you didn't like 370 or had a hard time with the material in 370, then don't take this course. If you don't like or understand how to code in Verilog (EECS 270), don't take this course. With that said, I don't think there is another course in EECS (except for maybe 473), where you'll learn this much detail about what makes modern computing so incredible. After completing this class, you will no longer think of a computer as a magic black box. The final project is difficult as hell, but was definitely the closest feeling to ""true"" engineering I got out of any course I took throughout my four years here.",5.0,error,0.0

But there are also plenty of fraternity men that treated me and my sisters with respect, served our community, earned strong grades, and provide each other with lifelong friendships. . . Compared with other schools, the community does a good job of self regulating and encouraging safe practices (no hard liquor or glass containers at large open parties, training men and women as sober monitors, etc.) with the SRC program. (Some of the professional fraternities have just as much alcohol around and far less training, oversight, and insurance.). . I think moving primary recruitment to the winter will be a good thing in the long run. It will encourage people to have broader experiences and discourage the people who get in too deep too fast and make their Greek affiliation their entire identity. . . Obviously YMMV. I'm not trying to be an apologist for bad behavior - just saying it's a big community with a diverse set of organizations and members.",8.0,negative,0.6238049864768982

In general, with any ""legal"" situation (which I'm expanding to this), not appearing at your trial is basically interpreted as you conceding guilt/liability. So you know, you should go, even if you don't have much in your defense. . . ""Beyond reasonable doubt"" is also a tricky thing, and individuals often interpret it a bit too conservatively. They don't really need some text log between you and your buddy saying that you're sharing the answers, they just need to come to the conclusion that it's beyond reasonable coincidence that you did it. You can kind of think of this like the old P-value from statistics. If P=<.05~, that's beyond reasonable doubt even though there is a margin of error and random chance still (I know P-Values are more complicated than that, but just take it for now).. . So I mean I haven't had personal experience with honor coding, but I would just be as honest and straightfoward as possible. It seems generally when people are really under the gun, they crack a bit. You know like ""Well we talked about the assignment a little but.."". If you genuinely didn't, just maintain that. Tell them that you know it seems unlikely, but that you're that 5% of random chance/coincidence (obv phrase it better). Say where and when you worked on it, explain any thought process you had writing it, hell, it might not even hurt to at least offer ""if you'd like, I could try and do a similar independent assignment to show I know how to do this"". If you and student B have some history, like you're BFFs who learned coding from day one together and took all the same classes, say that you might just have similar styles since you learned the same way.. . So I mean all you can do is be honest about it. I think if you remain polite and courteous and just maintain your innocence they should give you the benefit of the doubt.

It was a great experience for me, but it really is an experience that you can make your own. If you're active and participate, you'll get much more out of it than if you sit back and coast along. . . My research project was in nuclear engineering with Prof. Kim Kearfott. I wrote a paper that was published in a peer-reviewed nuclear engineering journal and the results were presented at a national conference. I ended up not pursuing nuclear engineering, but it was a fun effort anyways. . . My best advice is to be active in the community and make friends with neighbors in the dorm. Find out what classes they're in and start study groups. We had groups for the calculus, physics, and many engineering classes. It's also helpful to find people in the dorm to team up with in the engineering classes for group projects. Much easier meeting in the dorm rather than walking somewhere. . . Lastly, I also highly recommend Move-in-Makers, which looks to be called MLEAD Academy now. They do say to check with your MLC for conflicts before signing up, but I had no issues scheduling them back then.

Housing is tricky stuff to talk about, especially when you're really far from the place.. . . . The SI department is on central campus. I'm not sure what classes you have to take for MSI, but I'd assume most of your class will be on central campus. If you have a few classes at north campus, there are plenty of buses that go to north campus throughout the school day.. . . . For your budget, I highly suggest off-campus housing. On-campus housing is, to me and my budget, overpriced. You can look at the [offcampushousing.umich.edu](https://offcampushousing.umich.edu) for off-campus apartment hunting. You can also join UMich housing or market groups on Facebook. Some students got accepted to study abroad or due to unforeseen circumstances, will want to transfer their housing lease to another person. There aren't plenty of such posts, but there will definitely be some. Rent for these posts tend to be around $500 and above.. . . . With the general info out of the way, here comes the truth about Ann Arbor housing. At least for me, I always think that the closer to campus you want to be, the higher the rent will be. A single bedroom near central campus can be in the range of $600-$1200. That is not considering utilities and other bills like food, phone plans, etc. One way that I mitigate this is by having roommate. By doing so, I've been able to afford rent + utilities + bills for under $500 during my undergrad years, while being two blocks away from classes on central campus. So this might be something you're interested in doing. If not, you have to be okay with a bit of walking or commuting. But honestly, Ann Arbor is a walkable city, and I usually walk from my apartment near the south campus to medical school and I do not find this annoying or taxing at all. Disclaimer though, I like walking. So yea, from here you have to figure out what your first priority would be (ie; price, distance, etc.) and decide which factor you don't mind forgoing.. . . . Another option is to do apartment hunting through craiglist. Apart from craiglist, some properties in town that I find more affordable are Prime and Campus Management. I would advice to stay away from high rise apartments like Zaragon, University Tower, Six11, etc.. . . . That's all I can think of so far. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

t1_epbyyar,2019-05-29 16:46:45,t3_bugcpa,t3_bugcpa,"Disclaimer: I worked at the Computer Showcase 4 years ago as a repair technician. . . . . The 4 year plan offered with safeware is incredibly comprehensive and super easy to deal with. I personally purchased it for multiple devices of mine and have made a few minor claims with it. It's one of the few policies that covers user damage/accidental damage (Where applecare does not). Many other policies will refuse to fix/pay for repairs on a computer that has water/liquid damage even if that is not the cause of the problem you are seeking to fix. I've seen students that dropped their computer, smashed their screens, or spilled liquid on their computer get repairs covered through safeware. Additionally, there are many authorized partners that you can do repairs at and have safeware reimburse you. . . . . The major downside to safeware is that it works as a ""bank"" system, where your total coverage is up to the initial (Maybe double?) cost of the computer.

A lot of times you never even see it because it goes right to your account to pay for charges like tuition and housing. But if you've got money left over, because of the size of your aid package (or because you're living off-campus) it's up to you to allocate that money. Your ""cost of attendance"" is based on the average cost of living on campus, but you could end up living somewhere that is cheaper or more expensive--that's you choice and the effect on your budget is yours to manage.. . ETA: And so specific to your books question--if your aid has a set book budget, no one is going to ask for your receipts and insist on a refund if you found a cheaper way to obtain your books or didn't buy as many. It's not practical for them to track your costs at that level, so they build your budget based on averages and don't revisit it unless your status changes (for example, you don't attend full time) or your expenses are so much higher than expected that you think you have grounds to appeal it.

For noon games, students are waking up at 730/8 to start drinking, so the friday night before is a lot more tame. With 330 games, you can go out friday night and be fine, but the game ends at a super awkward time of like 7. It's really tough to keep drinking until 10 when it's time to go out, so a lot of people just pass out when they get back at 7 from 7 hours of drinking/standing up. Then you sleep through prime pregame time. With night games, you can stay out late friday night, sleep in, wake up, grab brunch, and then it's about time to pregame. Then when the game ends, it's 1030/11 and you can keep your buzz and head straight to the bars. It's a lot easier to power through when the games at 7. . . . . Just my opinion. Also, as a college football fan in general, 330 games are the worst because you basically miss the entire day of football. With noon games, you can see the afternoon slate and all of the evening slate, and with night games, you can see most of the day games. 330 just screws you.",2.0,positive,0.6150945425033569

To be honest, there are a great many Undergraduate Degrees that are really not useful on their own. I mean you can apply to jobs that just require any bachelors degree (and there are quite a lot of those), but you know, it's very much a stepping stone degree.. . BHS is, largely for pre-health majors. I mean there's no way around that. There's no pre-med degree at umich, so it's the closest thing. . . That being said, it's a pretty good option for a dual degree or if you plan to get a masters. Aside from Orgo it's not a terribly difficult degree, which lends itself to a lot of flexibility in terms of gaining employment experience while at school or basically just ""doing other shit"". This is more useful than it seems as despite the promises of a Umich Degree being this magical thing that will get in any job anywhere... I find that many employers don't really give a shit about it and much more care about your employment history. . . Anyway, so to go onto the meat and potatoes, it's pretty broad. If you're interested in maybe forestry or other environmental work, this is a pretty great degree if you tailor your classes to that. If you're thinking more of a graduate degree in anthropology or similar but want a science background, also pretty good. Maybe interested in Public Health/Epidemiology as a grad degree but don't want a Public Health UG major for some reason? They're close enough, and BHS probably has more of a science backing to it. . . So I mean I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you, the degree isn't that useful on it's own. However, it serves as an incredibly versatile stepping stone to just about any other degree/path you could think of. So if you maybe don't have everything figured out yet and just want to try some shit in the non-engineering sciences out, it's a pretty good degree.. .

Not saying it is impossible to major in an music/art field while completing all premed courses, but it will be extremely tough (and expensive) and I recommend evaluating which professional field you actually want to pursue. From a quick glance, there is almost no, if any, overlapping courses between the premed requirements and SMTD majors except for maybe some general education courses. That means you will need to take a lot more classes compared to other students. On top of that, for the music side you will need a lot of time to practice, for the premed side you will need to do get **very** good grades + volunteering work + get some undergrad research experience in order to be competitive when applying to med schools. And you will likely have to travel a lot between north campus (where SMTD is) and central campus (where most science courses are other than engineering), which can become a time constrain. . . For me, even without the premed, it was a lot of work and time commitment to do a BS in my field, art minor, and my part time job. . .

Like, as another commenters said, Autonomous vehicles are really huge for research right now.

I think the ""largest"" of the ones you've listed, just in terms of sheer ""how many good paying jobs are there for these"" are:. . 1. Artificial Intelligence. It's just the most broad, and what ""Artificial Intelligence"" means is increasingly stretched to more and more things. It's also a *little* more particular to UofM's EECs program, and in general Umich just has more resources than many other schools. If you want to be flexible and work more in the software aspect of robitics you really can't go wrong here.. . 2. Manufacturing and Construction: Obviously huge, but more of a traditional engineering degree. This is like the hardware equivalent of Artificial Intelligence in that it's extremely ubiquitous. Again, if you want to be flexible but work more in the hardware part of robotics you can't go wrong here.. . 3. Manipulation: This is kind of a niche in manufacturing and construction, but an important one. Almost any assembly line, any repetitive task that a robot completes in industry has some degree of manipulation to it. Especially in the Michigan area with industries like GM it's a pretty huge one. . . 4. Robot Perception and Visualization: This one is more unique, and it's a niche within Artificial Intelligence. I'd say this is probably one of the most up and coming technologies, and arguably one of the more complex. I mean this is used for everything from facial recognition to self-driving vehicles to roombas to military technology that can identify the make and model of a missile from 12 miles in the air (don't underestimate how much the military employs engineers). I'd argue most of these jobs are more west coast or southeast based in more tech hubs of America, if you're into that kind of vibe. . . So that's just kind of me spitballing it.

So to get on with it:. . > written intent to disrupt the communities that revolved around the drugs that the government deemed ""dangerous"". . When you say ""Written intent"".. what do you mean? It's two very different things to say ""We believe this drug is dangerous, and we want to get it out of communities so it doesn't harm them"" (even if weed typically isn't dangerous) and ""We believe these minorities are using this drug, and we want to take it away from them expressly just to oppress them"". So when you say ""written intent"".. I just personally have not seen actual writing with meaningful influence that suggests the latter.. . >the naming of marijuana was coined to help associate cannabis with mexicans. . Again if you had a source for this that would be useful. Marijuana obviously has etymology in Mexican Spanish (though with some bastardized spelling). So when you say the term was *coined* (coined meaning 'invented') to associate cannabis with Mexicans, I'm not really sure how that would make sense. You could make the *argument* that Anslinger purposefully used 'marijuana' over 'cannabis' in order to purposefully associate the drug with Hispanics, but I'm not sure if there's actual evidence that this is the case. It almost seems more likely that marijuana was simply becoming the more common phrase, just as ""weed"" has largely begun to take place over the now clinical sounding ""marijuana"". . . >So you have people(mostly colored) who are still being targeted by this racial ban and getting felony sentences for simply owning too much marijuana.. . Agree with you here. A felony is essentially a social/employment death sentence, and there's absolutely no reason individuals should be punished this severely for it. (there's really little reason it should be illegal at all).. . >Regardless if the faculty are racist, they are still adhering to racist laws.. . I think this is kind of the main point of contention I have. I just don't know if the 'laws' (it's really not laws at this point but employment policy), if applied evenly to everyone in the current day, constitute as 'racist', as that seems to imply that certain demographics inherently must use more weed or something which in itself seems like kind of an outdated sterotype (basically, it kind of sounds like you're saying ""This policy is racist, because all black people smoke weed!!

But that's not quite right. Tuition is tied to the students, many other sources or not. For example, indirect cost recovery and state appropriations doesn't go up or down if student enrollment goes up or down. It might be more accurate to call them ""revenue"" per student instead of saying its what the University ""earns"" per student. I know it's a subtle difference.. .

The Gopher protocol is a TCP/IP application layer protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet. The Gopher protocol was strongly oriented towards a menu-document design and presented an alternative to the World Wide Web in its early stages, but ultimately Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) became the dominant protocol. The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web.The protocol was invented by a team led by Mark P. McCahill at the University of Minnesota.

Khan Academy includes lots of videos, readings, and practice problems to help you accomplish this.

It might \*seem\* doable, but the absolute last thing you want to have during your first semester of college is working about finishing your SI 106 project, studying for math 116, AND having to take your language proficiency exam, which spans multiple days. The amount of stress you'd be under is unimaginable. Even if your schedule was different, no first semester freshman should ever take 18 credits. I'd highly suggest either dropping 116 or 106, or putting off your language for a semester until you have a more open schedule.

Depending on the house you get, you either have a really small dorm building with like <30 people or a really big one. The dining hall, I really liked, it's self-serve and a quiet place during the day. It's packed on the weekends and game day, beware. It doesn't have too much variety, but I really liked it. Last year they had personal pizzas and lots of chicken tenders. The location, note that Oxford isn't even that far away from Central--a 15 min walk at most, it's just hidden. Plus you have your own bus. You live by South University so you have a lot of things to do as well. You also live literally across from the Arb so that's great. The rooms were small to me so it depends. Don't expect a big room unless you're assigned one. The people are friendly, if not, just quiet or keep to themselves. When I was at Oxford, I got air conditioning and heating so I was lucky. Laundry was fine, just don't rely on the quarter machine. Use PayRange or quarters out of pocket. That's all that I can think of. The bus and dining hall were my favorite things tho--the Oxford bus takes you to State St., Shapiro, North, and East Quad (and more) but that's all I needed, and the dining hall was nice. The computer lab is in West Seeley. Vending machines can be found in I think North Vandy (?)--the building with the Community Center--and in West Seeley.

The first wave of the application is the written portion; unless you raise red flags that early on, you get interviewed. The big things you have to project are: absolute obedience, compassion, ""leadership,"" and literacy in the social-justice-sphere (DEI, privilege, restorative justice, etc), ideally with some kind of \*demonstrated\* advocacy for those of marginalized identities (especially ones not your own). Be able to discuss potential marginalized identities you may have and, on the flip side, recognize your privileges.. . . . In terms of actually being an RA, your experience can vary heavily relative to your placement. The dynamics of your building, the building staff, and the random factors of who is in your hall can create very distinctive experiences of res-staff compared to those of friends in other buildings and halls. Housing has a strict policy about being your highest priority, second only to enrolled courses, and will absolutely jerk you around if you have anything that would conflict with RA shenanigans (desk shifts, Monday Night Meetings 6pm-8pm, or any of the ""alternative programming"" they force you to put on or around any big events).

I think people tend to highlight what they focused on the most as what was most important, but these things were not necessarily what made them get higher grades. I wouldn't recommend going through 280 again. Unlike most things in CS, 281 doesn't really build off of previous material too much.. . Also, I strongly discourage getting the CLRS book others mention. It's extremely dense and focuses a lot on proofs, which makes it a good reference book for a researcher, NOT a good learning textbook for a student. There are loads of videos online about all the 281 DS/Algos and I'd recommend those way more.. . You will do fine on the projects. The median score for them is always very high. They will take a lot of time, but will not give you any edge, grade wise. Your grade in the class is basically entirely determined by your test grades. I would say you should really, really understand Big-O notation. Every time you learn a new algorithm and it's implementation, you should be quizzing yourself on its space and runtime complexity. If you ever don't understand the complexity of something, you should FIND OUT WHY. During the class, you should strive to understand pretty much what any algorithm you learn is actually doing. The exception here is Union-Find, which you really don't need to understand at all and can memorize complexity for.. . There is also some STL knowledge involved. I personally find this a bit annoying, because sometimes it can make or break you in a free response question. If you can give a detailed, correct answer to the following question (using online C++ references is encouraged), I think you should be fine:. . You have a std::set<int> called s and an int x that you want to look for in the set, and you are given two lines of code.. . std::lower_bound(s.begin(), s.end(), x);. s.lower_bound(s.begin(), s.end(), x);. .

Since the slides typically had pseudocode or even C++ code for all of the algorithms, I found it was helpful to run the algorithms by hand on some sample inputs. I think that was especially helpful for topics like sorting, heaps, and trees, where we were expected to understand a lot of implementation details on the exam.. .

This teaches intro Python and intro C++. For CS-ENG, your intro course is ENGR 101 or 151. These teach intro MATLAB and intro C++, with 151 being an accelerated/advanced version mainly for people with prior experience.. . The general impression I have been able to gather is that people generally think EECS 183 is a ""better"" or more fun intro class. Python experience is much more useful to a CS student than MATLAB usually, and people just seem to think that 183 is a much better put together class. But again, I'm in engineering, so maybe it's just a sort of ""grass is always greener"" effect. Either intro class will treat you just fine - I very much enjoyed ENGR 151.. . Aside from this it basically comes down to the core requirements and potential slight money savings between the two colleges. You have to do core requirements no matter what, so what do you think you'll enjoy (or at least tolerate) more? Writing, language, liberal arts? If so, go with LSA. If you're like me and would rather just do more analytical science and engineering classes like physics , chem, etc, go with engineering.. . Lastly, there is a slight cost advantage to LSA depending on when you declare. Base LSA tuition is cheaper than base engineering tuition, but when you declare CS-LSA you are bumped up to engineering tuition to eliminate that advantage. However you don't really need to officially declare until a few semesters in.. . Hope all that helps!",18.0,neutral,0.7237869501113892

t1_et9b0sj,2019-07-08 13:20:36,t1_et991a0,t3_cakek8,"Absolutely!. . I don't know how electives specifically work for CS-LSA but you are not limited to just one elective on a semester or degree basis.. . Basically how it works is you have certain degree requirements that you must complete, either with specific courses (ENGR 101/EECS 183, the calculus sequence, EECS 280 & 281... et cetera) or by completing a certain credit amount of applicable courses. For example you have things like upper-level CS electives, flexible technical electives, general electives (literally anything), intellectual breadth electives... that sort of thing. They're all ""electives"" in that you choose what courses you'll be taking to fulfill the requirements. . . In college your scheduling is technically entirely up to you. You are the one deciding what classes to take, building your schedule, and making sure requirements get fulfilled. You will be meeting with advisors from both your college of choice and EECS to help you figure out what you need to do and what classes are good options to take, and your first semester usually isn't very flexible, but you are the one calling the shots. If you wanted to do a semester of entirely elective courses, entirely EECS courses, etc... you can do that, the registration is up to you.. . And sure, always happy to talk about campus safety! UofM is generally a very happy, safe place to be. UofM has their own campus security, known as DPSS, and they are usually very helpful and kind people. They are the ones who respond to campus issues, handle dorm and building security... that sort of thing. Ann Arbor Police Department, AAPD, also has plenty of presence in the area. I have not encountered any sort of situation in Ann Arbor yet where I felt legitimately unsafe or in danger, not to say that others haven't because they have, but it is relatively uncommon.. . When you get to orientation, there will be plenty of presentations on campus safety resources, procedures... etc. DPSS sends out crime alert emails whenever a significant criminal event happens, such as a break-in, assault, or similar. Aside from that, general safety advice applies. Watch the roads carefully when crossing or walking along streets, try not to walk alone at night, don't show off valuables... that kind of stuff. . . One specific Ann Arbor safety related thing you may not have experienced yet is the rampant panhandling issue in Ann Arbor. If you are unaware, panhandling is basically people on the street begging for money or trying to get cash ""donations"" for a cause that probably doesn't exist. These people are usually not dangerous to you or anyone else and they often do mean well, but they can be persistent and sometimes a bit aggressive. The best way to deal with it is to just ignore them and go quickly on your way, with headphones if possible. Beyond that it's your decision if you'd like to give any money to someone - one alternative my family likes to use is seeing if a homeless person or panhandler could use a care package of food and hygiene supplies. As always if you ever feel uncomfortable or threatened do not be afraid to call DPSS/AAPD or ask someone around you for help.. . Hope that all helps, always happy to answer questions!",8.0,error,0.0

Even as someone who leans hard to the left, it frustrates me deeply, especially because (as you alluded to) that approach just winds up hurting and alienating people who, at the very least, weren't knowingly acting in bad faith.. . I think that being mindful of social justice (/non-discrimination/egalitarianism/etc.) is an essential part of being a good person--hence its inclusion in your curriculum--but I believe that's because they fall under the umbrella of standing up for others even when that comes at a cost to oneself.
