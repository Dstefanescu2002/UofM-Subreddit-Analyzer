Another thing to note is that there are regulations about high school students on campus.. . The faculty has to have a current background check on file (when I worked with high school students I had to have one annually), which would also apply to any grad students that will be in close working proximity to the student (I know for sure this is for in-person and for organized virtual programs, but may also apply for remote individual students). If it is a (non-computational) lab, there is also occupational safety issues that can be complicated with someone less than 18.. . In person research for HS students is suspended due to the pandemic - as of a month ago, perhaps this has changed, or varies by college.. . As others have pointed out, there is no shortage of undergrads available for research, so the bar on high school students can be a bit higher.. . Specific answers to your questions:. . 1) look at the faculty listing for the departments you are interested in or seem relevant. . . 2) In my experience very few faculty take HS students. That I know of, a very small sample, the HS students that do engage in research tend to have some connection that was developed previous, for instance participation in a summer program geared for HS students, or have something compelling about themselves (e.g., prior exposure to the problem, under-represented background, from nationally ranked STEM HS). Time is limited, and every HS student taken on diverts attention to a current UM grad or undergrad, which our primary mission.. . 3) Relevant courses or knowledge is important. I'm computational, so having programming is critical for me. The skills will depend on the area.

To address your question about disregarding this stuff moving forward, the honest answer (that I am now free to give) is you really can forget *most* (not all) of what 370 taught you about assembly instructions/execution if you don't really care about low-level stuff. Having a general familiarity with what assembly language is and how it differs from high-level programming languages is important as this stuff tends to come up again and again later on, but remembering the nitty-gritty details of how a multi-cycle processor functions, what caller/callee saving is, the specifics of the object files and how they're used in linking, all that is probably never going to become relevant again for you.. . Now, if you do plan on taking classes/pursuing work with compilers or operating systems or something like that, then this stuff I just mentioned is important. If you're more focused on really high level stuff then you probably won't ever see a multi-cycle/pipeline processor ever again.. .

Technically, the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) is in charge of the investigation into any allegations against faculty. They end up making the final report/decision which departments/schools are bound by. However, CSE could have done more in this case to protect the students. For example, making undergrads aware of allegations. It's a tough decision to make on when to take action (what if the allegations turned out false?) but in this case, there seemed to be enough evidence to prioritize students. It isn't clear though just how much CSE leadership knew, since OIE is the one doing the full investigation and they aren't as transparent. Fwiw, few trust OIE these days (both faculty and students) and they mostly serve to protect the university; this sentiment is shared towards most university's OIEs from what I've heard.. . >Is Dr. Guzdial apart of any of this mess? He is the one prof i would be interested in being my advisor. . Guzdial is one of many fantastic student-focused faculty at CSE and has been very vocal arguing for students in this mess. It's not all terrible too, though this is a wake-up call for the whole culture to change (to put it lightly). Many faculty care a lot about students and are pushing for this change. For example, Wes Weimer recently became the chair of the CSE Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee in the dept (a new position) and Rada Mihalcea just landed a big grant to support women in computing. . . That said, as a PhD student, reach out to folks in labs that you're interested in and get the real story.

I don't know much about dual program, but am getting ready to apply to law school myself. . . M law is in the T14 law schools, meaning a lot of people want to go here (16% acceptance rate). And at least 75% of those accepted have above the 90th percentile on the LSAT (164ish) and above a 3.56 undergrad GPA. . . There are people that do four years of undergrad planning on law school, study for the lsat for a year and still don't get into M law. So while I don't think it's impossible for you, but if you just study the lsat for a month and apply on a whim you probably won't have a great chance. . . The 10 years WE is the best part of your application, so if you're serious about this you should probably put a couple months into getting a good lsat and talk about your work in the personal statements.

You must take ECON 101 and 102, an intro social science course (such as POLSCI 111, 140, or 160 or INTLSTD 101), and a Race and Ethnicity course before applying. You should also take MATH 115 and 116 (calculus 1 /2), although it's not required. You can't take any public policy major courses other than STATS 250 before you're enrolled at Ford, and I would recommend taking stats before you enroll. Otherwise, fill your distribution as much as possible and finish your language requirement in your first two years since the LSA distribution requirements still apply.. . 2. There's a lot here. Experience in political orgs (publications, campaigns, debate team, model UN, etc.), a high GPA (shoot for above 3.7-3.8), high grades in related courses, course selection that matches your interests, and good reasoning for wanting to pursue a policy degree are all taken into account. They also heavily weigh essays, so you have to communicate your interests very well there.. . 3. You can pursue a lot of careers as it's a very interdisciplinary degree. You can work in the private sector in research orgs (i.e. think tanks) or in policy positions in corporations. There's also a lot of government work you can do with the degree. . . 4. I haven't started courses yet, but Ford has excellent career services and networking opportunities.

If this is the case, then I would say that you shouldn't avoid taking hard math courses since your major is going to be composed of mostly this anyway. I speak from experience since I took calc 3 as dual enrollment in highschool. I took it at Henry Ford Community College, and I can tell you that the calc 3 knowledge I have today did not come from there. Hell, even a C student in Math 215 is equivalent to an A+ at Henry Ford Communtiy college. If I did not teach my self the material before going into my higher level engineering and math class, I would've ended up doing poorly.

I've been seeing my therapist for maybe 4 years now and learning ways to stay grounded that help. I've had a stable job and relationship for about as long. I'm 31 now. . .

As others have said, single dorms are rare and its low odds that you get one. But it's always possible.. . I would, however, not recommend going for a single. For a few reasons.. . 1. Unless your family is wealthy or you have passive income, at some point you will have to share a bedroom. Might as well learn now. It really isn't that bad and even at Michigan, you'll save 200-300 dollars a month sharing a bedroom. Convince your parents to let you buy takeout or outrageous expensive Michigan gear from MDen (seriously don't shop there).. 2. Living with someone else has advantages... and disadvantages, but both are useful. You'll have an easier time connecting with others in the hall, can have people over (for sober events *Don't be ridiculous this is a dry campus*) and someone to rant about school with/become best friends with. If you hate them, then it sucks! But it's a great experience for living with roommates/housemates in future years even if you have your own bedroom in those places.. 3. More open dorm options. If you want a single there are only a few dorms that have them and they're rare. In North Quad, West Quad, Oxford, etc there are 5 people suites that provide a living room and have 4-5 people in them. It's a nice way to have a cute little home with a TV and actual space and have roommates while not getting ripped off. I would recommend looking into that maybe?. . I suppose it comes down to why do you want to be in a single? If you have concerns about roommates/sharing space I'd suggest sharing a room. If it's something personal that you don't want to put on Reddit (understandable) then go for the single or try and talk to housing :).. . Hope this helps!

I was a knockout high school kid, nailed a 3.8ish at UM-Flint, and transferred in my junior year. Meaning I had only \~3 years of upper levels to try and salvage a GPA at 2.1 after 2 semesters. I worked my ass off to a 3.0, and got a job walking out of uni (EE). Trust me that this is NOT the end of the world. . . Instead of overly describing my path (which is not helpful cause everyone is different), I'll share what gave me perspective when I was hurting and how I rebuilt.. . 1. take care of yourself. MOST important. don't beat yourself up for what happened, we are our own worst critics.. 2. get admin help within Umich. CAPS at BBB hooked me up with a terrific resource to find a therapist and walk me though ALL the administrative stuff to make sure I was gonna not only avoid suspension, but walk out of that place with the thousand-dollar piece of paper and head held high. I know it can be tough to reach out after not communicating with your advisor; just remember they've seen this before, probably worse, and chances are want to see you succeed.. 3. engage your community. being alone can intensify the funks; even if it's just outside in a crowd (well a covid safe one), human interaction is so important.. 4. put your brain to work in something you enjoy. when I flunked EECS 270 and 203, I took the next semester to do only one EECS class and the rest music courses, with the idea of doing PAT-D at SMTD. That didn't end up working out, but I did discover an EECS path that tied together what I loved with what I studied so I could hold strong to the finish.. 5. get some space. I got to study abroad toward the end, which was a miracle frankly, but any movement to a new landscape or horizon does wonders for our perspective. for me, it was a major turning point to getting my mojo back.. . When it comes to worrying about jobs, you do have to be realistic that someone may cock their head at an iffy GPA. Thankfully, cover letters give you opportunity to tell your story. It sounds like you're already reengaging your curiosity and channeling into work, which is a big part of that too. And if your resume gets chucked aside from someone only looking at one number, then that's the recruitment team's failure and not yours because we are more than numbers.. .

My hardest semesters by far had 2 CS classes and 1 math/science class, so I would advise against this if I were you. The way to go, imo, is to get as many math/science classes out of the way at other schools as possible - physics and chem are a lot of work at UMich, and the math department can be downright sadistic. Take summer school calc (although if you're starting at 1 you probably can't take all your necessary math elsewhere), take physics at washtenaw community college during the semester in place of a few credits, study abroad (lol) and do your physics there. You don't gain anything by doing these classes at UMich.. . Also, I'll nitpick you a bit and say that it isn't really true students do 4 courses a semester - or at least, I don't think you should think like that. College courses have a number of credits which is a good (but not perfect) indicator of the time commitment and workload they'll expect of you. So figure out how many credits you need at UMich to graduate (128 is the COE baseline but you may have some AP credit), divide by the number of semesters you want to be in school for, and that's a good average to shoot for each semester. For me, I only had to average 14 credits a semester, meaning sometimes I took three 4-credit classes, sometimes I took 4 courses which weren't all 4-credits (and thus may have been easier), and just generally had more flexibility when planning.. .

I use an ipad myself so I can't just pull up my bank statement for this, but most of the people I know use some sort of fancy paper like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Loose-Filler-Paper-Ruled-Sheets/dp/B07F64TZ3K/ref=asc_df_B07F64TZ3K/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=242025726886&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13505307673568916035&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016852&hvtargid=pla-474610671506&psc=1) one. If we go by your calculations that's 40\*70=2800 sheets total (which is honestly low balling it for most stem students but wtv). The paper I linked is $20 per 400 sheets, and 2800/400=7, so that's 20\*7=$140. So 140 just for paper alone. Now we need to account for the binders. Assuming people use multiple binders and reuse them, I'm just gonna throw in $30 for all 40 classes, making it $170 total.. . Next, there's no way the average UM student ONLY uses pencils. That's straight wild. Most people use pens for notes, and pens run out pretty quick (not to mention all the different colored pens, highlighters, and pencil/pen erasers/white-outs). A decent pen costs around $1-$2, and if we account for refills and all the other stuff that's around $5 per class for writing utensils. 40 classes means 40\*5 = $80 total. That adds up to 170+80=$250.. . An ipad is $329 like you said so the difference is only around $80. However, the fact that with an ipad you 1. don't have to carry notebooks everywhere 2. have a much lighter backpack 3. Can annotate directly on the lecture slides 4. basically have an extra monitor to study/work... etc more than makes up for the price difference.. . I'm not even gonna get into how much easier it is to organize notes on an ipad than physical notebooks.. . In conclusion, while yes, using an ipad is gonna be slightly more expensive than just taking notes on paper, IF you're financially okay with spending that extra bit of money an ipad is 100% worth it.. . Edit: I actually made a wrong calculation so I guess i proved your point xd. 40\*5=200. So total price should actually be 170+200 = $370.

The kinds of students who end up at places like UM tend to follow that pattern (and may have tunnel vision about it) but in fact that mode is not set in stone anywhere. . . FWIW, I think the experience of failing and bouncing back makes you a very compelling future job candidate. I do not hire in finance or tech, I'll grant you that, but I think you can make it a powerful story down the road.

That fall was too heavy for me personally, coming from a rural school that didn't prepare people to go to college 'cus it wasn't exactly common, so I decided to drop Math105 so I could handle the classes I did keep and also have more time to meet people and enjoy, y'know, being a human at UMich and all.. .

I can see why you would say ""can easily fall behind here but there's tons of resources available if I seek them out."" Like any big and rigorous school you have to have more initiative than a smaller school in a lot of cases. For example, getting to know a professor in a class of 25 at a small private school is vastly different to the same task with 300+ students. It's not a bad thing overall because everyone benefits from learning how to take initiative as an adult (ex. Applying to some jobs will be super competitive and you need to know how to stand out, ask for help etc). These are valuable skills with a learning curve (freshman year) where you trial and error what works for you, what you want to develop and most importantly coming to terms with your own limits and how to ask for help. It's humbling but it helps a lot later on speaking from experience. I went to a very small high school, graduated valedictorian and came to Michigan and struggled initially with how to accomplish my goals and the same level of academic and professional performance people have always had in mind for me (and that I had for myself). It took learning to go to office hours in some cases to visiting my honors counselor in others and to speaking even to upperclassmen to help out when I was really stumped. What some people mean by that sentiment or phrase is that, and this is VERY dependent on your major and career path, you will not get help unless you ask for it or look for it.

A question like this is legitimate because we're all raring to form everlasting bonds with people while we're here at Michigan. We have been dealing with Covid at the university for a year and a half now, so finding a good answer to this question is important for people who are feeling deprived of proper human interaction. Don't doubt yourself. . . . I will be entirely clear and let you know that I do not have a solid friend group at Michigan yet, and I'm now a junior, so you're not alone in this feeling. However, I have found one method that can work towards establishing or finding yourself into a good friend group. Stop trying to form a group at once and instead focus on individual people. I would say that it is more important to form strong bonds on an individual level before you start trying to form a group. Once you know a few people, if you think they'd all get along and have a good time, you can try and propose something to do together to introduce everybody to each other. I cannot give a success rate or anything because that is such a variable decision. However, sometimes it only takes one person. If you have a good bond with somebody, they might introduce you to their group of friends and you could be accepted in just fine. . . . Human interaction is hard to define for how to make friends because some of it falls upon you, and you are the only one who knows yourself well. Here's my advice: be genuine. Don't worry about forming a friend group yet because we're in a very exceptional period. Be yourself and try and meet people you think are interesting by doing things you find cool. Also, stop comparing yourself to your sister. They are an entirely different person with different motivations and personality from you. I'm the youngest of five, so I understand that it is easy to compare yourself to siblings and what they did or were at during a certain period of life, but you have to realize that what works for them may not work for you. Take each moment slowly and enjoy them, and be yourself. When I stopped and accepted that, I did start to make a couple new friends during this last semester, even with Covid.

Every four years the whole group turns over and you don't have history with almost anyone.**. . I didn't make a close friend group in undergrad. I had some club/activity groups and some people I met in the dorms but no ""best friends."" I think that's normal. In adulthood, those friends become much more rare. The transition to that stage of life where you have more acquaintances and less close friends is hard, but it's just part of growing up. . . Treasure the relationships you have and try not to let the relationships you don't have get in the way of that. I found a group of close friends in grad school, but now they're all moving away. I'm grateful to have them, sad our friendship will change, and accepting of the fact that adulthood is hard. . . Just my 2 cents as an alum who never found that group in undergrad.

Essentially, it is the standard at American universities to award Latin honors for cumulative gpa, and additional English designations for honors programs and other achievements. I'm not aware of any college where ""cum laude"" honors indicate completion of advanced honors coursework.. . Michigan differs only in that it uses English for both designations, because it's a public school and because James B.

I've heard that it can be slightly more work than other sections, but it is still much less than what you would expect from a 4-credit class. . . The class is NOT an EECS class. You are not required to implement any of the algorithms from scratch, you just need to know how to use the scikit-learn interface. The class places little emphasis on the math behind ML, which it cannot do anyways since most people have not taken Math 214 and 215. . .

Course has potential and I want to like it but as it currently stands I cannot completely recommend it. It's hard to say how much of this was just the lack of polish from the pilot offering that may be corrected this semester but here are my main warnings: . . The technical communication portion is a nightmare with Bowden teaching. There were far too many TC assignments and this left barely enough time to do the final project. I'd say about half the teams didn't really even have a working final project because of this. His grading is extremely arbitrary and unfair. The memo format is completely illogical and very difficult to frame the labs in but Bowden will insist you follow his rubric to the letter. On the other hand, you may lose 20-30% of your grade off a memo for expectations which never even showed up on the rubric at all. Later labs didn't even have rubrics. Deadlines and requirements for the class shifted around frequently or were added spontaneously.. . On the technical side, the M-Bot labs can be fun, although the actual technical content is basic so it's likely you've seen a lot of it if you were exposed to engineering in high school. My understanding though is that this is normal for all ENG 100 sections. . . However, one thing to know (this could be good or bad, depends on how you feel) is the course does not really live up to the name of robotic mechanisms. There is far more instructional time spent on simple electronics and intro to C programming than mechanical design. In fact, there is really only one lab covering anything even close to mechanisms: in lab 1 you are expected to learn CAD from a solidworks video tutorial playlist where you CAD a lamp. Other than that, there is just the final project which ironically was less work/time than some of the labs. There was no machine shop or manufacturing portion of the course, although this may have been due to COVID-19 restrictions.. . If you ignore the tech comm issues, I think the course probably needs another 1-2 semesters to really flush out all of the problems and design more compelling content/labs involving mechanisms. I think at that point this will be a great section, but for now your time might be better spent on something that's more developed.",2.0,negative,0.6062836050987244

t1_h177pcj,2021-06-09 20:47:14,t3_nstu8x,t3_nstu8x,"Alright, here goes nothing :. . I'm a very poor first gen student from a very poor and republican suburb halfway between A2 and Detroit. The extent my parents know of college is that it's, ""the best years of your life! You'll be making 6 figures when you graduate!!!!"" This is, very obviously (to most college students and graduates), not true. College is hell and I'll be lucky to make 30k after graduating, maybe moving that up to 40 or 50k after a few years. Almost everything that I've done, I've done on my own--from discovering AP classes to filling out college apps and finding fee waivers, to filing my own damn taxes and inputting my parents' financial stuff. Registering classes, dorms, apartment leases, utilities, tackling insurance and medical problems in my life, almost entirely on my own with frantic googling and many late nights. It is hell doing literally everything on my own, on top of classes, on top of working part-time, on top of an abusive family that expects you ""home"" every weekend; on top of previously undiagnosed adhd, autism, social anxiety disorder, depression, and ptsd that you were gaslit your entire life into thinking were normal, frequent migraines and IBS, and no accommodations. Then there's... Pandemic. . . In my experience, lots of kids here don't have a lot of those responsibilities. They have their parents tackling financial stuff, giving them allowances, etc. Or at the very least their parents are helpful regarding their health if it's an issue, or they'd gone to college or done research to know what to expect for their kid. Known how all of the processes worked, or figured it out for them. Their only concerns are their grades and securing good research positions or internships, or maybe some drama with friends, roommates, or dating life.. . Lots of people can't handle the academic and performance stresses here, let alone anything or everything else. Lots of people also don't know how to ask for help because they've never needed it before or got by without it. Lots of people also don't know how to not overwork themselves into burnout every semester.. . That being said, there are resources here. For all of this. I was put into SuccessConnects with the multicultural office freshman year and I think it helped me a great deal. I didn't know how to ask for help, let alone what kind of help to ask for and from whom and when. They helped with that a little, but can only do so much when you don't even know all the problems you have that you need help with.. . It took me three years, living in another country, and a pandemic to be able to realize how badly I was doing and that I needed to reach out to disability services and to genuinely reach out to mental health professionals--not one CAPS and done or seeing a UHS psychiatrist that doesn't really listen to your concerns. I fought with my insurance for months, calling therapy and psych testing places all across the state trying to find one that was open and took my insurance. CAPS isn't suitable for students with big mental health cases like mine so it wasn't really an option, though I did speak with their social worker to help connect me to the help I needed who,,, literally could only tell me everything I already knew while also telling me ""wow I'm so surprised you know all this because most students don't"". I also had absolutely no idea that you didn't need actual documentation of a disability to speak with their services and see if they could help, which I wish I would've known sooner. I hardly used office hours and rarely spoke with professors--didn't want to ask for extra help or extensions, turned in so many things late or not at all. Failed about 14cdts worth of classes. Too scared, too shy, too socially-dumb, and too stubborn and frustrated at not being able to do it all myself like before. I, fortunately, have all the trauma and the privilege of being eldest daughter aka did everything for everyone all of the time and often didn't have parents to help, so I was quite familiar with frantic googling and late nights prior to college. It just got a little harder because I was so used to taking care of everyone else I had no idea how to take care of myself. And, of course, I have copious amounts of mental health issues and happen to be from a family that doesn't believe in the concept of mental health. . . So that's what it means to be a ""sink or swim"" school--you either have your arm floaties or you're viciously doggy paddling while being waterboarded like me, or you drown and drop out. Do yourself a favor and get your floaties before your senior year. -someone with experience",1.0,error,0.0

Most people's impression of the Math department is from Calc 1-4 sequence and it's definitely not all like that. In the upper-level classes, the professors are super personable and really cool. The miss part of the equation is assistant profs. They lack tenure which means less pay/job security.

I had to listen to people freaking out about getting a 100 vs a FUCKING 97 on projects. When I asked them why they freaked out so much about that, they said ""It's so I don't worry about just passing like you, no offense."" When I tried to reach out to peers, expressing how lost / anxious / panicked I was, some people gave some helpful advice, I also got people just reminding me if I couldn't figure EECS 280 out, I wasn't going to survive EECS 281. Gee, thanks, no shit. I was surrounded by people who seriously procrastinated and still, just, did well. They were stressed out during the 10 hours they speedran the project, but they could do it. My deteriorating mental health ass? I could not. I spent 6 hours a day, and all weekend on these projects, and still failed them due to shit mental health.. . The whole ""You cant share your codes with others to ask for help or for any other reason"", sure it makes sense since they tend not to change projects every other year but you feel all the more isolated and siloed with tough projects. People nudge you to do projects you can partner up with on your own as it will prepare you better for future classes where you can't partner up. Unless you're actually good at coding coming in, just don't do this. Otherwise you'll get shamed like me when you can't fucking figure it out on your own.. . I finally managed to do a Lab in 1 hour one week when it usually took me a whole day due to back then undiagnosed ADHD to do a lab. Got somebody reminding me how easy this class was when I tried celebrating. Someone stood up for me which felt really nice. Still sucks to have to deal with that though.

I don't get how people can do these projects on their own or speedrun them because for me they were an ongoing assignment that I had to consistently be working on. I had virtually no experience with coding coming into uofm and while engr101 was not bad for me, eecs280 felt like I skipped a class in between engr101 to get to it. Just difficult all around. I don't know how I could have done stuff like euchre etc by myself and even with a partner I didn't do very well on it. And like you mention, people encourage u to do it by yourself but it has never seemed doable to me with ~16 credits courseload, and other responsibilities. . I also agree that the honor code system could be improved upon. With long queues (I mean, the whole thing with ""starting early"" is that even though I did that every time, I still found myself working on the project up till the deadline), and piazza posts are just not the same, it just feels like ur stuck sometimes with nowhere to go. sometimes I feel like ""man, this issue in my code I'm having could have been an extremely quick fix if only someone could look over it"" but with limited staff resources to look over the issue u can only do so much. I wish there was some sort of system where students could help each other out (maybe in a proctored zoom call or something idk) where you know that another student is done with the project or something and has nothing to earn from helping u debug a part of your code. I mean there's group office hours but I rarely used them because I was having specific questions about a line in my code and those group office hours were only for conceptual questions. Idk. Feels like there's room for improvement. . I don't know how much of this in my comment is necessarily ""toxicity"" since it doesn't really involve other people being negative or toxic(which is an extremely unfortunate thing u had to experience) but moreso things I feel could be improved upon in the department. Guess I just wanted to get it out of my system lol. . . Curious, did you take your eecs classes in person? I started my eecs courses later than usual, and everything was online by then. I wonder if people's experiences vary when u can put a picture to a name. I think I would feel so intimidated going to office hours all day if I were in-person and would feel like I'm a ""regular,"" whereas in online office hours, I'm just an anonymous person behind a name, so it doesn't feel so intimidating.

Basically, a college degree is nothing more but a very expensive signal you get to signal to employers that you are a competent and capable worker, which exists as a construct due to the inherent information asymmetry where potential employees have more information on how good a worker they are than the employer. Thus, a college degree serves primarily as a way for employers to more quickly find the competent, peach workers and filter out the incompetent/lazy, lemon workers. . . The practical applicability of every discipline is really questionable (unless you go into academia). CS majors aren't utilizing probably 75%+ of their education outside of interview prep. No doctor is gonna actually be solving chemical equations like the ones from their orgo class once they start practicing. Same goes with the econ degree, where no job is actually gonna use much of the theory and mathematical modeling you do in class.. . On a broader level, the main help I got from the degree was the thinking process in that most of the econ classes require you to abstract what you learned in theory onto applicable examples, and thinking through that process helps a lot in the workplace. It also helped with discipline I think. The econ classes at UM aren't particularly hard, some of them just give you a lot of work and info at once but if you take the time to go through it every class is a pretty easy A/A-.

The season ticket price for each is a steal compared to going to each game individually. If you are a more so-so sports fan or are unsure if you'll like one then maybe only get football and one of the others. You can always buy tickets to the one you don't have and unless it's a super big game you can probably expect to find a student ticket for ~$30 max. . . I will add that each has there own pros and cons. Basketball can feel more important as it's much more popular to the general campus population. But if you want the bleacher seats right behind the benches it's become impossible unless you are willing to get up at 6am to go get a wristband and then get to Crisler Center 2 hours before tip-off.

Discussions are super important, especially if math isn't super intuitive for you (it isn't for me, so working with my GSI every week was a total Godsend). 351 covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. I carved out 2+ hours a day to study and the units where I didn't keep up with that schedule, I did not do satisfactory on the exams. I did have Dr. Nolta for biochem, so exams were super difficult, but her explanations were mostly really good and I would rewatch the lectures twice. YouTube videos (I prefer Professor Dave Explains and the Organic Chemistry Tutor) were super helpful in enforcing different topics. I also made massive study guides on my iPad where I could search the material and I went over it multiple times over the course of a week before the exams. You're also returning to the electron pushing you learned in orgo so make sure to remember how to do that.. . I have not taken analytical chem but I have done most of my undergrad research focused on analytical instrumentation. Brush up on your stats. You'll need it. I am a massive nerd when it comes to analytical instruments and was a TA for a special intro chem lab course that focused heavily on analytical chemistry and how it's utilized in environmental research. I don't know the material for achem but as someone who taught instruments, it is super helpful to understand from the bottom up, ie: how do parts of an instrument work together to produce your analysis of interest?. . Hope this helps! Good luck!",1.0,positive,0.8342950344085693

Gainfully employed FTVM (well actually, Screen Arts and Cultures, but I'm old lol) female grad with MDD/SA (who has also frequently considered getting a psych related grad degree after graduating) here - are you time travelling me?. . Advice the first would be, consider working at a university when you graduate if you're still thinking about extending your time as a student or exploring other avenues. At the U of M (depending upon the school or department you'd work for or study in) you get extremely discounted (usually 75% off) tuition for credited classes (if you work for LSA and take LSA classes it's free). Also, you can also more easily negotiate your way into free audited classes as a staff person if you wanna just take a class and see if it's up your alley. I never took screenwriting classes in SAC as an undergrad and working for ISS (LSA tech services now) as an AV tech I was able to take a number of the classes I'd missed as a student. As a FTVM student you probably have some solid tech knowledge that would be directly applicable to being an AV Tech (a job that is frequently in demand at a wide range of colleges nation-wide). LSA in particular (and the U of M broadly) loves hiring grads, so if it seems up your alley I can't recommend that position/department highly enough. I'm one of them weirdos who is from ann arbor originally so it was easy enough for me to stick around after graduating and get a job at the U but since getting that job, I've been able to get multiple other AV Tech jobs at other colleges outside of Michigan so you could probably do the same elsewhere.. . Advice the second would be, there are a number of ways to be a psychologist and not all of them require going to medical school or even getting a PhD (although if you wanna be a psychiatrist there's really no avoiding it). The U of M's School of Social Work is currently assembling an online master's degree program which would actually get you to the point where you could at least start exploring options for either going the clinical route or going the research path for like a fraction of the regular tuition. Best part of the online degree is that because it'll be on Coursera, there's a high likelihood that there will be at least a number of courses in the degree that are auditable so you don't have to pay to try em and get a feel for things. . . . Anyway, you're in a terrifying moment in life, there's really no other way to put it, but honestly all that BS that the LSA recruiters always used to spout about the flexibility of having a humanities degree in getting a job is actually kind of true. You've probably gained a lot of skills to stretch yourself into all sorts of unexpected future paths if you'd like and you might be more skilled at it than a more specialized major would be.

I graduated high school with a 2.7, and I had a lot of false starts with college. I kept changing what I wanted to do because I would just lose interest or get frustrated and want something different.

Grad schools take that into account for your overall GPA. Sure you have a 3.2, but is it because you did poorly in your first few semesters/years? Or is it because you did poorly in the later classes? 2. Your personal statement is a fantastic place to talk about any factors that influence trends in your GPA. Its a good place where you can talk about things like finding out you had ADHD late in the game. Maybe that means you started off strong in school and had a decline as university got tougher.

Maybe it meant you couldn't do several different clubs or internships or volunteering while you did school because it takes you twice as long to do schoolwork as other leople... whatever it is, you can explain it in your personal statement/other essays (I think my MPH applications asked for an essay specifically to explain anomalies in GPA.). . . Your personal statement can also be used to explain your passion for the degree you're applying to. Thats what its there for, and it can help an application a lot.. . Finally. I highly recommend r/ADHD it can be a little bit of a drag sometimes as it can turn into a lot of downsides about ADHD. But its a great community to ask for advice and commiserate. r/ADHDmeme is also great to sort of laugh at the problems with having ADHD.

Everyone kind of seems like kids right now, but many of these kids will eventually move on to be leaders in their fields.. * Go to office hours. Talk to your professors. It will help a lot with your studies and save you time.. * Join societies and clubs related to your field if you think you have room. It's a great way to make connections.. * Keep in mind the average salary and job market competitiveness of graduates from each degree. The harder it is to find good jobs with a particular degree, the more pressure you will have to be perfect.

I have a couple things off the top of my head that I'd suggest, the first being to get to know everyone in your immediate circles. Just start talking to everyone in your classes and people you walk past in the dorms and see if you click with them. I made eight really good friends who were my dorm room neighbors and who I'm now going to be living in a house with this semester. I was living in Bursley, and we had a GroupMe gc setup which was nice 'cause other kids would try to arrange hangouts.. . Besides that, if you are an athletic person or enjoy sports, just hang around Palmer field at the tennis courts or the field/track. There's always people playing spike ball, frisbee, football or soccer over there. There's also a nice dining hall right next to it. . . Last thing I can think of; just walk around central and south campus if you have any free time. Keep in mind the week before classes start is going to be the most opportune time to meet people, since you're not going to be super busy. I would often hang out on campus with friends but you can easily go alone and have a good time. Oftentimes when I went alone, I would just find another big group of kids and approach them and just say, ""Hey I lost my group, do you guys mind if I chill with you for a while"", and stay with them long enough to get a couple numbers/snaps/ig contacts.

I'm going to take your question as more of a general one asking the difference between the two since you have never experienced an in-person lecture before. . . . Based on my experience, in-person classes are easier than online classes from a lot of different perspectives. First, we can take a look from a distraction standpoint. In an online class, it is entirely up to you to find an environment that is conducive to your learning; some of that is out of control (like other people who you are living with), but you may also have distractions from being on your computer or phone. That doesn't occur for in-person as much (there are exceptions) because it is easier to stay engaged with the material when the person who is lecturing is physically close to you. There's also the fatigue perspective. I don't know about you, but I always felt that there was a lull in content and I just could not stand watching a Zoom lecture, even if it was something that interested me. Since you will likely not be staring at a screen as much, that fatigue will be reduced. Finally, you can look at class engagement. In a larger lecture, you'll get some questions occasionally. That is definitely better than some online classes where you ask a question in the chat and it is either ignored or there is delay that causes transitions between questions and the rest of the content to be jarring. There are other differences I can point out, but I believe that those are the best ones to describe because they are the most apparent when you shift from in-person to online. . . . In terms of study habits, this is entirely class dependent. In most of my classes, my exams were open-note or open-book, which changes the game up a lot for studying because it is more of cramming information and knowing how to parse through it quickly. I will say that it is unlikely that this format will continue (though I am no expert), so you may have to find ways to remember more of the class information (I cannot speak to the specifics of Chem 210 as I am also going to be taking it next semester). My advice is to dedicate an hour or two at the end or beginning of the week to review what content was covered in class. Breaking your notes into smaller chunks makes it easier to remember and you can gain a lot of understanding of what you need to review more if you take the time to do so. Other than that, do not underestimate office hours. Go if you are unsure of something. Go if you want to know what other people are struggling with. You will notice your understanding of material increase if you devote a little extra time going to office hours. I realized that in one of my classes later than I should have, which resulted in me having to try harder to get the grade I wanted.",4.0,error,0.0

Craigslist is where you'll find the private sellers hyperlocally, but be very wary of what you find privately on websites where it's all but free to post (CL, FB). Most of these off brand scooters are but one bad pothole from misaligning or outright breaking a driveline and one winter from rusting to the point of having innumerable electrical issues with bad grounds. . . You will most certainly not want to use a major dealer in the area (FreeRide Powersports) for maintenance for a couple reasons - 1) they are way west of town and 2) it'll be well over one hundred dollars to do an oil change and once over of the vehicle. Plus, most of these shops have huge service backlogs meaning they hold your bike for awhile anyway. My suggestion would be to learn to do the basic maintenance yourself. Many scooters have belt drives which are basically free from maintenance for thousands of miles. The oil and filters are the only big issue besides just checking that other things like brakes are still functional.

Another thing is that if you have the money, you can get the nicer model (honda ruckus) use it for a couple years, and still sell it for close to the value that you bought it. I bought mine for close to 2k and will definitely be able to sell it for $1500 which $500 spent for 3 years is definitely worth it in my book.. .

Let me tell you right now 2 wheels are absolutely not safe for when there is snow on the road. That being said most of the winter months it's not actively snowing on the ground so it's fine to ride. Riding the moped however gets fucking cold from the windchill so you'll have to invest in some headwear and a good wind blocking coat to keep you warm or a helmet (if you're riding this in the winter wear a damn helmet). . .

t1_h3bv5y7,2021-06-28 15:24:22,t1_h3bnwie,t3_o9gkc6,"You'd definitely need a cover for the bike. If you're living on campus, that means your bike will almost certainly be exposed to the elements 24/7. The bike racks of Ann Arbor are filled with the rusting carcasses of bikes their owners decided to stop giving a shit about. Bike chains and gears take the weather the hardest -- rain and snow from above, salt water slush from below. Ofc, electric bikes don't strictly need chains or gears, and chains are cheap enough to be sacrificial. The electric parts of an ebike aren't designed to be soaked. You can do some amatuer waterproofing on the LCD with a sandwich bag and a rubber band, and the controller and rear wheel can take heavy rain, but the connectors for the cables (not the motor cable, but the control cables) aren't always up to the elements. Those get stashed in a saddle bag or something, offering some protection, but don't let that bag soak through and then plug the battery in. Alternatively, get a waterproof case for the controller and connectors. I also wouldn't plug the battery into a wet connector (another reason to leave the battery and connector in your backpack and connect it while the backpack is in the rear rack).. . In terms of getting your bike stolen, there are 4 methods I use to avoid that. . . . 1) Make it look crappy. Minimize the resale value -- you can even paint them really gaudy colors (this is called dazzle) -- who'd buy a bright purple, roughly painted used bike? My bike intentionally looks like a hodgepodge of wires, zip ties, and tape. You can make a bike look shittier by zip tying a milk crate to the rear rack (convenient space for books and backpacks, even the battery). The battery on an ebike is the most visible and expensive piece (sometimes more expensive than the rest of the bike combined), so you definitely want to take it off every time you lock it up. Nowadays, I just keep mine in my backpack in the milk crate -- it's top-heavy, but it hides the fact it's an ebike from people who don't know much about ebikes. Even if they could tell it was one, the bike is a hodgepodge, worth much less than a preassembled, brand-name ebike.. . . 2) Use U-locks -- multiple. As small as you can reliably use with the local bike racks. Get two: one to lock the rear wheel (2nd most expensive element on the bike) + frame, and a second to lock the frame and front wheel. Any lock can be cut -- u-locks make it harder, you need an angle-grinder and time. The goal isn't to be impossible to steal, it's to be more bothersome and less rewarding to steal. Any bike can be stolen, so don't own the bike they choose. High quality u-locks cost a lot, so I use 2 cheaper ones -- the thief might know how to defeat one, but will they want to invest enough time in the other?. . . 3) Get an alarm. Sometimes they come with locks, but the cheapest ones get zip tied under your bike seat and have little keychain remotes like cars do. They beep when they detect vibration, hopefully scaring off the thief. They're also fun to remotely trigger from across the street when people walk past. They also make your bike easier to find, like a car's clicker in a parking lot.. . . 4) Park next to better-looking and easier to steal bikes. If your ebike looks like shit, and some rich kid's brand new thousand-dollar road bike is locked up with a weak lock, park your bike next to that bike. Chances are, the thief will decide your ancient piece of junk (which they might not even realize is electric) would be more complicated to steal and sell than a pretty, new high-school graduation present.",2.0,error,0.0

Weeder classes are most of the pre-requisite classes for your major sadly. You're CS so you're going to be looking at the introductory calculus sequence + discrete math, physics, the coding courses (although the first one, EECS 183 does a fantastic job at specifically **not being a weeder**). Most majors are in a similar position don't worry its not just CS. 2. The reason they are ""weeders"" is because often people don't know how to take a college course (I certainly didn't when I started). You're going to need to study *a lot*, go to office hours as others have said (graduate students are your best friends, we pay them to answer your questions), **read the textbook,** do a lot of practice problems. Everyone has a different study method and you gotta try everything.. 3. Make sure to not throw September away. September as a freshman is really fun I won't lie. But if you ignore lectures and don't stay up with content, midterms in October will hurt.. 4. Find a good study group! They don't have to be your friends I promise. But it's well documented one of the largest reasons that people drop from weeders is a poor support circle. Which is totally understandable, you're new to college it's crazy and crowded yet lonely. But make sure to find people to check homework with, study, or just rant. (On a side note: This is also a large reason why minorities drop weeder classes more often.). 5. Last one: Don't give up. Some classes are designed to piss you off, *glares at calculus I and II,* until you quit. Just remember that it's hard for nearly everyone, it gets better and you're worth more than your CS project score.. . Hope this helps! Get hyped for college!",16.0,neutral,0.47781020402908325

On a national level, I think that student debt is an indicator that college degrees are not meeting the demand of the economy and/or that the kind of undergraduate degrees being produced are not in demand. You might say, ""Well, people are free to choose what kind of degree they get. Let them sort it out in the end."" That is true, but public universities have a responsibility to serve the people and the state in which they reside. I would argue that helping them get useless degrees is not beneficial to the people or the state of Michigan or the country as a whole. It puts them in debt and slows down the economy. People in debt can't take risks. Risk averse people cannot innovate and start a business, etc. So who benefits from this? Landlords. Very many students need to borrow just to pay their rent. The landlord gets paid and the student is on the hook to pay off the loan for the next 30 years. I would be interested to see how many regents of public universities are landlords or are in real estate. That is the gist of it but I will continue on a bit more about indicators of too many students.. . Another indicator, which I have not investigated, and is tangential to the ones above would be something like ""percent employment 3 months post graduation"". Another indicator would be drop out / fail out rates. These rates may indicate that the students have not been selected properly to match the rigor of the study program. It might indicate that there are not enough teaching resources per student.. . Reading this subreddit, you might think that half of the undergraduate students are ""pre-med"". Basically, we are having students self-finance their 3 / 4 - year, $60k+ MCAT prep. How many go on to become doctors? Many if not most of these students will get a BS in bio or chem or something like that which will help them get some kind of tech position to earn $35k/year or require that they get graduate degrees. There are also far too many graduate degrees. We are making so many PhDs a year and have nowhere to place them. Universities, especially research universities like U of M, churn through graduates who help their advisors publish papers.

The kinds of students who seek out Michigan (and get in) generally have long-standing aspirations for careers which start with a college degree. They are the product of a strong college-prep track. If UM said next year ""we are cutting our class in half"" what would happen to the applicants who hear no? Are they going to rethink their college aspirations? I think this is unlikely. They'll go to a different college. Similarly, if UM doubles its class size, does that mean thousands of students who weren't planning to go to college will change their minds? No. UM will pull in students who may have gone to other colleges. What UM does will not really sway college-going trends.. .

Random sexual assaults on the street are quite rare. Random non-sexual assaults that come out of the blue happen occasionally, but I'd say are still rare. Armed robberies are rare, and are taken very seriously, but they do happen, usually at retail businesses.. . Assaults by drunken idiots are common, but they are usually not random, they result from drunken idiots feeling disrespected or something, and you can usually avoid those through polite de-escalation, like apologizing for something even if you're not at fault.. . There are occasional scary, random, violent crimes in Ann Arbor. They are treated very seriously by police. Home invasions with sexual assaults might occur once a year or so. As the post above this said, sexual assault or rape by people you know occur, just as at any university, often associated with alcohol, and the incidence is likely much higher than sexual assaults by strangers.. . Murders occur about once a year, and tend to be between people who know each other, like roommates, romantic partners (or former partners), or drug-related disputes.. .

You can typically get groceries delivered for under $15 plus tip, and taxis and Ubers would be cheaper for occasional errands. Even renting a car for a weekend road trip a couple times a semester would wind up cheaper.. . If you live at Landmark, driving to central campus would be weird; you're already essentially there. Walking to the Modern Languages Building would be the farthest likely central campus class destination, and that's a ten minute walk. It might be a 4 minute drive, but the time you spend finding parking and walking from there to class is likely to be more than 6 minutes, unless you're handicapped and have special access to some university lots and reserved street parking.. .

I think the class mostly suffers from the format they use for both 115 and 116 where there is so much variance from GSI to GSI in terms of teaching. To illustrate my point, on the first exam during the winter 2020 semester, my section (about 25 people) averaged a 53% due to a GSI who was frequently rescheduling class and leaving a sub so he could travel. Contrast this to my roommate, who saw his class average on the first exam hit 74%. Generally speaking, I see the merits of the smaller class size format for Math 115 and 116, but with how much better I have been able to do in 215 and 216, I believe the wild variation in teaching methods/quality from the GSI's is the culprit as to what makes 116 by far the hardest.",2.0,negative,0.6402972340583801

There will be a couple of weeks that you study more for midterms/exams as usually the registrar does keep those close to each other for introductory classes. My advice is to not do what I did. I did have fun and met some people during my first semester freshmen year, but I was so focused on starting off strong that I went a little too hard on myself. As the other commenter said, make time to do the things you want to do. I have finally realized how to achieve that. My recommendation is to set a hard stop on your work and not budge on it. For me, last semester I told myself that I would not work past 7 (I started working around 8 in the morning for a 15 credit semester). I was able to achieve that with one exception being that I had an exam 6-8 one night. You can make that work too. Be reasonable so you do not fall behind in your course, but give yourself time every day so that you can unwind and enjoy your life. You can do both. These four years fly by fast. Before I knew it, with Covid and the passing of time, I'm now a junior and halfway through my degree. Don't live your life passively. Good luck, and welcome to Michigan!",9.0,neutral,0.6571733951568604

Just looking at it, I'd expect they will be good about performing maintenance that is legally required, or required to reduce legal liability from safety issues, and will be rather poor about maintaining things that are less important.. . My opinion is partly based on the concrete steps to the front entrance, which look recently and professionally replaced, while the yard is in poor shape, the wood railings on the balconies look old and neglected, and there is significant damage to the pavement along the driveway leading to the parking lot.. . Because it's an older building, it will probably have a slightly funky smell in the hallway and apartments, unless through lucky timing they've recently replaced carpet and repainted the interior.. . Overall, I wouldn't worry about it much. There are laws requiring certain minimum standards for rentals. The only places I've had problems with basic maintenance are in houses owned by an individual person, who just owns one or two rental properties. With an apartment building like this, being professionally managed, there is a limit to how bad it should get. Some things might be ugly or smelly, but not clearly dangerous.. . That's a decent location for students. It's a relatively quick walk to central campus, or an even quicker bike ride, or electronic scooter ride (there are scooters you can rent from an app anywhere near campus when the weather is nice).

Using your personal statement/ statement of intent to explain why your grades dipped in your freshman year and how you made up those potential gaps in your knowledge can more than make up for the low grades in a given semester. From what you write, I gather that your GPA dipped in your first semester(s) and since then you averaged it out with break-out semester(s). If you keep up an upward-ish trajectory with your semester and overall GPA's, you can pass of a bad semester or two early on as ""just a fluke."" Furthermore, when looking at the average GPA of the admitted class, pause and think why that number is the way it is. Pause to look at the composition of the class (what did the incoming class study in their undergrad institution?). It is irrefutable that not all majors are created equal and depending on the university, it is very likely that certain majors will have higher overall GPA's than others or vice versa (think a 3.6 in ChemE vs a 3.6 in PoliSci).

The class is tough for anyone, but I think that if you know your abilities and are willing to put in the work the course is completely doable. Just make sure to make time for it. Don't do 18 credits your first sem. I did it. It sucks.. . I looked at mathematical science degree requirements quickly and it looks like you can get away with not taking 116 (calc 2). So that's exciting!. . The problem is that many majors (and most of the STEM majors) require calc 2 credit to graduate. So if you end up skipping 116 and you switch to a major that does require it (and switching majors is ***incredibly common*** ***and a good thing***\*)\* you will have to take calc 2. And you do not want to take this class senior year. . At the end of the day, I think this is a good conversation to have with your advisor. They'll walk through the different possible plans. They also might be able to override you into the honors calc 1/2 classes. Skill-wise, you could probably do calc 3. It's more the major planning and prerequisites which can pose a problem. . .

Seasoned math majors sometimes do 3 or 4, but if you haven't even done Calc 3, I would not recommend it at all. . . The intro math classes (all of the ones in your F21 schedule can be considered as that) aren't meant to be done four at a time. Learning to write proofs, deal with multiple variables, and grasp the intuition behind probability at the same time is a lot to digest, and Econ 401 is not a cakewalk for many either. . . I usually err on the side of recommending more difficult schedules in general, but this? This is probably way, way too much. A more reasonable schedule would be half of the math classes each semester for four semesters (215 and 216, 217 and 425, 451 and something else, 452 and 490), and however many classes from other majors you want. It wouldn't be out of the ordinary to take two years to complete all these classes, and at a brisk pace at that. Do you really need to do all of this in just one?. . There are other problems in the schedule. Math 215 is a prereq for 425, and 451 is a prereq for 452 and 490. You can't do all of them at the same time unless you get approval, I believe. A workaround is to do math 295 in F21 and math 296 in W22. You would get introduced to analysis (451), some topology (DeBacker says you get two thirds of 490) and some group theory in the former alone. You could do diffeq alongside either of these two, and 525 after one of 295 or 296 (I forgot which) if you needed probability. You'd just be missing calc 3, which you can do as part of 395 (this covers both calc 3 and 452 I believe) the semester after 296. This covers most of the material in the 7 math classes you outlined in 5 (doable in 3 semesters with 295 and 216, 296, 525 and 395). . .

It is a lot easier to stay engaged in an in-person lecture for me just because there are less distractions and you're not just looking at a screen all day (like how it was for the past year). I would also say that it's easier to ask questions for in-person as opposed to remote because the professor can see that you have a hand raised. In some of my remote classes, the professor didn't look at chat often and so either the TAs had to help answer them or they were left completely unanswered. The quality of the answer to a question varies on the professor, but at least you get some direct acknowledgement of your question in an in-person lecture (provided the professor calls on you). . . . There are smaller aspects too that I appreciate for in-person classes, though I will highlight that you get to meet a bunch of different people throughout all your classes and the little social interactions help in maintaining your sanity. Since all of my sophomore year classes were remote, I barely met any of the people who are in my major or otherwise.

When I took it, the workload was pretty customizable but I think that the format may be professor-dependent. Our professor basically made it so that the problem sets, python projects, and iClicker were technically extra credit, and the only mandatory assignments were the exams. Therefore, if you were confident about doing well on the exams, you did not really need to do any psets or computational projects, leading to a super low workload. I am not sure if the professor for this upcoming fall has the same format though. I will say that the workload, if you did all the assignments, was actually quite high. There was a weekly pset and computational project, with the project taking a while if not familiar with Python. There was also a semester-long larger computational project that you came up with yourself and worked on, culminating in a final report. I would say, in general, both the content and workload were much more difficult/higher than 160. The exam averages were much lower, and the amount of work to keep up with the course was much higher than I remember in 160. Additionally, the Python projects in 260 are much more difficult than the 160 projects, but they are pretty interesting, and they are really the main benefit that you get from choosing 260 over 240. Overall though, the class ended up not being too difficult though because I think we had a pretty significant curve to final grades. I think you could do 451 and 260 at the same time if you were OK with 217 and 160 because I think 451 is less work than 217 (not from experience, only from what I have heard).",6.0,neutral,0.7544075846672058

This is true for literally hundreds of first year students every fall, in most cases because they have taken AP or IP exams. But ""early college"" programs also yield that result.. . Every student at Michigan is charged by the term. Not by the year. For planning purposes, students are quoted a ""cost of attendance"" figure which accounts for two full semesters. But your billing, and your financial aid, goes term by term.. . Once you attain 54 credits, you will be charged upper level tuition the NEXT term you enroll. Several students here are claiming that your tuition rate can change midterm, or that if you take a 300 level class, that will get you charged upper level tuition for that one course. That is simply not how tuition works at UM. Your tuition rate is determined by the number of credits you have at the START of the term. If it's 54 credits or less you will be charged lower division tuition for that term. If it is 55 or more, you will be charged upper level tuition. For example, if you start the term with 52 credits and take 18 credits (so you have 70 credits at the end of the term) you will still just be charged lower level tuition for that entire term. Why? Because tuition is determined by the number of credits you have at the very start of the term. . . Yes, it is entirely possible for a student to pay lower division during fall term, and upper division during winter term. Again; this is because you are charged tuition by term, and your lower/upper tuition status is determined at the start of each term.. . Often times, students will start out at Michigan determined to get credit for every single thing they can from high school. But this may not be the best strategy if some of those credits don't help them earn their degree any faster. Fortunately, the university has a process that allows students to change their mind about transfer credit (At least, I know they can change their mind about AP and IB credit). Any student can appeal to have this credit pulled back off their records. Students do this to help some drop back below the upper level credit threshold, and continue to pay lower level tuition for an additional term. It's not a trick, it's not a secret, it makes good financial sense and the Registrar has a process to make it possible. There are two caveats about this. Number one: Once you get the credit pulled off, you can't change your mind a second time ask to have it reinstated. Number two: Definitely work with an advisor first.

I just wanted to clarify a couple other things that you asked: the reason your tuition was 'hiked' is because when they sent out earlier financial aid notices, tuition hadn't been set for the 2021-2022 school year yet. The Board of Regents decide the tuition increase for the next year by early July (usually), but the financial aid office sends out award notices before then using the previous year's tuition. Now that tuition for next year has been set, they sent out a new notice with the new (higher) price of tuition. Housing is similar.. . Entering as a 'sophomore' shouldn't affect your 4 year scholarship, or other programs, but feel free to confirm this with the financial aid office for your own peace of mind.

Public transportation sucks in the US, and plane tickets are expensive (travel to east/west coast can be anywhere from $200-500 round trip). . .

It's much better than grinning and bearing it without doing much about the situation. . . . You're being too hard on yourself. Some of your expectations for where you should be at now or in the near future are not realistic. There are plenty of people who have come in to school here without any work experience. If you're in your second year of school, you are fine on the internship track. Most people who get an internship after their first year of school got it by having a connection or having a near insurmountable ambition, plus just a bit of luck. Don't let where other people are at frustrate you. I recommend you try and find one organization that allows you to try something new (or anything that gives you even a remote amount of interest) and give it a full shot and just try and show up. That action can serve as double-dipping as a resume builder and a chance to socialize with people. . . . It is easy to be overwhelmed by these thoughts. Identify what you would like to change and set as many goals as you think you can achieve in a day. Large results come from small, daily actions. For example, if you can't make it through the 30-40 pages (which most people don't read all of the pages), make it your goal to skim the pages so you get enough of the main idea to carry yourself. Write it down if you cannot remember it. . . . Your feelings about your situation are valid. Our world nowadays feels the need to assign worth to people based on comparison. However, you have to fight some of these thoughts and find a way to change your perspective (and it can be a slow process). You feel like a failure, but I disagree with that. You're still fighting, even if you are struggling, and you haven't given up yet. You're only a failure when you give up entirely. I can sense a strong desire to succeed from your post, so try and focus your thoughts more towards actions you can take to achieve this goal rather than muddling yourself with thoughts of failure. It is okay to be struck down by a setback, as long as you stand up with the determination to continue. I can only offer so much help with your mindset though, as I am no professional, so I highly ask that you seek out professional help with your thoughts. . . . You're not an idiot. Feel free to reach out to me if you want and I can offer some help in the area of interests/purpose as I have battled those thoughts before in the past as well. Good luck, and our community and the Umich staff are always here to help in making you succeed!",2.0,error,0.0

Another thing to consider is that there are very sharp students at U-M, folks who test at a 98% percentile in a range of standardized tests, and the folks at the 90% percentile can seem considerably less smart by comparison.

The modern college experience forces students like yourself to treat college like a job where you feel like you need to come in with a bunch of experience just to be able to *learn* about something. The purpose of the x50 classes is to train inexperienced people the basics of how parts / mechatronic systems / projects are constructed. At UM, you are often surrounded by people who are over-achievers and this can, at times, completely skew the point of school: to *learn*. . . Some ME250-specific advice: understand that you're a beginner and that you know nothing about what goes on in a machine shop (forget what you even think you know). Even for the kids who have prior experience, the head shop staff (very experienced machinists) don't care if you spent 4 years working in a machine shop during high school EC's - they are going to show you everything and help you along the way. The very best you can do for yourself is to pay attention and ask questions. Some guys might give you a hard time but that's an expected woe of being a beginner in that environment. Keep your chin up and you'll be fine.. . Some other ME advice: pay attention to the real-world applications that your coursework mentions. The fundamental courses (200-level) don't really mention applications - 300 level and above is when the real stuff starts. When you start learning about them, look into the ones that interest you because they are what engineers actually work on. For me, it was batteries and energy storage (got inspired in ME382). For you, it could be controls (software oriented, could be a nice mesh of your interests), or it could be thermo / heat transfer (lots of modeling). But either way, paying attention to how the concepts you learn about are employed in real world systems will 1) make you a better engineer, and 2) make it easier to remember everything because its entrenched in the world you live in.. .

You might also consider looking into SI professors or even professors from other departments, if there's another field you're interested in, and ask if they could use a coder.. * You probably just want to cold email professors, but don't get discouraged if some ghost you.

How good or rough the experience gets can vary a bunch by building and manager/HD, but I'll drop a text-wall so at least you're hopefully not caught off-guard by stuff.. . My **Grievances/Cautions** are mainly:. . * policy-setting upper-management staff definitely don't care about your time. * ceaseless trainings that waste your time and could've been an email and are administered to staff as though they're in pre-school. * unless you get a chill HD, be ready to get weird amounts of flack over really unimportant bullshit like the quality of your monthly hallway posterboards. * out of stuff to cover but the meeting is scheduled for another hour? you best believe you're not getting out of it.. * have no work-life balance. * got an exam at 4am and trying to sleep? Too bad, 'cus people are pounding on your door even though you're not on-call and expect you to help with drama, drunks, noise issues, etc.. * Housing puts it right in your contract that it asserts itself as your first priority, the only exception being classes that are mandatory AND not rescheduleable. * Be ready to potentially sacrifice your holidays. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, which fell on Black Friday, because I was assigned to work an event that literally nobody came to.. * other. * generally end up in a small ~~cell~~ room unless you get a no-singles building like Markley, where RA's get a double to themselves. * inevitable frustration when people are shitheads and Housing's anti-accountability beliefs kick in (pursuit of ""restorative justice"" rather than punitive measures, ie: doing nothing of consequence). * shoutout to the serial shitter that never got investigated. * inevitable encounters with heavy events that can mess with some people more than others. People might come to you with issues about stalking, sexual assault, suicidal ideation/intent.. * I've dealt with all of those issues and even though much of the work is emotional support and referring people to DPSS, resources, etc. within the university, there **is** an emotional weight you carry after some of that stuff. * You have to be able to be confrontational and initiate what'll absolutely be uncomfortable conversations. Roommate disputes, deviant behaviors, etc.. . **Re: The Theme of Building-Staff Variance**. . * how you schedule desk shifts will vary and you might get fucked with a really jank schedule. Even if it is only for a few hours a week, they might just shit a two hour shift into your small gap in a Wednesday when you have 5 other classes lined up.. * how you schedule on-call shifts will vary and you similarly might get fucked with on-call shifts the night before a midterm, the night before your 8am, etc.. * you can swap these with staff but if nobody wants to swap you can get shafted. * Some buildings are also just gonna be more of a shitshow, others more chill. Got Markley? God help you, there's a reason why there's 4 people on duty at night. Got NQ/NW/Stockwell? Kick back and relax.. * Sometimes you just get a really easy or really nightmare hall. * I generally tried to tread my residents like adults and summarized everything to the mantra ""don't be a dick, don't puke in my hall, and knock or GroupMe if you need me"" -- and 2 of 3 halls generally respected that. * On the flip side, some halls are basically ""cursed"" or you just get bad luck that year. My freshmen year hall was wild and our RA pretty much snapped. .

I personally never did any research because I was not interested, but many of my in-major friends and classmates did. Here is my advice:. . - Take upper levels. After taking 281, you will be able to take EECS upper levels (I am assuming you are a CS major). Most of these professors conduct their own research, and at the end of the semester nearly always give an open offer to the class for students to reach out if they want to do research. Capitalize on that. . - Go to office hours. If the above is not your style, or you would like to develop a relationship with the professor beforehand, attend office hours. You can even ask questions not related to class work. They often prefer this. Then at the end of the semester ask in person or email in regards to a research opportunity. You don't even have to go that often, you would be surprised how well they can remember you. Just show interest and be authentic. . - Ask your CS advisor where you can find research. Set up an appointment and go from there. Most CS professors anyway are available to be an advisor, so if you really wanted to speak to a specific professor you could do that. . - Be on the EECS undergrad email list. For obvious reasons, this gives you generic notifications about research. But more importantly, Mark Brehob sends out an annual email at the end of April with summer CS research projects. Professor Brehob famously teaches EECS 470 Computer Architecture, but I personally took EECS 370 with him. This email links a mega-spreadsheet with open positions, who to email, if the opportunity is paid or for credit or neither, the head professor / mentor, the number of other students involved, and a short project description. . .

I was a windows PC person at home growing up but also used a MacBook in high school. For all of college, I used a MacBook and I have no regrets. . . In regards to the U of M CS major, most professors use Macs. Classes are taught in a way that is friendly to both Mac and Linux users, so you will not have any learning handicaps. However, I will say that most IAs (instructor aids aka teaching assistants aka who will help you when your code doesn't work aka gods walking among us) have Macs. This is important because in office hours, usually Mac using IAs help Mac using students while Linux users get help from Linux IAs. This is especially pertinent if you have an OS specific setup question. So you can view that as a con, or as a pro in the sense that you might get help faster. Note that in the gateway classes, your OS won't really matter. Either type of IA will help you regardless as well. . . In the upper levels specifically the distributed systems track, you will notice more professors, students, and IAs that use Linux. My partner and I both had Macs and were totally fine. As I mentioned, your learning is not inhibited in anyway. The school server called CAEN is Linux (you might use this in more upper levels) so you'll be familiarized with it anyway. So having a Mac might be advantageous anyway because you'll learn how to use both ecosystems. The computer labs have both Macs and Linux computers, so you'll be fine in that regard. There are more Linux computers on North campus and in the engineering buildings though than central. . . An important point to consider is that a lot of EECS classes (past the beginning gateway weed out classes) are partner based. Most students have Macs. If you end up getting a Windows computer, you might have a more annoying time sharing code. Not harder, but more annoying. That is just something to consider. Or, if you fit the PC personality, you might like having a Windows over a Mac because you'll find a like-minded partner. Either way, if you use version control correctly (most people won't) having a team of multiple operating systems won't matter. . . One last point in regards to OS that I would like to add is about the industry standard. Obviously, Linux has been around for a long time and a lot of legacy code was created on that OS. Definitely industry standard. However, my personal experience with internships as well as the experiences of all my CS friends has had a heavy use of Mac OS, in big and small companies alike. In the long run, it does not matter, but just something to consider if you care or want to go into iOS app dev. . . I'm obviously biased towards Mac because I had one for all of college. Some other perks that I was grateful for:. - Macs, especially the MacBook Air, are extremely light. In college, this is really nice. Not that CS majors are carrying books anyway... . - Side tangent, I will state that the ""culture"" of CS note taking at Michigan is to have an iPad and take notes on the slides. When you have a Mac and use the Apple ecosystem, sharing files is a lot easier (I love you Airdrop). The same applies to sharing files with your partner. . - Scripting and the command line are in Linux mostly. Macs can easily download a bash shell. . . Ok, that's enough about OS. In terms of specs, a 3k budget is very nice. Macs are always a rip off anyway so focus on the RAM over storage. You'll wipe your drive after most semesters anyway. Some projects you to require several GBs of data though (I'm looking at you 388), so I wouldn't go fully barebones there.. . In terms of screen size, most people I know went 13"". Keep in mind that in college you usually have your laptop out in class, so portability is important to keep in mind. I had friends who had 15"" but they always complained. The computer labs (where office hours are often held) also have plenty of monitors you can connect to. Also if you go Mac and decide to get an iPad, you can use the iPad as an additional monitor. . .

Then your screen size matters, I'd recommend 15"" for coding, but 13-14"" can be really nice for portability, it's up to you.. . N.B. The laptop will need Thunderbolt, which is why I didn't mention AMD, as I'm not aware of any popular AMD laptops with Thunderbolt?. . Dell's XPS are really nice (if slightly heavy), Razer makes good stuff with their blade, Samsung's galaxy book pro is really portable, and my current laptop; LG's Gram, HP's Spectre, all good Thunderbolt laptops. I'd expect to pay ~$1300-$1700 for a laptop like these if you get a 1TB SSD and 16GB memory.. . Then lastly you'll need a graphics card. Now might be the wrong time to buy one, what with the chip shortage, and I'm not really hip to the current good cards. You might find a good deal, but also might pay $800-$1000 on one. I'd check userbenchmark.com and maybe some youtubers and see what the best value stuff is for games you might want to play. Also if you don't plan on gaming anytime soon, maybe delay the purchase, the market might be improving, but it might also be 6 months -\\_(tsu)_/-.. . So yeah, maybe look into an eGPU and a monitor if you have $3000 free, it'll be a better gaming experience at your desk. And like honestly, you don't need a high powered laptop for coding, I'd recommend something more portable that can dock and become a better experience.. . ...wow that's a lot of writing, hope it helps!",1.0,error,0.0

I think after everything that happened with Covid, a lot of staff members dropped. So they are probably desperate for more RAs. Additionally, Res Staff members would always drop throughout the year meaning people on the wait list would get spots. . . If you apply now you'll most likely be hired at some point during the year.. . I personally had a love hate relationship with being an RA. . . Professionally: My HDs were great and treated the Res Staff with enough respect and they understood that we were students. The pro staff above our HDs (ADAC, etc.) Were awful and made the job miserable. They were apathetic to our needs and wouldn't take any feedback. (There were tons of other problems too).. . Socially: I lost touch with a lot of my friends. My first year being an RA was my sophomore year. A lot of my friends moved into a house together while I moved back into the dorms as an RA. This meant meant all got super close and I had a 25 minute walk if I ever wanted to spend time with them. I also didn't ever become super close with any of the other RAs-- we are all mostly good acquaintances, but I haven't hung out with them outside of work ever. Junior year (this past year) was weird because of covid so I won't comment on that. Now for my senior year, I looked for a place off campus to live so that I can make new friends and have my free time back.. . My favorite part of the job was talking with the residents. If you dont let the ""power"" go to your head you'll be able to create tons of close bonds with a bunch of fun people. I know a few of my residents told me I inspired them to apply to be RAs (oh god what have I done to them...). But I think the most rewarding part of the job is watching your 50+ students mature and being able to provide help when they need it. The obnoxious drunks and random wake ups all become worth it in the long run. I have tons of fun story's about my time on duty as well as many fond memories of receiving thank you notes from drunk/high/crossed residents, or helping residents sneak the lounge table out of their room after using it to play pong and then getting too drunk to move it back out on their own (you know who you are @threeves). I even miss talking to my residents when we coincidentally walked into the bathroom at 4am to brush our teeth.. . A lot of people hated working as an RA and their views are completely valid. If you dont absolutely love talking and connecting with tons of people and aren't willing to put up with the crap from upper housing directors, then you will hate the job. But if you're able to tune out all the garbage and just have fun with the job and your residents, I think you will have a great time.. .

You'll have to scroll for a bit though because it's not a popular brand.. . If that doesn't work, you can try to email the Munger staff with a picture of the table. However, you have to be really careful about lighting since the marble tends to produce strange iridescence patterns, especially if there is too much sunlight entering from the windows. Some units in Munger were actually furnished by different companies, so it's very important that the picture you send to the Munger staff accurately captures the color and specular properties of the marble. I find the best lighting conditions arise under a half moon just after sunset or a total lunar eclipse. You might be wondering why you can't just ask them to come see the table in person. All visitation by staff needs to be recorded under a valid ""visitation reason code."" Unfortunately, identifying a coffee table is not a valid code (according to their current employee handbook). . If that doesn't work, you can try to contact the Munger groundskeeper and ask him yourself. Apparently he was personally responsible for overseeing the installation of furniture in every single unit, and even oversees replacements when needed. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any official contact information for him on any UM website or Munger emails. Internal HR logs don't turn up anything, and weirdly enough there isn't even a ""Munger groundskeeper"" position in the UM jobs database. The only way to contact him is to catch him when is making rounds through the building. Fortunately, he seems to have a pretty set pattern so it shouldn't be too hard. On the night of the first full moon of the month between the hours of 12:30am and 1:15am, go to the piano practice rooms in the basement and bring a red onyx and a string (the community center can lend these to you). Enter the back left room and leave the red onyx tied to or looped around the doorknob. Start playing ""Mary had a little lamb"" (just the melody is fine) on repeat, slowing down slightly with each repetition. The Munger groundskeeper is quite fond of children's songs, and if he hears you, he will make his way to the piano rooms by way of the lobby stairwell. You should hear him coming down the steps, so feel free to leave the practice room and meet him at the bottom. Unfortunately, I have not met the groundskeeper in person, so I don't know what he looks like in person. Although he is fond of music, he is not fond of college students at all. You will have only one opportunity to ask your question, so be *very specific* about which piece of furniture you want to know about. . . **Very important note:** If at any point during your piano playing the lights in the room start flickering, immediately stop playing and CLOSE THE PIANO. Wait in the room until the lights stop flickering. The red onyx should keep you safe, but feel free to pray to your deity of choice for protection. When the lights stop flickering, leave the basement immediately. You will have to wait until the next full moon to meet the groundskeeper.. . Source: lived in Munger last fall.",15.0,error,0.0

But I didn't really have friends in high school and college was where I learned how to make friends and it really was a matter of learning what ways worked best for me. . . First, the answer is yes. It is possible. If you believe. It's a hokey response, but it's all about mindset. It sounds like you're worried about making friends, which is understandable. It's important. But try to watch out for it. That might turn into desperation and it repels people. Same with the jealousy. It's hard, though. Social media doesn't make it easy. . . So the first step is really mindset. Believe you'll make friends. And sure, they might turn into lifelong friends, but that doesn't matter because first they just need to be college friends. The stakes aren't that high. Anyway, mindset aside, how do you do it? How do you make friends? A few ways that worked for me. . . Classes. Never underestimate the potential of people sitting next to you or in the same room. They can be good connections. . . Housing. If you're in a dorm, that's helpful. But if you're in an apartment, your neighbors can be pretty cool. Just have to talk to them. . . Clubs and student orgs! I used all the other methods, but clubs were what I used the most. It was just a matter of going to enough clubs and exploring to find clubs and people that clicked. How do you find clubs? Maize Pages! It's the best thing ever! Also the club fairs like Festifall where they table and you just walk around going to all the welcome tables and welcome meetings. . . And as for lifelong friends, a lot of my college friends faded away. Because that's how life works. But I have a small number that are really close. I never would've predicted it would be these ones, but I'm glad they're still in my life. And the others?

We talked a lot about the battles and wars in those epics, but we also focused on culture, like gender relations at the time, religious practices, architectural styles, philosophy, science, etc. I think that's the part I liked the most, how the class was narrow enough to stay focused but broad enough where everyone's main interests in the period were likely to be covered. There was a lot of material, and tbh this is the class whose exam I studied the longest for in my 2 years here (and there were about 80 pages of reading per week).

There are a few freshman level classes taking place there (ENGR 100 robotics section, ROB 101 to name a few) that might interest you if you end up at UMich!. . . 3. For startups, I would highly recommend applying to StartUM. It's a club that pairs students who have startup ideas with a team of peers to help them and they provide help with the business and networking aspects of creating a business. I joined for one semester (unfortunately the sem that COVID hit, so I didn't get too much out of it), but I know of many students who came out of it with fairly successful startups. I also suggest checking out the ENTR classes -- I haven't taken any, but they seem pretty fun and interesting!. . . 4. I would say the culture is very dependent on who you surround yourself with. I can't speak for CS, but as an ME student I've easily been able to find a group of friends to study with and have found my school experience far more collaborative than competitive.. . . 5. It seems like you're pretty focused on gaining something career-wise out of your clubs, so for that I would highly recommend joining a project team, as well as getting involved with professional organizations (I'm in SWE and ASME, not sure what the CS equivalents are). Those can hook you up with good connections and be a lot of fun! This being said, I would advise against only joining clubs because you think they'll help your career. You'll be pretty miserable if you spend all your free time doing clubs that don't interest you, and a lack of passion would likely be obvious and unimpressive to an interviewer/job recruiter. I would say it's best to join clubs that you are truly excited about, even if they're unrelated to your career goals.. . . 6.

Even if you don't take a formal avenue to pursuing research, it's not unheard of to find a position simply by cold-emailing profs who do research you're interested in! .

They're closed ""mixers"" as we called it then, with usually just the host fraternity and one sorority.
