I am not entirely familiar with our relationship with the University, much less the relationship of other teams with the University, but you can't argue we aren't successful (although we do acknowledge that doesn't make us ""better"" than anyone else). Additionally, we have gone through numerous reductions in space and resources even during my time in order to provide more resources to other Wilson teams.. . * Our cars have been completely safe historically, and we have never in our history caused any serious injuries whatsoever. I'm not entirely sure where you get the idea we are in any way less safe than other project teams.. . * We are currently in the process of designing an entirely new car from scratch - just because our 2019 car was similar to our 2017 car in general shape does not mean there aren't major improvements under the hood, and there are many years where our car is completely redesigned, quite potentially including this one. If we do something similar to our past endeavors, it's because we ran it against new ideas and the old ones won - change for the sake of change isn't a winning strategy. . * We actually have a massive presence in the machine shop, it's just mostly over the summer. The majority of our parts are manufactured in-house, including all of the carbon fiber parts and the large majority of the mechanical parts as well. . * Similarly, we have significantly compacted the space we take up over the course of the school year to help provide that space to other teams. You may not be aware of this, but that entire wing used to be ours! Nowadays, we keep things to what we need to store and work on critical projects during the school year. . * I have no idea what this is referring to so cannot comment. . * I'm sure every team has members that see it as merely a resume building tool - however, those members generally don't stay for long. . * We literally are there every day when we need to be, and when we don't (most of the school year) we try to let other teams have priority on access to the space and equipment. This is simply a consequence of the timing of our competition, and I'm not really sure what the complaint is here - that we purposefully give other teams as much room as we can most of the time? We do at some point need to work as much as anybody else, so I'm not sure that ""uses the workshop"" is a valid complaint. . * Our parts are designed to be as light as possible while meeting our safety requirements. This has paid off in the past, allowing us to operate reliably in situations in which other teams would be operating unsafely (in 2019, for example, a few teams with ultralight cars got blown off the road, while we got hit by a dust devil and kept going like nothing happened). So yes, not being the lightest solar car on the race track did literally directly help us come in third place in 2019. . * Sending an alumnus to Australia with our cells was not a consequence of our poor planning, it was a consequence of our cell manufacturer becoming delayed by several weeks. Out of our hands. . * Our 2019 car was our latest to have the array built in team history due to the aforementioned delays by our manufacturer, and we still had enough time to test every system on the car. We needed only to stop a grand total of one time over the course of a five day race, and it was for under a minute while a driver plugged back in a cable he had accidentally unplugged. We had been testing the car since, like, May, so I'm also not sure where you get the idea anything was last-minute. . * I can't promise no member will ever annoy you, and I'm sorry that seems to have been the case in the past. . * I have been on the team for three years and have no recollection of any ""special events"" we were invited to, but I am interested in hearing what you're thinking of here. . * We took third place in WSC 2019, second place in ASC 2018, second place in WSC 2017 (the best WSC placement in the team's history), first place in ASC 2016, fourth place in WSC 2015 (with the closest *time* to first place in our team's history), first place in the 2015 Abu Dhabi Solar Challenge, and first place in ASC 2014, with the last race we didn't do well in being WSC 2013. I'm not sure what exactly qualifies to you as ""recent success,"" but I think it's clear we've had it. While it is true that our two-year budget is higher than many other ASC teams, we race each year on a car that was built for a competition the year prior and often need to make large modifications to comply with ASC regulations (exactly zero of which make the car faster), so for example you have the best placing car in our team's WSC history (Novum) losing ASC the very next year. Budget does not directly correlate with success - our budget is the result of countless hours of hard work from our Business division, and our success is the result of countless hours of hard work from our engineers. We are far from the most well-funded team competing in WSC, and still manage to consistently do well despite competing against teams made entirely of graduate students who work on their cars full-time for the school year leading up to the race. I do appreciate the idea that we're so good that us not winning would be news, though - we've worked really damn hard to get all of that, so the sentiment is appreciated! . * In general, you get out of Solar Car what you put in. If you don't feel you have enough to do, ask for more and you'll get it every time. I'm managing around 20 recruits in my division right now, and I have a list of around 50 critical tasks to put them on, which could easily grow longer if we somehow get through everything important enough to make the first draft. If one or more past leaders did a poor job managing workload, then that is a shame, but if you actively seek out work you *will* find it. . . So, while I can't necessarily speak to every point, and while it does sound like you have had some poor experiences with the team in the past, for which I do apologize, I will note that a lot of what you have said here is a lot more negative than the reality of the situation. At the end of the day, we're just a group of college kids all dedicated to making the best solar car we can, so we're not always going to be perfect - but, honestly, I think we'd be incredibly boring if we were. We're not always going to make the right call the first time, but that's what allows any member to make a difference, and ultimately what lets us focus on our core mission - training the world's best solar car engineers/businesspeople.",8.0,error,0.0

It's actually beneficial to get cells as late as possible - unlike an engine, they are impossible to ""tune"" or improve in any fashion, and they constantly degrade in efficiency while exposed to light, so using them as little as possible is a definite benefit (not to mention the risk of damage, both from things hitting the exceptionally fragile cells and damage caused by dirt particles in the air while driving at speed). This is why most of our cars that build their arrays early make two uppers - the second one has no cells, and can be used for the bulk of our testing. . . . . This is not to say we had planned on getting the cells so late - our original agreement with our array manufacturer was that he would get us the cells in the late summer, but he suffered several delays and ultimately was only able to get them to us in the early fall. . . . . However, we still completed the array in time for our scheduled second mock race, which was at least a week long of round-the-clock testing under conditions that matched the race as close as we possibly could, which gave us plenty of testing time to be confident it would work when the actual race began around a month later. . . . .

Even if we disregard the history of unsafe vehicles in the competition (a death in 2004, solar cars burning to the ground during competition) you follow NO safe practices while designing your vehicle. . . No material testing is done on your ENTIRELY composite chassis, which if you know ANYTHING about composites is completely idiotic. Because there is so much variability in the strength of the composite based on how well you manufacture it, this testing is essential to validate the strength of your chassis. Without it you are literally guessing at how strong your car is with a shitty FEA model, and based on my few peeks into your car, your composite layups look pretty terrible, and there's no way you can just use the manufacturer's data. Not only that, but your rules only specify to design for a 5g impact load!! I cannot stress how extremely idiotic this is, seeing as these cars go 70mph on open highways! A 5g impact is equal to at most a 10mph crash, and even then I would anticipate ~10g so that's pushing it. This design load should be AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE higher at the LEAST. FSAE requires their teams to design for a 40g impact, and their average speeds are significantly lower, AND THEY DON'T DRIVE ON ROADS WITH ACTUAL 1000+KG CARS COMING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. On top of ALLLL of this, maybe the most egregious rule is that you don't need a steel roll hoop for the American competition. For those who don't know, a roll hoop exists to keep the driver safe in a rollover accident. With your shoddily made composite roll hoop, designed for 5g impact, I have no doubt your driver would die in a serious rollover accident.. . Not only that, your braking system doesn't even have to work by rules. The only real rule there, is that you have to be able to brake at 0.5g. This is not even close to an industry standard, and the braking rule SHOULD be to lock all 4 tires. This ensures that your braking system can provide the maximum deceleration available with the tire grip available. I have no idea how this is allowed, or what smooth brain wrote these rules.. . Lastly, your egress rules are ridiculous. A 15 second egress is far to long to get the driver out in case of a battery fire. Not only this, but after talking to some solar car guys, they openly admitted that should the driver be knocked unconscious, there's no way you could get them out due to the design of your cockpit.. . On all of this, the car is VERY unstable with crosswinds. Solar car team members have admitted that large trucks passing the solar car create enough wind to push the solar car INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. This is silly engineering.. . The fact that you get 1 million+ dollars every year to build a shiny teardrop shaped deathtrap is amusing and saddening. Talking to the engineers on your team shaves years off of my life, and one day your car will shave all the years left off of some poor undergraduate.. . TLDR: . Their impact structures are built to withstand about ~10% of the load they might see in a crash, their brakes don't work half as well as they should, their driver will die in a rollover or battery fire, the cockpit is a deathtrap that is extremely difficult to escape from, and the car veers into oncoming traffic due to crosswinds.",14.0,error,0.0

We understand that barely meeting regulations would not be the safest thing for our drivers, and so we design to higher load cases, resulting in a heavier car but one that is much much safer. I'm not on our composites team, but we have a literal entire team of people dedicated to working on our carbon fiber roll cage is as strong or stronger than an equivalent metal one would be, and several other solar car teams with significantly less safe carbon roll cages have *actually* rolled in the past without causing any injuries to their drivers, while we have both avoided rolling and offered far more protection if we do. Safety is absolutely the top priority for our team. . . . . As for the brakes: . . * **WSC 2.21.8** - The service braking system must be able to stop the fully laden solar car within distance 0.1v+0.0060v^2 metres from any speed v, in km/h, that the solar car can achieve.. . * **WSC 2.21.9** - If the service braking system fails, the secondary braking system must be able stop the fully laden solar car within distance 0.1v+0.0158v^2 metres from any speed v, in km/h, that the solar car can achieve. . . To achieve this, we do of course have all of our wheels locked - however, there's only so much you can achieve on tires designed to have the lowest coefficient of rolling resistance possible, so trying to directly compare us to teams for whom crr is a nonfactor is of course going to work out to different accelerations.. . . . A 15 second egress is the absolute maximum. I personally can get out of our 2019 car in half that, and our drivers can do it even faster. Furthermore, our steering wheel is removable, so it should not be an issue to remove an unconscious driver in an emergency even if it were a bit harder by taking out the steering wheel first and then pulling the driver out. Admittedly, we haven't outright tested it, but I'll add that to tests we can run on our upcoming car! . . . . As for crosswinds, our car is exceptionally stable in crosswinds. I literally watched a dust devil form just to the right of the road and literally hit our car straight from the side and cause almost no perceivable difference in the car's heading. Other, lighter cars from other teams have certainly had stability issues in crosswinds - we have not. . . . . So while I will not argue that the regulations are perfect, our team sets our bar higher than the bare minimum of the regs (for a visual indicator of this, consider the fact that we have a carbon fiber rollcage at all - WSC regulations only require a shroud, not the front bars) and we have a stellar track record on driver safety, which continues to always be *the* top priority in any car we design.

The point was that it is an unsafe competition, which remains true. It takes place in the Australian outback, one of the most inhospitable places on Earth, and two major competitors saw their cars fly off the road (and I think catch fire?) at the last competition. While this doesn't mean UM Solar Car will necessarily have a problem, one car crash always has the potential to spiral into more. . - The issue with the argument that change for no reason isn't worthwhile is that it can still be change for education. New team members will feel like they have input on the design, and they will learn some of the finer points of the design and feel more invested if there are more changes. . - I would say the argument that you take up less space than you used to is helpful, but you still take up a third of the floor, the largest space on the Mezzanine, and used to have an office until the Wilson Center decided that certain teams having both work space and office was unfair to the rest of us. . - Additionally, although you don't have it any more, you used to have a massive eyesore of a semi-trailer parked right outside the Wilson Center (granted I think you shared it with someone). The entire purpose was additional storage and advertising of Solar Car's name extremely prominently; it was used as a trailer so seldom that it rusted out and became condemned. It took up parking dropoff space while it was there, when that entire area is specifically a no-parking dropoff-only zone. . - The argument that your competition time means you don't need to use the space the rest of the year is weak. All of the rest of us have summer competitions as well, but we still go in to work on machining and electrical wiring throughout the year, not to mention any other projects we need. We do this because it allows us to run through multiple iterations of vehicles and have proper testing, which is always very useful. There is an argument that the snow would mess with your testing in the winter, but it does the same thing to everyone else, and we go in just the same for unit testing. . - May testing is last minute for a summer project, and this comes from somebody whose team is painfully aware that starting to test in the last few months is a bad idea. I think your team competes in October, though, so it isn't that bad. . - I don't know what special events the responder is thinking of either, but I do know that the campus tours are noticeable. Two years ago, I had reason to come in to the Wilson Center every Friday afternoon. Every time, without fail, a campus tour would come through, and they would walk straight through the Wilson Center, ignoring every team around them, and just point out Solar Car and how amazing it was. That in itself is an incredibly valuable recruiting tool, and one that Solar Car gets that none of the rest of us do. . - Most of the teams in the Wilson Center have Business teams that work with major Fortune 500 sponsors, and they all need people. . - I actually believe that your Business team always needs more members, but what I have heard is that new recruits on the engineering side tend to be given busy work, which is none of interesting, educational, or useful. I believe that is what the responder was referring to. . - I would suggest to the responder saying that we are out of touch that people who work next to Solar Car every day now might have a better idea of the current situation than an alumnus, but I admit that I do not have personal knowledge of the engineering problems. I do know that every other team has just as many engineering problems as Solar Car, if not more. . - I agree that most of us in the Wilson Center get irritated by Solar Car's big budget, and I can believe your competition has some problems. The issue is more that the remarkable amount of sponsorship that Solar Car gets means that the other teams, especially newer teams, have less sponsorship available to them if the sponsor has a budget for how much sponsorship they can hand out. . - Additionally, I would argue that being part of a Business team with less money and fewer sponsors raises more interesting budgetary problems and opportunities to reach out to new sponsors. I actually think that having a massive existing portfolio is a mixed bag, and is most useful to the people mostly interested in boosting their resumes or getting ""easy"" internships. . - I admit I don't know how you run Business team, but I have to reference the point about applications. I was talking with a former officer around a year ago, and, when the question came up, he attempted to say, with a straight face, ""We don't have an application process. We just have a process where you may or may no be officially asked to join..."", which is where his nerve failed him and he couldn't keep a straight face. At which point the other person in the conversation said, ""My roommate got rejected from Solar Car last year."" I can't speak for all teams, but there are many teams in the Wilson Center without application processes, but Solar Car (Engineering -- I don't know about Business) is not one of them. . - Since the poster included a link, this is a link to the Wilson Center's list of all of the amazing teams in the Wilson Center (including Solar Car). It has links to all of their websites and contact info, and most teams are always interested in hearing from you if you send them an email asking about joining.

His basic thesis is that ""passion vs. profitability"" is very much a false dichotomy, and _blindly_ pursuing one or the other is going to make you miserable and/or destitute. He did some research into that makes people actually feel happy in their work, and the three key factors determining whether somebody is happy in their career were:. . - Autonomy, that is, feeling like you have control over your life,. - Competence, that is, feeling like you're legitimately good at what you do, and,. - Relatedness, that is, the ability to meet and connect with other people through your work.. . ""Profitable"" degrees like engineering are great for autonomy, since your job skills are in high enough demand that you legitimately can (and should) just walk away from a toxic work environment and trust that you'll be able to find a less awful position elsewhere.. . But it would (IMO) be a bad idea to study something like engineering if you genuinely _hate_ the subject, since you'd probably be unlikely to get truly _good_ at something that you actually despise.. . I've also actually been pleasantly surprised, as a CS major, at how easy it's been to find pleasant and emotionally well-adjusted people off of whom to Socially Mooch, even outside of classroom settings. But I've also perceived a kind of ""boy's club"" atmosphere - and not necessarily a deliberate or malicious one - born out of the fact that most UMich CS majors (in my experience, and including myself) are white/East Asian/South Asian men who've literally been programming since early high/middle/elementary school and are already well-versed in the ""culture"", which I think exacerbates impostor syndrome among students lacking that background, and which may make them feel like they don't belong. I don't have data to support this, but I personally suspect that that plays a major role in the department's gender imbalance, even relative to other engineering majors.. . That said, I have met a lot of women who are successful and seem happy as CS majors, and (from what I've seen) they often find friends and support systems through organizations like the Society of Women Engineers. And I _think_ that the ""boys club"" thing is becoming less of an issue; IIRC, famous open-source guru Richard Stallman finally got booted from his position at MIT for (among other things) his constant sexual harassment of women in his office.",2.0,error,0.0

KEY POINT : 2/3 of the new cases in Washtenaw County over the last two weeks are in Ann Arbor Zip Codes.. . Further, note these aren't including Student cases as the dashboard was supposed to report them. Although UoM has (finally) added student cases from testing sites off campus [note: they aren't including staff or faculty cases from off campus sites, which is where I personally kniw many staff have had to use because of the wait times at UoM health system]. So as of Friday, there are 269 cases at the university over the last 14 days and 209 in Ann Arbor zip codes. UoM can't include positivity rates from off outside UoMtests, but lsdt week inside the UoM Health system was 14.3%. This was despite the fact over 1.2 of tests were repeated testies last week (from the weekly testing of athletes. I 'm unclear if they only started widespread athletic testing before September 10th, but if they did, its actually 2.4k repeated testies in the last two weeks.). . Just to ram this home, 20% of reported Ann Arbor community covid cases since the start of the March are from the last two weeks alone.. 55% of reportes UoM cases since the start of the March are from the last two weeks alone.. . And neither are reporting on cases among Michigan Medicine employees. . . I'm not saying we are doing poorly, but I am saying the numbers are way worse than UoM is portraying them (frankly they need to be including local Ann Arbor cases because those are clearly linked to the UoM cases). . Edit: just to note, I forgot to mention that those 68 dorm cases would be out of the total 260 cases by 9/19 is 25% of all cases. Remember as well since only about 840 of those 6100 resident students are enrolled in random testing, most reported cases from forms are going to be symptom bases as that's how the current op-in system works. So back of the envolope math says that at the minimum reported potential asymptomatic carriers for ages 20-25 (40%, though other studies say up to 80), there were likely actually 105 cases by 9/19 in the dorms alone. But this is an estimate so not gospel. . . Further, since they don't break down testing numbers by on/off campus, its really unclear what the positivity rate is in different groups. Case in point is we know around 1.2k of tests per week are being used to test athletes. Removing the non student tests and the random testing program (as it is less than 20% including on campus test), only 4486 test were administered to students from move in to 9/19. Conservatively assuming that 15% of the undergrad students are not in Ann Arbor (and ignoring graduate students which I'm sure aee being reported as students on the dashboard), 18% of students ae living on campus, 82% off. So if testing is equally spread across that, only 808 dorm students were tested. More likely, its probably 30-40% of tests, so its actually around 1600 from the dorms who have been tested during thst period. So positivity for dorms is 4.2%. Not bad, but only 1/4 form students were tested. That's abysmal. . . Taking our (conservative) prediction that there were actually 105 cases from that time, its actually 6.5% positivity rate. WHO recommends governments shouldn't be reopening until positivity rares are below 5% for 2 weeks. So as of 9/19 we were knowingly just under that, and assuming asymptomatic cases, actually over it.",2.0,error,0.0

t1_g6yzw30,2020-09-28 17:22:12,t1_g6y8972,t3_j146ad,"It's complicated but i suspect it's due to 3 primary reasons. The 1st being personality and life experiences. A lot of top tier school culture parallels capitalism very closely in the way few care about your feelings and only care about productivity. It was this way in their undergrad too so they perpetuate it. Another reasons is a lot of gsis don't have the same experiences. Quite a bit of gsis come from families of doctors, lawyers, professors etc... so they don't understand the struggles of undergrads Which is not saying the undergrads don't come from these lineages too, but in my experience, a lot of students are first gen and these numbers will continue to rise as since the goblue guarantee. As for me, i too am a first gen student who came from a fellow top institution in undergrad so I can empathize with the first gen and generally less privileged students. Gsis like me understand undergrad is hard enough, and the pandemic is only making it harder, so we're generally more lenient.. . . So part 2, gsi - lecturer relationships. Keep in mind, even the strict gsis aren't necessarily like that naturally. Some professors have harsher expectations on the gsi than on students, so what the gsi is saying may be a reflection of the prof. Some profs are two faced making the gsi the bad one even though the gsi is following their rules. This is especially challenging when the gsi is part of the professors lab, so if they dont follow the prof, they will he retaliated. But some profs dgaf and gsis have autonomy. In the case of my lecturer she was very hands off and as long as all the grades were in on time, she didn't care. I was able to transfer that freedom to students, but others may not be.. . And part 3, professional goals and ethics. Some gsis want to become profs so good reviews by the profs are more important than the students. In my case, i hate academia (because many professors think their classs is the most important one. Lmao chill prof) so prof reviews have little impact on me (the lecturer of this class isn't my advisor). The possibility of burning a bridge with that lecturer didn't matter. For me, i considered my role as a gsi to cultivate to best version of my students, so my ethics wouldn't allow the lecturer to bully the students with more assignments and lack of empathy.

You probably already know about the screenwriting classes, but in case not, they can be very good in terms of getting experience writing screenplays and teleplays. If you take all the screenplay classes the university has to offer, you will come out with two screenplays, a spec script (a script for an already existing TV show meant to be a writing sample), and an original TV pilot. Plus, at least for my intro to screenwriting class, we wrote script coverage, which is what most writing interns do for their internships, so you will be able to not only put that on your resume, but have a sample as well to send to companies. Speaking of internships, you should email Mary Lou about possible internships in the winter and fall (which will most likely be remote). Don't worry about not having experience, I was able to get one for this fall and I most likely have the same experience level as you. Also, don't feel discouraged about not getting into any student film orgs. You can always try again later when you have more know-how under your belt.. . In terms of creative writing, maybe get in contact with orgs like the Gargoyle or Michigan Daily to see if you could potentially write for them down the line.

It wasn't *great,* and I won't remember it as one of my favorite classes, but the exams are designed to allow you to pass (give you multiple questions, you pick which ones you want to answer) and other than that, it's a pretty standard/interesting history class.

School being virtual is hard enough as it is, but with a workload like that I would feel so overwhelmed, not mentioning my significant deficiency in spatial reasoning classes like you're taking right now, i.e chemistry. There's a few tips that I can offer you.. . Firstly, recognize that college isn't a contract on your professional life. Recent data suggests . that a majority of college graduates [don't work in the fields they studied in college.](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/08/02/new-data-track-graduates-six-popular-majors-through-their-first-three-jobs) Does your decision to pursue pre-med derive from a place of serious love for problem solving and the sciences? I'm assuming that your current goal is to be a practitioner of some sort, so these are important things to consider. Your aptitude greatly affects the career choice best suited for you, so if you don't enjoy interacting with people (co-workers and patients) and aren't a big fan of problem solving, pre-med will be a difficult track for you, assuming that you're intellectually competent for it to begin with.. . Secondly, going off of what I just mentioned, seriously give credence to the idea that not everyone is meant for any job. There's no way in hell I could pull off being a doctor or practically anything in the STEM field. Most people can't. IQ is certainly not the end all be all, but I would be lying to you if I said that you can do whatever you put your mind to. The fact of the matter is that time is money here, and although I'm sure if you work hard and long enough, then of course you can become a doctor. The problem is that there's already a guarantee of many years before earning a (admittedly large) income, so it's my opinion that you're better off pursuing something that is more intellectually expedient for you whilst putting you in competition with other people.. . College is a gift for us. We are granted 4 years to have the identity of ""full-time student"". That means that this time can be used to find out as much as we can about ourselves, and one of the principal goals should be to discover our behavioral aptitude and intellectual ineptitude so we have a very strong idea of what the boundaries are for ourselves. Ok, I can't do science or math very well, and I'm kind of a loner. Medicine is off the table for me. And that's totally fine. There's a Western (perhaps American) obsession with STEM being the end all be all for every single person, and although that idea has some precedence and validity, we're not all wired the same. Play to your strengths. I would also advice you to find something that challenges you while catering to your interests. You're only a freshman, so take this time to explore different subjects, though I would be somewhat picky with what you choose. I highly suggest exploring subjects in the humanities, particularly philosophy and history, and other classes like psychology or sociology to see if you would like to pursue something that still incorporates scientific principles. . . I've known several people that were pre-med and realized that it wasn't for them. I believe in you, and I know that you can persevere through this. I don't think you're dumb, and you shouldn't either. Please don't give up. Good luck, my friend.",4.0,error,0.0

All said and done, I agree the Covid is a critical issue that needs to be taken seriously. I agree the administration has fucked it up. I also think that you and frankly many others on this subreddit are too quick to rush judgement on people who are doing low risk activities like going to the gym. The high risk activity was coming back to campus in the first place. THAT increases the risk of spread.

Driving is dangerous. People still do it. Why? Because it's a calculated risk. I'm sorry, but if you want a risk free life, you need to stay home 24/7.

Poniatowski was without a doubt the best professor I've ever had. He was very understanding, very personable, and very dope. You can definitely tell that he cares a lot about his students and he is all around a very chill and cool guy, and if you reach out I'm sure he'll be understanding within reason. . . In reference to chemistry and classes here in general, everyone feels out of place. Everyone is used to being like ""the best"" in their high schools and before college, and then they come here and find out that everyone here is ""the best"" as well. A lot of people get imposter syndrome and feel weird and out of place. A lot of people need to adjust and need time to get it all straight. . . ~Do Not~ give up. Do not let your mind get the best of you. I felt the same way as you do now when I was in Orgo 1. I thought I was set for the first exam and I thought I was ready. I got cocky and took that first exam and got slapped in the face with a 49%. I felt out of place, felt worried that I wouldn't be able to do this. I pulled myself up, got serious, put in the work, and ended up passing the class with an A-. I likewise applied myself for Orgo 2 and got perfect scores on both the first and second exam and got an A overall after studying my ass off. Everyone struggles and everyone feels strange if they fall behind, but don't let that stop you. If getting a college degree was by any means easy then literally everyone would have one. You're here for a reason, you've made it, don't let anyone stop you from being the best person you can be, even yourself. A lot of the time we see that our biggest road blocks are ourselves.

This is based on a. widespread belief that positive results in these tests are highly reliable. However, evidence from external quality assessments and real-world data indicate enough a high enough false positive rate to make positive results highly unreliable over a broad range. of scenarios. This has clinical and case management implications, and affects an array of epidemiological statistics, including the asymptomatic ratio, prevalence, and hospitalization and death rates, as well as epidemiologic models. Steps should be taken. to raise awareness of false positives and reduce their frequency. **The most important immediate action is to check positive results with additional tests, at least when prevalence is low.**. . it even _literally_ says in the body of the paper. . > But more importantly, we should reduce false positive rates. Long-term, this can be done by investigating and improving laboratory and sampling practices. Shorter-term solutions, all of which involve tradeoffs between specificity and sensitivity, include raising the criteria for positive results in PCR tests by lowering the cutoff known as the maximum threshold cycle (Ct), or by selecting tests with primer-probe sets that are less sensitive, which would reduce false positives that result from a low-concentration contamination. Pooled sampling also reduces false positives. **However, a simpler and immediately available approach is to check positive results with additional tests, at least when prevalence is low, such as in the mass-testing of asymptomatic individuals. In such circumstances, requiring two independent positive test results to diagnose an individual as infected greatly reduces the effective false positive rate at the cost of a minimal, often insignificant, increase in the false negative rate.**. . and:. . > The only thing we have is prior virus tests.

I'd really strongly recommend taking EECS 481 early on; it's very much a practical course with a heavy focus on things and concepts you'd actually be doing in industry"", like how code review actually works, code analysis tools, continuous integration, advanced automated testing, and so on. It also gives you lots of practice with being thrown into the deep end of the pool by frantically self-teaching new frameworks, libraries, and tools that you've never been exposed to before, which (speaking seriously) is an essential skill for any programmer.. . 490 (programming languages) also isn't a bad choice: it talks about the formal theory behind how programming languages are designed and implemented, including things like type systems, syntax trees, and parser construction. It nicely complements 481 and 376, introduces you to new programming paradigms (so that you're not completely blindsided in the workplace by ""functional programming"" or whatever), and it gives you a good theoretical background for understanding how you might (e.g.) write a tool to perform automated checks on a config file or similar, which can actually get surprisingly hairy if you don't know what you're doing.. . Beyond that, I'd just say to take whichever courses interest you.

Sometimes you just gotta accept having one really long day to finish the work and hope that once you get caught up you'll get to a better place.. Also: a list of things you can try to motivate yourself:. - record how bad that one catch up night is in some way. Use it to remind yourself next time you say ""I can just do this later"". - write down a goal and stick it to the wall over your desk, use it as a phone background, etc. - if you have a person that motivates you to better yourself, use a phot of them in a similar way to remind yourself to make them proud. It could be your family, significant other, even a pet or a celebrity, whatever makes you find the strength to work past the fatigue. - reward yourself for finishing your to do list and withhold the reward when you don't. Pick something that's hard for you to forgo. If you like to watch a certain show or play a certain video game, don't let yourself until all your tasks are done (I won't let myself play call of duty until my physics homework is done for the day. Heck, even if it's a bad habit like eating junk food or using nicotine or something, use that bad habit to incentivize something positive at least (but don't start or exacerbate a bad habit just for this purpose). - if you do procrastinate, try doing so productively. If you're not gonna do homework, at least take care of some other menial task like cleaning your room or doing laundry so you've accomplished something . - keep a calendar color coded for how productive you were each day. Green days are days where you finished everything, red days are ones you didn't. Seeing each week get more green helps you look back and see how much better you're doing. - note small accomplishments. It's easy to say ""oh all I did was read 10 pages"" or ""I only did 5% better on this quiz than the last one"" but enjoying those accomplishments reminds you that your work is paying of and will continue to do so . - talk to somebody! Find a friend, family member, etc who will just listen. They can't solve your problems but they can 1- help you get it out so you're not so bottled up and 2- provide accountability.

Can you say more about those? . . Here is why I ask. The university has to follow regulations in awarding financial aid. One of the key aspects is accounting for all the costs of your education, and all of your sources to meet your costs. . . Put another way, U Of M doesn't just say ""it seems like you don't have a lot of income so we're just gonna give you this flat figure to help you get through the year."" No, they have to look at what tuition is going to cost you, what room and board is going to cost you, what books are going to cost you. Those costs are what determine what U Of M can provide. They cannot provide need-based aid without documenting what you need to pay for college. If they provide need-based aid that goes beyond the documented need, they cannot award certain kinds of federal aid. UM needs the feds to partner with them in order to meet the needs of this large student body. .

What bothers me about the exam questions is how you end up needing to draw out the whole mechanism start to finish with all the molecules on scratch paper, whereas in the past you only needed to draw the blanks and the rest of the mechanism was provided. They'll ask you what the second mechanistic step is and you'll need to work through the whole thing, and naturally the mechanisms take twists and turns that you need to consider given what answers are provided, which takes up more time.. . . on top of that, you'll usually get a potential answer bank with options A-Z, and its a lot to look through, you need to look at all these different substituents and decide if there is more than 1 suitable reagent in there, and its tedious and easy to miss things. On top of that, it takes time to sift through all the potential options, which when combined with the time sink that is needing to draw the whole mechanism start to finish to have something to reference, each question takes up a lot more time on average. Sure, one can argue that having the discrete answers as choices means people are coerced into thinking a certain way, but it's not really possible to just guess your way through based on the choices. There will still be options in there solely to throw you off, and to pick which one would still require a solid understanding of the material (A coppola level understanding).. . . Just my own experience, I've found I do well when I take a little more time on the questions, but I think the 1.5 hour time constraint was geared towards the old format. I think it should be raised a bit to account for the new format, which requires the students do a lot more to actually set up the question before they can begin to think about answering it. . . . For reference, I'm pretty content with my score. It was high enough over the overall average that I think I can pull off an A by the final exam if I keep it up (and if there is a curve), improving a bit.. . . As far as being blindsided by material, I don't really agree. I think some of the questions are pretty convoluted, but all the questions could be answered with knowledge of the chapters we covered. Like, we did go over the swern oxidation, although a lot of people were probably surprised when he asks about the mechanistic steps for it. Or using Br2 to oxidize an alcohol, or throwing a massive compound with several functional groups that undergoes several steps and asking about product stereochemistry. They're weird and trifling but within the reigns of what we covered. IT would be helpful to have more practice, and the limited coursepack answers are a godsend for that.

Basically was looking for a community of people and I enjoyed going out and meeting guys, etc.. . My sorority was middle tier and carries a ""good"" reputation. However, the people I met were totally not my people. If you really think about it it makes sense: You are basically making friends with people who you are ""supposed"" to be friends with. Like high school, I realized that I was friends with my sorority friends because I was around them a lot and we shared the same going out/boys interests. However, we literally never did anything else besides maybe occasionally going out to eat. . . I ended up dropping after a miserable experience living in my sorority house and I literally talk to 0 people from my ex-sorority. Literally imagine. Like I spent 2 entire years living with these people and after I dropped (not even a dramatic event), nobody spoke to me. I had dozens of girls unfollow me on Instagram. Today, when I see them out, they look the other way. I went into my sophomore year (when I was living in) expecting it to be the best year of my life. Instead, I ended up experiencing the worst part of greek life: catty, mean, judgmental girls who would talk about you constantly behind your back. Besides the people I met, the structure of sororities are incredibly messed up. Basically, you are paying a ton of money to be in a house with a babysitter. You are penalized (fined a fuck ton of money) for having alcohol in your room, having boys over, etc. Basically normal college things. . . I know there are many great people in the greek system (my bf is!), but fair warning- many upperclassmen drop their sorority for related reasons. I think most sororities lose at least 1/3-1/2 of their juniors and seniors. . . I joined Greek Life because I was looking for a community. If that is what you are looking for, look elsewhere. I joined a co-op and it has literally been the best decision I have made during my time at Michigan. I wish I could go back in time and tell my baby freshman self not to rush, and instead join a co-op.

You can see on the course guide what classes you'd be interested in taking, they have a wide range for every subfield. In terms of preparation for a PhD, it's fairly easy to get a position doing research either on your own or through UROP. You can email virtually any professor you want, and it's likely that at least someone will let you work with them. Additionally, the department has a few methods courses (300, 381, 490, 499), and these are what you should be taking if you're interested in graduate school. They also let you take the graduate methods courses if you have the necessary math background. So if you want to go to graduate school, there are few places that can set you up so well. Another great thing is that the people writing your rec letters may the top people in their specific areas like Dr. Tessler and Dr. Mebane. Just a tip for the PhD, take as many math, cs, and stats classes as you can specifically (eecs 183, 203, and 280, math 115, 116, 215, and 214 or 217, stats 412 (instead of 250), and even better stats 425 and 426 instead of 412 if you end up enjoying math and want to do methods. It looks like a lot, but it's not awful, and a lot of the current research is very methods heavy, which is also the one of the better subfields for the job market.. . edit: pro tip is to take the AP exam for US and comparative gov. Even if your school does not offer them, they are both fairly easy to self study (I self-studied comparative about three days before the exam), and since you only need a 3 for credit, you will likely get it. Because of that I didn't have to take the intro courses, and I have never felt at a disadvantage because of that.

Firstly, don't let doing poorly in intro classes discourage you from majoring in CS. A lot of students don't do as well as they would like in the early classes (EECS 280, EECS 203, EECS 281) but do fine in upper levels. These are really the first challenging classes for CS majors to take and it definitely may take you a semester or two to really ""hit your stride"" and figure out how to do well in challenging courses. It's not uncommon for students to retake those courses. I would really only discourage someone from majoring in CS if they really don't enjoy the field or want a career in something unrelated - but atleast from reading your post it seems like you would enjoy a career in CS so I would atleast try to tough it out in the mean time.. . Secondly, don't compare yourself to other students in CS. Honestly I think there are some pretty significant equity issues in computer science - I know I personally came into the uofm with a lot of the math background for EECS 203 while other students had no clue what was going on. I think this is a big reason there is a large disparity between student success in the early intro courses. . . Thirdly - ""Abuse"" office hours. I'm an IA for another EECS course and I imagine that most other IA's would be more than willing to help a student out. Back when I took EECS 203 I went to the same office hours block every single week. This really helped me keep on track with the homework even if I wasn't super motivated to do it.

I love programming; I started playing around with code in Game Maker Studio in 6th grade, and I loved taking EECS 183 last fall. I fail to see how this class is even in the EECS department. . . This can be explained. A CS degree is not a coding degree. Computer science is very broad, but at the very core, it's historically been a math discipline. Theory courses like 203 and 376 are what separates a CS degree from a coding bootcamp - not that there's anything wrong with coding bootcamps, they have their place, but they're not CS degrees.. . . . I feel like my point is: 203 feels pointless to you because there's this misconception that if you want to do programming, you have to do a CS degree. That's wrong - **there are *many* pathways to a career in programming, and it's totally a myth to think that a CS degree is the only one**. A CS degree is a pathway to programming for one kind of student, but if you're not that student, don't try to fit a square peg into a round hole. A *lot* of students come into CS who don't care about theory at all, that just want to do programming. And then they get frustrated with the theory courses. The source of the issue is that a classical CS degree is maybe not for them. There are other options, like a degree in Software Engineering (idk if the uni offers one). . . . . A CS degree at a top university is bound to have tons of math.

My questions is why do you want to double major in two extremely unrelated fields? Most likely, you'll only use one as a career, so your time would be better used making and maintaining connections for your specialty. For me, I wanted to be a recording artist and engineering was my more practical back up. While I had some formal training in my highschool choir and relatives, I didn't realize how demanding voice performance was as college major. Engineering was also a demanding major so my free time was very little and it affected me. It was difficult setting up practice sessions when I had other classes to contend with and my performances were really get in and get out for similar reasons. I couldn't make connections with big players. . . . In my case, I dropped voice ultimately because I realized I hated the music industry. I had no ambition to be a teacher, director etc... I wanted to go into music because I liked performing, but I didn't want my livelihood to be determined by the gig economy. So I dropped after 2 years and focused on engineering.

I don't know the full situation, but it doesn't seem like a very fair response from the information I have to work with. On top of that, social isolation is hard, especially when the only people one can interact with are one's parents, whom it is not always easy to talk with. I would try to candidly explain the situation with them if it comes up again, or, it might be best not to discuss it with them at all if this is the type of response that you will always get, since it's obviously not helpful to you. I would still try again and make a really solemn effort to communicate with them about the difficulties you're facing. If nothing good comes out of that, then maybe talking to your parents about your school struggles is not a worthwhile thing to do anymore, as unfortunate as it is. I know that that is a hard thing to do as parents are valuable supports, especially when they're the only people you can interact with during this time, but you do have to keep in mind what will help you be more successful in your endeavors, and the ""he doesn't study at all"" feedback is obviously not helpful for you. Also note that if you do genuinely put in all the hard work you do (I can't verify this since I don't know you, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt) and you can effectively communicate/demonstrate that to your parents and if they still give you that response, then it doesn't say anything about you; it just says something about them. My point in saying this is not to degrade your parents but to encourage you to not feel bad if you've done everything in your power to be the best you can be and it just isn't being recognized by your parents. You're doing the best you can do, and you know that, and that's what matters; it doesn't matter what other people think. Overall, know that the situation you are in is a difficult one, and it is normal to struggle with it. Try your best to find a course of action that will lead you to the best outcome.

While I understand that Michigan is a renowned school, I would then expect instructors to be better and have good classes that doesn't require a large curve for students to pass. If that is occurring, more often that not people will tell you it's because of poor teaching, not the students. I would also agree with a comment below saying that it can be a mismanaged class that makes it hard for no reason. I've seen a lot of people complaining about Math 215, and from the way it seems very poorly managed this semester, I don't think they're wrong to do so.. . Also the idea of weeder classes is kind of messed up to begin with. If someone changes their major, they should change it because they're truly not interested in the material, not because of one course that absolutely wrecked them. If you don't like the amount of math and physics involved in engineering, then yeah maybe it's not for you. But just because one mismanaged course is hard for you doesn't mean you should just change your course of study. There's also many cases where academic advisors will literally tell you to take the course at a CC rather than Michigan because it's hard for no reason here. I don't think any course should be designed as harder than it needs to be in order to ""weed out"" students and make them struggle. Physics and Math and EECS and many other course are yes, hard material to learn to start with, but no class should be harder than it actually needs to be.. . My advisor told me to take Physics 240 at a CC instead of Michigan. And i'm very glad I did because I did well in the course. The information was provided in a straightforward manner and the homework was not always easy, but i could understand it by reviewing the material or going to office hours. And that's really all it should take. No one should be leaving office hours more confused than when you got there, and no one should have to go to office hours all the time to pass a class, especially if it's literally all the students in the course.

Speaking very very broadly, in graduate school you have more control over your education than you do in undergrad. Programs are generally less prescriptive and you can focus in a much more specific area. Some Master's degrees will also incorporate research as part of the degree, a PhD is a research based degree. Even if you did research as an undergraduate you were likely working under the direction of a faculty member, post-doc, or PhD student. As a graduate student, especially a PhD student, you are more in the driver's seat on deciding the type of work you will do (at least you should be, some faculty advisors are definitely more controlling). . . As for the application process, many Master's programs have an application process similar to the undergrad one. It is heavily based on your academic record in undergrad and you contribute a few statements and some faculty recommendations. For a research based degree many programs will focus not only on your qualifications (including prior research experience) and potential, but your fit with their faculty. If you want to study topic A, B, or C as a PhD student but U-M doesn't have anybody that could support you in those areas, then you probably wouldn't want to go there, and they wouldn't be able to help you find success. . . In thinking about choosing a school find places that are best equipped to support what your goals are (facilities, faculty research area, course offerings, etc). For example I have a Master's in Higher Education from Eastern.

t1_g8qq1yr,2020-10-13 22:58:10,t3_jajopv,t3_jajopv,"First, there's usually a difference between a Masters and a PhD. Masters degrees tend to devote fewer resources to funding students (though not always); many Masters students take out loans and pay tuition. With PhDs, at least at places like Michigan, you're usually funded by your department: they typically cover your tuition, and you are also given money for living expenses through fellowships, working as a research assistant, or working as a GSI/GSSA. Because we have a labor union (GEO), when you are a GSI or GSSA you have a guaranteed minimum salary through the GEO contract, although some departments supplement the salary. You also get free health insurance, tuition waivers, etc through the contract (although if you are working fewer than a certain number of hours you may not qualify for the tuition waiver). So, departments tend to see PhD students as investments. Masters students do not always get treated as well and are sometimes left on their own for funding, although if they can secure a GSI position, that helps a lot.. . *App process*. . It depends a lot on the department! Some departments at UM don't require the GRE; others do. Some require GRE subject tests; others don't. But, in the humanities, you'll usually want an academic writing sample, and it helps to have written a thesis or have done an independent research project, especially for a PhD. Where you went for undergrad matters, but not necessarily in the ways you'd think -- if someone at your undergrad knows people in the department you're applying to, or if your mentor went to the school, that tends to lend considerable weight. Your GPA matters, but in the humanities it's part of a holistic process. Check with other people in the field about your GPA.. . *How is it different?*. . Again, it depends on the field -- and also the program. People in humanities PhDs tend to be hoping for academic jobs on the other side, with ""alt-ac"" being used mostly derisively to refer to positions that PhDs get outside of academia; in the social sciences that can be true, but less so. Some people may end up working at think tanks or in policy and that's not necessarily seen as a bad outcome, often it's a desirable one. In my experience STEM PhDs, especially engineers, see going into academia as *less* desirable.. . In my humanities program, there are two years of coursework, with a handful of required classes and the rest being at your own discretion based on your research interests. After that, you have your fourth-term review. In some places this involves exams, but in my program it involved writing papers based on a series of prompts from my advisors, based on my area of interest. Then you go on to write a prospectus, which is sort of like a proposal for your dissertation. You typically spend your remaining time (ABD, ""all but dissertation"") working on your dissertation, which is a book-length piece of research divided into chapters. Some departments want you to publish 3 articles rather than write a dissertation, or give you that option. When you're ABD, there is usually a limit to how many classes you can take a semester. In my department I think it's just one per semester. The rest of your time you're supposed to spend researching, writing, and teaching -- and preparing for an anemic job market.. . *How do you choose grad school?*. . Often, based on funding. Not all grad schools support their grad students adequately. Some give you a first-year fellowship, others ask you to teach right away. Also, you typically want to go somewhere where there's a faculty member you want to work with. If you're interested in 18th-century Japanese art, you're not going to apply to an art history department that only has people who study Western art; you'll track down that renowned 18th-century Japanese art historian with a shit-ton of influential articles and go where they are.",5.0,error,0.0

In other words, non-majority students (from my experience) typically struggle with the same sorts of things that would give you trouble in any difficult STEM course: study habits, inaccessible instruction, elitism from their classmates, derision or dismissiveness from instructors when they try to ask for help, and so on. They might appreciate references to real-world social problems in their assignments, but that would be of little help if they don't understand the lecture topics needed to even _start_ the project in the first place.. . This isn't to say that adding real-world context to programming assignments can't help, but I'd expect better results from more substantial pedagogical changes to accommodate the learning needs of non-majority students: like hiring more TAs to make office hours help more accessible without hours-long wait times; or holding optional instructional workshops to cover skills that long-time programmers have probably already developed (pragmatic debugging techniques; figuring out mysterious error messages using Google and StackOverflow) but which aren't explicitly covered in intro courses.",22.0,negative,0.490507036447525

Broadly, I think the suggestion of many commenters that these implementations wouldn't be worthwhile because the issue is ""systemic"" kind of misses the point. While true that the issues are systemic, changes like these are relatively small ones that department can make and potentially have a great impact. To quote another commenter, ""the work does not start at universities"", and this can limit the types of impact the University can have. But looking the ""Start of EECS 183"" column vs ""End of EECS 376"" column in [this report](https://cse-diversity.engin.umich.edu/reports/cse-climate-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-report/), we can see that there is work that can presently & actively be done by the department to improve DEI in CS. Rejection of small changes just because the issue is ""big and complex"" is a dismissal of the issue, in my opinion. (this [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPFuHS6aPhw) brings up some great similar points about combatting some of these issues from the ground up by eliminating toxic programmer culture).. . I do have a couple questions on some of the points you bring up. I'm not very well versed in computing education, but is there truly a better way to teach a DS&Alg course than to give questions which data structures and algorithms? When I took the class, it was never explicitly mentioned that these problems were from Leetcode, and if anything, these are essentially the types of practice problems you might find in a textbook like CLRS. Are you suggesting that 281 not feature these types of questions at all (lab or exam)? I think that the types of coding assessments during software engineering position recruiting are terribly misguided, but to not teach these types of problems & thinking in the curriculum feels like a misstep. . . I agree that emphasizing communal goals in projects is an easy way to modify the class in a purely beneficial way. EECS 280 does a good job at theming its projects in a way that gets students excited about different applications of technology (computer vision, machine learning, web systems, games). Currently, the theme of 281 projects is just a thin wrapper over the core project, and in some cases as you mention is a bit reinforcing of interests of the predominant CS demographic. I think 281 could easily use the theme of their projects as an opportunity to expose students to, as you say, computing education research, communal goal-oriented themes, or health sectors.. . Finally, I am curious how you believe other introductory or core computing classes at Michigan fare. . . Also, if anyone would like to read the studies mentioned in the OP, I *believe* [this](http://blogs.hmc.edu/lewis/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/Lewis_2019_CommunalGoals.pdf) is one (though I haven't read it yet).. . edit: typo",2.0,error,0.0

Because I have seen stuff like this posted several times and I honestly don't understand it. Are you really saying that a virus already this widespread and this contagious would just disappear if everyone followed the guidelines? . . How do you explain the fact that according to the CDC 74% of people diagnosed with the corona virus reported always wearing masks and 85% almost always wore masks? It almost seems as though people who are being cautious and ""taking it seriously"" can still catch it. . . Did you forget the fact that lockdowns and other measures were introduced to flatten the curve, and not eliminate the virus? We were told roughly the same number of people would get it, just more spread out over time. The preventative measures that make the curve flatter also cause it to extend out further, simply putting off further infections. So how are people getting the idea that it would be over now if more people had followed the guidelines? . . I also find it ironic that you, the supposed compassionate one, are telling someone to ""Go fuck yourself with a fucking red hot piece of rebar"" simply because you have a different opinion. . . Sure, calling it ""essentially harmless"" is a stretch, but he is absolutely right about how much harm the lockdowns and other measures have caused, whether it is delayed surgeries, job losses (which are strongly correlated with bad health outcomes) , people scared to seek medical treatment, increases in domestic violence, increased alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, mental health problems, extreme poverty and starvation in developing countries, setbacks in medical research and overall strain on society. . . Because of this, the risk of the virus, although real, needs to be into some perspective and if you compare to other risks we take on a daily bases, for example driving, you find that for people under 45 it's in the same ballpark as the risk of dying in a car accident and for college age students it's even less of a risk. . . Older people do need to be protected but it is possible that he doesn't have much contact with older people. The whole ""you're gonna spread it to old people"" doesn't make a lot of sense if you don't see old people on a regular bases. If masks and socially distancing work, there is no reason to think he'll spread it to old people by going to the store or walking around and of course those older people have the option to shop during senior hours or get curbside pickup. Several leading epidemiologists have recently made the argument that it is possible to work on protecting the old and vulnerable people while allowing young and healthy people to get back to a more normal way of life and that this is a better long term strategy. . .

I understand what you are saying a little better now, I still don't agree with everything but I do appreciate your response.. . To your point about masks, I'd say that mask compliance indoors is quite high right now. When I go to stores, dentists, doctors everyone is wearing a mask so it shouldn't be too hard to avoid people who aren't wearing masks. That's why I don't buy the argument that it's the people not wearing masks who are responsible for spreading it to those who are. Secondly, aren't N95 masks supposed to protect the wearer as well? Why aren't those being promoted more? Instead any random piece of cloth will do. It seems to me that if masks actually work, then we should be promoting or even providing the highest qualify affordable masks to people.. . Regarding Sweden, protecting the elderly is actually not what they tried to do. If you ask Agnes Tegnell what mistakes Sweden made, the first thing he will tell you is they failed to protect their nursing homes, which have accounted for nearly 50% of their deaths. Secondly, I am not sure when the last time you checked Sweden's mortality rate was but I am guessing it was a long time ago because they are currently ranked 13th in the world with 580 deaths per million. It should be noted that this is lower than the USA (663) and lower than Michigan (733 deaths per million) despite our 3 month long lockdown and mask orders here. In Sweden they don't even wear masks. If masks and lockdowns are highly effective measures against this virus, how is possible that Sweden has a lower death rate than Michigan? Check out this recent video of public transport in Sweden, not a mask in sight: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnmTDPF8Tgk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnmTDPF8Tgk). . Regardless of what anyone thinks about Sweden, I think it is worth recalling the fact that we were told by ""experts"" that if Sweden didn't lock down it would be a total bloodbath, 100,000 thousand deaths were predicted by July , to date less than 6,000 have died. Given that, I don't understand how anyone can call Sweden's strategy a failure, let alone a disaster as some have. Remember the supposed purpose of lockdowns was to prevent immanent disaster and hospitals being overrun, not to ""hopefully lower the death rate a bit"". Obviously, lowering the death rate was and is an important goal but it does need to be weighed against the societal harms caused by the lockdowns and it seems like the efficacy of lockdowns may have been over estimated. . . I agree the lockdowns here are largely over and you're right that restaurants would be struggling regardless. I actually have seen long lines outside the Brown Jug and Joe's pizza. As for other restaurants, I don't really recall seeing long lines outside them even before the corona virus but many restaurants are struggling right now if they haven't closed already. I guess my point is, we don't need to demonize those who point out that the virus isn't as dangerous as some people are making it out to be, like for instance people talking ""risking their lives"" if indoor dining opens in the university dining halls. The risk isn't orders of magnitude greater than the other risks they face. I mean if I told an employer I shouldn't have to ""risk my life"" driving to work every day I would be regarded as paranoid. That's why I feel like there needs to be some perspective, otherwise you can justify absolutely anything in the name of safety. . .

He knows that his students are at school while he's on zoom and he also sees them pull down their masks to talk when they aren't alone in the room and says nothing. . -There's a recording of a singer without a mask made this sem in the music building, but I don't have access to distribute it. It exists tho and has been confirmed by the pianist!. -there is a performance class going on that lasts anywhere from an hour and a half to two hours led by a voice faculty member and all of their students have confirmed that this Professor does not observe room rests. A cursory questioning of voice students who are in a performance class could confirm this.. -GSIs in the music school have made public posts on FB about the GSI contract email, with one even posting in Umich memes for wolverteens about it.. -I don't have any tangible proof about Gier's commentary besides my firsthand account but I have heard of another source who spoke publicly about it . -There are still new mask kits in the backstage area of McIntosh theatre. -The claims about the dovo chair looking for non-compliant faculty have been corroborated by multiple students and have already been brought to Gier.. -the other claims of his efforts to change graduation requirements for some students have been corroborated by students and for my own case, I have an email exchange with an advisor saying that what he has said about a requirement was not true. . -I also have email exchanges and audio recordings demonstrating that some professors don't know how he is dealing with course requirements and waivers. (This only applies to voice btw). -for the class classification thing, there's a conducting class that people were told at first was an academic class, but now it's considered a performance class, which allows it to go longer? And there's a performance class which people are trying to argue is like a studio class meaning they don't need to observe the room rest (despite the fact that when a studio class is in that same room, they need to observe a room rest??? It's all fucked) but I can't show proof without outing ppl.. . I know this isn't enough and I wish I could give you more. But I am already at odds with so many of the music department faculty over this that I can't risk anything.",15.0,error,0.0

There are a bunch of caveats attached to that, though. The biggest, IMO, is that a respirator's effectiveness is determined by the efficiency of its filter media _and_ how well it seals against the wearer's face (which is called ""fit"").. . One of the major risks of reusing a disposable N95 is that, over time and being repeatedly donned/doffed, the material loses its stiffness and structure, and the respirator no longer fits well. When that happens, contaminated air can leak in between your face and the edge of the respirator.. . That's part of why I recommend a [reusable respirator](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Respirator-6300-Respiratory-Protection/dp/B007JZ1MK6); they won't suffer that degradation and loss of fit over time, and you can replace the [filters](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Cartridge-60926-Respiratory-Protection/dp/B009POHLRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) if they get damaged. (It's also more protective: a P100 filter is strictly better than N95, in terms of filtration and durability.). . But even an ill-fitting N95 respirator should still be _much_ more protection than a standard cloth mask or surgical mask, so you should _definitely_ be wearing the respirators if you aren't already.. . (But if those respirators have exhalation valves, then make sure to wear a surgical mask over top of them, so that you're still protecting the people around you in case you're infected but aren't yet presenting symptoms.)",5.0,negative,0.49549350142478943

Students are focused on the student experience; this is both understandable and appropriate. They are only there for a short time out of their lives, but they are making intense investment of time and energy while there (also $$) and the college and campus is something they are living and breathing. It's a huge part of their existence; naturally their focus will be on what things are like on campus for students during the time that they are there.. . Administrators are charged with making decisions about the current student experience, and they care about that (despite what some think). However, they are also responsible for making decisions about, and understanding the impacts of those decisions, on a lot of other stakeholders and issues. Even in we just stick to the student realm, administrators have to think about how decisions will impact all students (sometimes what's great for one set of students is bad for others) or for the students who will be on campus next year and the year after that. . . Beyond students, admins have to consider faculty, staff, alumni, voters (if public), state legislators (ditto), the local community, donors, etc. They have to think about issues like the university's reputation, access, diversity, sustainability, state & federal compliance, what the University is going to be like in 10 years, 50 years, and 100 years... you get the idea. Some of these interests and priorities align, but some of them conflict with each other. Decision-making and policy-setting by administrators are often trying to thread the needle. There can be constraints imposed by laws and regulations as well. Sometimes the decision the administration makes when they attempt to balance multiple priorities is a decision that doesn't seem like a good one to the student who comes at with the student worldview. . . Let me be clear, this doesn't mean that every decision or policy is justified or would be judged a great decision by students if they better understood all the factors. Judgment calls get made all the time, sometimes they are just wrong. And how one weighs certain factors is subjective.. . I have worked at colleges and universities my whole career, and I don't think I can recall knowing a campus leader who I thought was callous and did not give a shit about students, or were the things I hear administrators are supposed to be (evil, greedy, etc).

The first thing I want to ask is are you conflating first time student with first generational student? I ask because how your source describes first time student as a student who never attended college. However, a first generation student according to [U of M](https://oami.umich.edu/partnerships/first-generation-initiatives/) is a ""college student with parents who did not finish a 4 year degree"" so while first gen students are often first time students, not all first time students are first gen students. This distinction is critical because these stats alone don't capture the experience of first gen students. A question I think of when looking at the 8% drop out rate is how many of that % is first generation students? Are first generation students disproportionally affected? These stats alone don't tell that story, although intuition would suggest yes due to first gens more likely to [drop](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018421.pdf) out [more](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/08/students-postsecondary-education-arcs-affected-parents-college-backgrounds-study) than their [peers](http://www.firstgenerationfoundation.org/#:~:text=Nationally%2C%2089%20percent%20of%20low,-income%20second-generation%20students) . . . Next, analyzing u of m, first generation students are grossly underrepresented. According to the [student profile](https://admissions.umich.edu/apply/first-year-applicants/student-profile) 16% of undergrads are first gen; however, 56 % of undergrad [students](https://firstgen.naspa.org/research-and-policy/national-data-fact-sheets-on-first-generation-college-students/national-data-fact-sheets) nationally, are first generation students. So why is this important? Well, it shows that your stat needs to be taken with a grain of salt. while a 92% retention rate is phenomenal, it needs to be understood that part of this high stat is because u of m doesn't have that many first gen students to begin with. . . . Since the uni doesn't have stats that show how may first gen drop, I'll assume for argument first gens are dropping out similar at similar rates to their peers. so why is this? . . . First lets look at the challenges facing first gen students from getting a college degree. . . . A primary challenge is [lack of academic preparedness](https://serc.carleton.edu/sage2yc/firstgen/challenges.html). Studies have shown first gen students often have lower gpa and standardized test scores than their peers. However according to the student profile the median gpa for freshmen is 3.9 and the 50% percentile for sat is 1380-1560 and the act is 32-35 which is the 95th percentile I may add. . . . So the reality is... most first gen students don't get admitted to u of m. And those who do are exceptional students to begin with, inspite of their first gen status. . . . But even so, that doesn't capture the full experience of first gen. . . . Many first gen students feel out of place due to racial disparity, or not fitting in due to differences in socio economics. This is very true at michigan. 4% of the student body is black and 7% latinx according to the [michigan almana](https://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/factsfigures/2019_OBP_Infographic.pdf)c . On top of that, 68 and 81% of the student body have families with incomes over 100K a year for in state and out of state student respectively. This can be extremely isolating for first gen student. Some A first gen have even considered themselves [inivisible](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1538192711430382). Even with more programs set up for first gen popping up, it doesn't counteract the effect of the majority of the student body. . . . It's late and I need to sleep soon, so i'll end it here. . . . A large indicator of success for first gens is grit and [resilience](https://digscholarship.unco.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1459&context=dissertations).

In terms of vague rules, ill cite the CLAM, residents can have no more than 10 guests in their rooms if social distancing permits. (granted, thats not a direct quote. But its close enough). This is vague in the sense that it doesn't explicitly state how many from the same dorm guests are reasonably allowed into a room. . . We also had a rule that stated, ""you may only leave the building for purposeful activities."" Upon requesting for the definition of ""purposeful,"" we were told, ""you are adults, use your judgement."" . . Another example would be in the bathrooms, we were told to only remove masks when absolutely necessary. Again, when further explanation was asked for, there was no explanation given.. . We were told not to use common areas or places labeled with a ""do not sit here sign."" However, these locations are mostly unlocked and there is no enforcement from anyone about this. Again... we were informed that these are ""lenient rules"" and to not enforce them.. . Mask wearing in dorms is a mess. At the beginning of the year mask wearing was very poorly enforced (I concede your second point, but hear me out). This weak enforcement was because the rule wasn't clear about if mask wearing should be all the time or only if social distancing or in rooms or etc.... . Markley was told that every resident had to get mandatory testing, however, it was made quite difficult to sign up and no one explained who was exempt from testing and who had to get tested. This led to some residents skip their testing as they had been tested already.. . A lot of residents were told after they tested positive that they have antibodies and don't need to worry about mask wearing and etc. However this directly contradicts the rules given by housing.. . For community center staffing of RAs, they are given vague rules about when they can work, how many people can work, and where they can work. Many RAs work in multiple buildings. Heck, there are some Markley RAs who worked in MOJO for the first few days Markley was in lock down. . . This is all to say that yin housing the rules are quite vague. At least in ny experience. . I agree with your second point now, I guess I just didnt expect freshman to follow these rules and regulations as they came to college this year to have fun (on average). . . I would like to add that spending even one night weekend in Markley would open people's eyes to how little some of these freshman care about covid policies. Yes, I agree they should be held responsible. But... im not sure how to finish my thought lol.. . I think at the end of the day, while people should be expected to follow these rules, I believe that the rules should have been created by taking into account how most people will behave. Everyone knew from day 1 that the reopening plan was a suicide run. So whats the point of creating rules that you know would be broken anyways? Its like telling people who are attempting to lose weight, ""hey, don't eat food for the next month."" Obviously that rule will be broken as its not sustainable. This is why the RAs were pushing for broader testing. This would allow for people to be more lax with the rules, as we could isolate the vectors quicker. Adding on to that, over the summer the plan was to do 10k tests a week. That number quickly fell down to 3k. Im not sure what led to that decision, but I believe that more frequent testing of students could have led to better isolation and quarantining of sick students. . . To add to this, the iso/quar housing conditions were abysmal and are now only marginally improves. I know many people who are hesitant to get tested as they don't want to be forced to live there.

Faced with a steep rise in Covid-19 cases, the local county health department has issued an emergency ""stay in place"" order for all undergraduates at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, effective immediately.. . . . The decision by the Washtenaw County Health Department -- which was supported by university officials -- comes after a series of dorm outbreaks that fueled a dramatic increase in cases of the virus on campus.. . . . The surge in infections on the campus contributed to a ""critical"" situation overall in Ann Arbor, according to local health officials, who noted that university students now represent more than 60 percent of local cases.. . . . Some of that Covid spread is a result of Michigan students partying irresponsibly. But university leaders have also been roundly criticized for failing to take enough precautions when reopening.. . . . The 14-day health-department order allows students to attend class, but they cannot socialize. The order will not affect the University of Michigan Wolverines' football schedule.. . . . . . University officials on Tuesday pledged to provide additional safety options for students and instructors, including moving more undergraduate courses to online instruction for the remainder of the semester.. . . . This latest effort to control Covid at Michigan may or may not work. But in the meantime, frustrations on campus are growing.. . . . Sophie Clark is a University of Michigan freshman who lives in Mary Markley Hall. The mixed-gender dorm houses hundreds of students and has long had a reputation for a lively social scene.. . . . ADVERTISEMENT. . That's not a good thing during Covid-19. In fact, Clark calls it ""terrifying."". . . . ""People have been going to parties every weekend, they've been having parties in the dorms,"" Clark, 18, said. ""Pretty much nothing has been done about it. Students who get caught with other students in their rooms haven't really faced any punishment."". . . . Coronavirus cases are soaring at Markley Hall, and that increase is part of a larger surge happening all across campus. Michigan reported more than 900 new Covid-19 cases during the past four weeks.. . . . More than 100 students in Markley have been relocated to isolation or quarantine housing because of either a positive test result or possible exposure to the coronavirus. At all dorms combined, a total of 259 students are isolated or quarantined.. . . . The rising student cases have strained the surrounding Ann Arbor community -- at times overwhelming community testing sites.. . . . Critics say the university's fall reopening has been a disaster.. . . . ""We continue, day in and day out, to remind administrators of the issues that we're seeing on the front lines,"" said Soneida Rodriguez, a resident adviser at one of the university's smaller dorms. ""The policies are not working, this is not going well, and we're not seeing change quickly enough."". . . . Rick Fitzgerald, a University spokesman, said via email that Michigan is ""rapidly following up on documented nonobservance of public health rules. Measures range from educational conversations to housing probation and contract termination."". . . . ADVERTISEMENT. . The two-week stay-in-place order for all undergraduates comes on the heels of an emergency order directed specifically at Markley Hall residents. Last weekend university administrators joined county health officials in announcing a 14-day quarantine for all residents.. . . . The university ordered students to attend classes online for two weeks, and to ""only leave your room when necessary to obtain food, use the bathroom, or in the case of emergency."". . . . The quarantine order said that a ""high proportion of residents"" had not participated in mandatory Covid testing, which therefore made more drastic action necessary.. . . . Your metrics of success should not be, How quickly can we get things open? It should be, How quickly can we get this spread of Covid-19 under control?. . Were those irresponsible students ""scared straight"" by the quarantine? Not necessarily.. . . . About 15 minutes after the notice arrived, Clark saw three female students leaving the residence hall. The trio were headed to a party, Clark said. And they were laughing about it.. . . . In an interview with The Chronicle, Clark expressed frustration with her fellow students, but she was also appalled at university leadership.. . . . ""It's negligence,"" Clark said of the administration.. . . . ADVERTISEMENT. . ""They have the option to enforce housing guidelines,"" she continued. ""They have the ability to punish students with more than just a slap on the wrist ... they have the power to actually promote safety. But they're just not."". . . . Fitzgerald, the university spokesman, said Michigan ""has been closely monitoring conduct and accountability for reported COVID-19 related violations since the beginning of the semester, with a strategic focus on residence halls. Each reported violation is addressed within 48 hours with assignment of restorative measures along with probation or even contract termination depending on the nature of the violation. In most cases, our students are very responsive to restorative measures as we have had a very low occurrence of repeat offenders."". . . . Student partying is probably not the only reason for Michigan's dorm outbreaks. Other possible factors include the university's decision to reopen student housing at 70 percent capacity -- a higher percentage than some other colleges.. . . . The university also failed to aggressively enforce its safety measures for move-in day, such as requiring students to show a negative Covid test result. The Michigan Daily student newspaper also documented multiple instances of students roaming the hallways without masks on, even when housing staff was nearby. A two-person limit on riding the elevator wasn't enforced either.. . . . ""There's just no follow-through,"" one freshman student told the newspaper in August.. . . . Michigan's fall semester began with resident advisers expressing frustration over unsafe working conditions. The administration was at times dismissive of those concerns.. . . . When resident advisers asked for more Covid testing, for example, Robert Ernst, director of University Health Services, questioned the effectiveness of large-scale testing.. . . . ""Having a test doesn't prevent you from getting Covid,"" he told the RAs at an August town hall.. . . . ADVERTISEMENT. . The following month, RAs at Michigan went on strike. They refused to work for nearly two weeks, until a deal was reached that gave them priority status for surveillance testing, while also providing each RA with a box of 50 masks, every 45 days.. . . . But Rodriguez, the resident adviser, said those concessions haven't fixed an underlying problem: The university appears more concerned with giving students the full ""college experience"" than with protecting public health, she said.. . . . ""They're trying to justify the tuition price,"" she said.. . . . One example cited by Rodriguez: continuing discussions about whether to reopen common areas in the dorms, such as study lounges, workout rooms, and dining halls.. . . . ""I don't think having this mass reopening of common space is the right approach, which is what they want to do,"" Rodriguez said. ""Your metrics of success should not be, How quickly can we get things open? It should be, How quickly can we get this spread of Covid-19 under control?"". . . .

Football is the university's priority because of the money it brings in, plain and simple, and while I understand why the university (and the B1G, and the NCAA, and the networks, and Trump) are willing to push hard for Football to happen, saying ""we need these tests for the athletes to play safely"" and ""you don't need these tests to safely go to classes or your school-sanctioned 25-person parties"" undermines the legitimacy of anything the university says regarding COVID on campus. People are salty because the *school* is admitting (through their actions) that the athletic program is more important to them than protecting in-person instruction and that's where all the resources are going.. . If people are directing their anger at the players, I don't think they deserve that. But the people who are calling the shots have to answer for the choices they make, and be honest with the students if they expect anyone to take them (or their restrictions) seriously. UM underprepared for COVID, and the B1G botched their season by cancelling games while things were okay and waiting for the Midwest to start spiking again to begin playing.. . I plan to watch the game Saturday, but it doesn't mean I don't still have my complaints. If the school made investments like UIUC did to expand regular testing to all students (On perhaps a weekly basis?) I think most of my concerns would be alleviated.

I don't know if I buy this; people also complain every semester about EECS 280, 281, and 370, and that doesn't necessarily mean that those courses are intrinsically flawed. It could also just mean (for instance) that the courses are taken by a large body of students who find the courses challenging and need to vent.. . > I've only used recursion (which was also covered in-depth in 280 IIRC) and big-O notation in my programming classes.. . Have you taken 281? I remember needing a decent amount of graph theory for project 4. . . > Everything else has been utterly useless (induction, set notation, TMs) among the core programming requirements. . 203 and 376 don't necessarily have direct and obvious practical applications to day-to-day programming work, but the concepts that they cover do actually come up in ULCS courses and (of course) in 281.. . 481 brings up the Halting Problem in the context of ""why can we not write a code linter that just straight up tells you whether your code is correct""; comparators for a 281-style ADT like a max-heap are used to define partial orderings, and I think that the docs on cppreference literally mention ""partial ordering"" in that context. Finite state machines come up in the context of language parsing and compiler design, and so on.. . I actually brought up decidability during design meetings at my Amazon internship, since I was pretty sure that an idea that another engineer had floated during brainstorming was actually formally undecidable and therefore impossible to implement.. . > more pathways instead of a traditional CS major for people that are more interested in the programming-only side of it.. . I wouldn't hold my breath for this to happen. The department is already massively and hilariously overcrowded; there's little incentive to let students skip prereqs when a course like machine learning might literally have a waitlist five hundred students long.. . It sounds like you're looking for a purely vocational software engineering degree or curriculum. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, by itself, but it's worth remembering that 203 and 376 are essentially cliffsnotes for basic theoretical computer science, and they even skip over material that might get covered by other CS departments (like regular languages, formal grammars, finite state transducers, etc.) Not having that background would appreciably limit your ability to work on more ""interesting"" engineering problems, since they'll usually touch on cutting-edge theory in at least _some_ way, which (in the worst case) would be something of a hard ceiling to your growth even as a ""pure"" software engineer.",36.0,error,0.0

I look at it like the War On Drugs. The people who enforce those laws basically concede that there is nothing they can do about most of the instances in which they are broken. They can make really brutal examples out of the people they do catch, but those are often the most vulnerable individuals, like those who are struggling so badly that they can't effectively disguise their cheating, or in the case of drugs, poor/Black people. There have been sub-clarifications to both, such as the ""tutor-like"" help that instructors turn a blind eye to, or the growing number of states that have legalized weed -- yet the overarching policies do not change and remain somewhat Draconian. So if you get caught with weed in a red state, or get an instructor who happens to be kind of a dick...sure is a different outlook, huh?. . At what point do you acknowledge that your policy is bad?

I think that part of the issue is that, outside of (e.g.) MDEs, most EECS projects and/or homeworks basically involve finding an already-known ""right answer""; if there are key insights that students need to make, then a permissive collaboration policy makes it too easy for students to ""spoil"" them for classmates who aren't as far along, which makes the course less educational for them.. . > A group of 10-12 people got together and worked out the problems to every single homework set we got in 414, everyone participated in the discussion. I retained *so much more* information from 414 than 203, it's not even close.. . This is a very valid point, and I'd expect that's the main reason why EECS 203 (now, apparently, according to commenters on another post) explicitly tells its students that ""anything short of pictures of your answers"" is okay.. . On reflection, I actually do think it would help a lot if something akin to this could be incorporated into the 200- and 100-level courses.. . Maybe if EECS 281 would (for instance) let students earn (a limited fixed percentage of) extra credit on their projects by solving daily LeetCode problems or similar, with any level of collaboration permitted between students, even literal copy-pasting? I've only been thinking about this for a few minutes and would have to spend time thinking over grading implications and logistics and whatever, but that might actually be really, really good practice for collaboratively solving novel problems, and might give students a lot of useful practice for exams.. . > You see, they couldn't confirm the cheating,. . My first thought is that you could have surreptitiously photographed the cheaters with your phone and given that to the course staff. Having your phone out _just_ to do that wouldn't be an Honor Code violation, I think, unless the exam instructions literally said ""all electronic devices must be powered off and put away"", and even then the instructors almost certainly wouldn't prosecute you for it unless they were dumb.. . That's not trying to cast blame on you for not doing that, since (obviously) you'd be focusing on other things while taking an exam. In complete seriousness, it might help if (for instance) the CoE orientation leaders were to start talking about how to proactively report cheating during an exam--both as a deterrent to potential cheaters and to get students used to the idea of asserting themselves and acting independently.",1.0,error,0.0

Wake up in East Quad, lots of noise outside already -- it's the fraternities outside, plus all the traffic coming into town, cars drive slow and people yell out windows cheering at other random people.. . My roommate's already left and left the door open. I slide out of my top bunk and slip into gameday clothes -- I don't really care to close the door, I mean everyone in the quad has already seen me in my boxers from that time I got really drunk at a houseparty on Greenwood and accidently tore my pants off on an East Quad tree stumbling back indoors.. . There's people running up and down the hallways, girls applying temporary Block M tattoos and facepaint, guys running vodka bottles from one room to another. My queer friends at the end of the hall aren't taking shots but have got a really nice wine bottle that they've already managed to finish somehow. How long has everyone else been up?. . The guy who doesn't drink is leaning in his doorframe just watching the chaos with his friend who kind of drinks but not that much. They've got some coffee -- they're actually more into Michigan sports than the rest of us (we all just like to party), and they're going to a family tailgate east of the stadium that they've been to for years as kids.. . The girl who ironically ""hates"" football is yelling ""goo sportsball! Point those goals! Home run!"" and it would typically be annoying but on gamedays it's just part of the experience.. . I grab some food from the cafeteria (frat kids at the table discuss strategies for ""lining a stomach with carbs"" so they can drink more later). Run into my gameday friend crew -- we've never officially said we'll go to every game together but it's sort of happened to work out that way. Today there are a few new faces, friends-of-friends. They introduce themselves as Amy and Ryan. I high-five them and immediately forget their names.. . Together we head to the backyard of Psi Upsilon because they're just down the street. KKG girls are chanting something in the front yard but it blends into the cacophony of street traffic down Hill.. . I play beer pong with some rival kids in the backyard of Psi Upsilon. I throw the first ball so far off-target it bonks someone's chest who wasn't even playing. Some laughs, but the frat guy I know there throws me another ball and tells me to go again. The rival team protests but he says ""hey these are house rules, Michigan fans get one do-over"". . After having a few too many drinks, my squad leaves Psi U and makes the long march down to the Stadium. Along the way we group into a larger and larger mass of people. We're like tributaries of a mighty river, connecting at Hill, State, and eventually Hoover Street where the throng widens into a flood that would rival the Nile Delta. People are yelling and chanting ""Go Blue! Beat X"" and ""It's great, to be, a Michigan Wolverine!"".. . Little shacks on the side of the street sell t-shirts and other maize goods -- ""Ohio is a State that Sucks"" is a $20 best seller. A guy with drums near the IM Building asks people for their names, then freestyle raps songs about them using his drums. As we cross the railroad tracks, the more fancy shacks have couches and TV sets. Radios blare out the broadcast announcers saying ""It's a beeaauutiful day in Ann Arbor, Meechigan! We're 5 minutes to kickoff and the band is taking the field!"". . The uphill hill to the stadium on Greene St always impedes a couple people who are too drunk to keep walking, but my group troops onward. A kid in front of has has a giant Block M flag he's wearing like a cape.. . The man checks my ticket and student ID at the gate. Is that Mike Babcock next to me? It is! No time to accost a local celeb though, my group is already heading up into the student section. As my soul passes through the gateway, I see the bright blue sky, the violently yellow sun, and then my vision descends onto the 100,000+ crowd in front of me. The gladiatorial yells rise in a primal way towards the heavens as the team runs out and touches the M Banner. The population of Ann Arbor within this stadium is more than the population outside it. We push into a section of the stands and someone bats a beach ball that just landed in front of us. The game's begun.",47.0,error,0.0

If you are a student, your schedule is much more flexible than for most people, and you can do your part to minimize the crowds at the polls on election day. While Michigan does not have an official early in-person voting system, you can still do the following:. . * I am assuming you haven't had the opportunity to request an absentee ballot by mail, or perhaps even register in Ann Arbor. So, go either to the Clerk's office at the City Hall (on the corner of Ann and Fifth) or to the satellite office at the UM Museum of Art (on the corner of State and South U) with your M-Card. The hours for the latter are 10 am-7pm weekdays through 10/30, and 8am - 4pm on Saturday, 10/31 and Monday, 11/2 (also, Election day, 8 am-8 pm, but we are talking early voting here). There, you can register and immediately ask for an absentee ballot.. * You can take your absentee ballot to your Ann Arbor home/dorm and fill it out there. If you do so, do not mail it -- it will not arrive in time -- but drop it off at a drop box. Here's the map, including one in the UMMA: [https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Elections/Documents/offical\_ballot\_drop\_box\_map%202020.pdf](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Elections/Documents/offical_ballot_drop_box_map%202020.pdf). * If you don't want to make an extra trip, you can fill out your ballot right there and then, and put it in the drop box. If you plan to do that, you should minimize the time you are spending indoors at a public place, so, before you go.... * Prepare: assuming you live somewhere in Ann Arbor, first look up what ward and precinct you are in: [https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Elections/pages/votingdistricts.aspx](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Elections/pages/votingdistricts.aspx). Then, download your sample ballot here: [https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/PublicBallot/](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/PublicBallot/), do the research you need to make your choices, mark up your sample ballot or take notes to bring with you.. * To save time, note that in Michigan you can vote either for a ""straight ticket"" (i.e., select a single party on top of the partisan section of the ballot), or, if you plan to vote for most of the candidates of the same party, but make a few exceptions, a ""split ticket"". Details here: [https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Elections/pages/voting.aspx](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Elections/pages/voting.aspx) Don't forget to go to the non-partisan section of the ballot to vote on proposals and non-partisan candidates (e.g., Michigan supreme court).. * Also, **bring your own pen**: a black or blue ink pen, not a marker (they can bleed through the paper, rendering the ballot unreadable by machines).",22.0,error,0.0

If things start to go south, if I feel like I'm in too deep and just need to lighten the load a little bit, I'll know I can always just drop that one and pick it up again later. I don't remember if I've ever actually dropped it, but for me having that kind of in place helps me feel better.. . *Always* be checking in with yourself to see how you're doing- Personally, I feel like jumping in with only 12 credits runs the risk of putting yourself a little behind (as a transfer student, I did something like that and I've been just feeling like I'm running a bit behind the clock, whether or not that's the case). What I suggest doing instead is taking something like 15 or 16 credits (Depending on where you're at with your degree requirements) and building a contingency plan into your degree schedule for if you feel like it's too much and you need to drop something your first semester here. That way you build in some flexibility, and you can always just drop a class if you've signed up for more work than you can do instead of signing up for potentially less work than you're capable of handling. Obviously, it's up to you and there's already been some great advice from other folks, but that's what's worked for me :). . . . Another thing to know, and since you've already done some university work you might have already picked this up, but adding one more class adds more work than just the number of credits it counts for- Five classes is a bit more work than four, even if the fifth one is only 1 credit. This is a little different over Zoom University, but there's an energy loss in going between classes and keeping track of an extra set of assignments.

I'm truly sorry you've been put in such a tough spot this semester, and I hope things go well from here on out.. . There's just a few other reasons beyond the ones I listed above as to why I don't think enacting this policy is the right thing to do. For starters, even if classes have proven to be more demanding this semester, that should have been apparent by week 4 of the term, at which point students could still freely drop out without a major tuition hit or could swap around their schedule in an effort to lighten the load. Students could have elected to take their courses pass/fail this semester, and I don't understand why after neglecting to do so, some individuals are insisting that everyone have that forced on them (yes, I understand the ""opt out"" option, but having the default mandatory pass/fail listed as the MO for the semester on transcripts is a bad look for everyone - just ask any unbiased advisor).. . Additionally, the argument that we didn't know how the semester was actually going to be taught kind of falls on deaf ears when you expand it just a little. We never know how any semester will be taught. Tons of students transfer here from various colleges and have an incredibly difficult time acclimating to the new academic environment their first semester. Should they be given a pass/fail ""bailout"" 2 months into that semester? What about students coming in freshman year after attending unchallenging high schools? What about for students taking STATS after hearing how ""easy"" it was from their friends who took it over the Summer, only to later realize that it's generally more difficult in the Fall? Cross campus transfers who understandably had no idea just how demanding engineering or information courses would be?. . Part of why I say all this is that next semester is *not* going to be any easier. If the experts' predictions are accurate, and we don't have a widely available vaccine until this time next year at the earliest, then you can expect the same academics-wise next Fall too. So setting the precedent right now that a school-wide pass/fail system is the right call means that the university is then obligated to enact that policy for likely another whole academic year. And this really sucks to say, but students with 4 semesters of pass/fail credit are *not* going to medical school, law school, or doctoral programs, and will likely be scrutinized even in the professional world.",2.0,error,0.0

Not to sound patronizing, but first make sure that your underlying goal is _actually_ to stay healthy, rather than quieting an inner anxiety that if you gain too much weight you'll be unattractive or a bad person somehow.. . Starting college frequently acts as a sharp shock to somebody's eating and exercise habits, which is why the idea of the Freshman 15 even exists. (I lost weight in my freshman year; sleep-deprivedly powerwalking all over and between North and Central Campus in cold weather before discovering the need to wear layers and eating all of my day's food at once in a single eveningtime binge made me run a substantial calorie deficit.) This isn't really a good thing, but it's not necessarily unusual or unexpected.. . (Also consider that, in addition to battling the Freshman 15, you are _also_ battling The Covid Nineteen just like I'm battling alcoholism. There are many, many reasons to be stress eating right now.). . I could write a much longer post about this, but my thinking is that when trying to stay fit, you should focus on building habits that are self-reinforcing and easy to maintain. IMO, a good way to do that is to focus on building muscle rather than losing weight.. . Having good muscle tone is actually a really big part of being attractive. (Genuinely not meaning this in a creepy way, but this is part of why dancers tend to be extremely attractive: dancing is actually [_really_ physically strenuous](https://youtu.be/pGBbvAGnTxA), and it takes lots of fast-twitch muscle strength to be able to dance ""smoothly."") Speaking seriously, just regularly following an exercise routine roughly cribbed from the ""recommended routine"" on /r/bodyweightfitness (planks, squats, lunges, push-ups, diamond push-ups, etc.; which might take ~an hour a day, three-ish days a week) and eating reasonably until you feel satisfied (diet includes protein) should give any person a noticeably more attractive physique in maybe a month or two.. . It also just literally feels good. Doing the above (during an impromptu gap semester after I did a term withdrawal) hugely boosted my energy levels, mood, and personal interest in physical mating and courtship. And, because you'd be doing a variety of exercises in short bursts (~10 push-ups till exhaustion, rather than jogging for half an hour), it doesn't bore your soul.. . (Realistically, if you were to do this, you should also be doing cardio on your ""off-days"". IMO that's best done with a rowing machine / ergometer, since that exercises a wider range of muscles, actually acts as a sort of strength training by itself, and isn't excruciatingly dull like running on a treadmill. The gyms should all have these; there's also really cheap fold-up ones on Amazon for sub-$300 that actually also work just fine for this purpose.). . And moreover, once you do build muscle mass, you substantially increase your basal metabolic rate (i.e. your body tissues' caloric ""maintenance cost""), which means that you burn ~hundreds more calories per day just by existing. That lets you eat more without gaining fat, since the calories are going to the maintenance of your huge gains.. . It's also (surprisingly) not as ephemeral as I'd first expected. Once you start building muscle, your body seems to hold that ""shape"" to some degree, even if you haven't actually worked out in months and you actually have the underlying muscle tone of Kobe beef.. . tl;dr become Shredded, even if you're a girl. . it's actually super rewarding, the process itself is actually fun, you come out the other side (1) physically healthier, regardless of your body-fat percentage (2) less likely to hurt your back by lifting heavy things dumbly (seriously do squats) (3) able to metabolize more food just by occupying space, and (4) will probably be genuinely more happy with your physical appearance, which (by itself) is already kind of meant to be an indicator of your physical health.. . but make sure to get a spotter, or do your research before doing exercises; i figured out that I've been doing push-ups wrong for my entire life a few months ago, and having bad form can actually injure you",17.0,error,0.0

You're learning what you like. Does it relate to stress- maybe - so what are other ways you can manage stress? Do not let weight gain be a source of stress though. Are you eating more convenience foods because your time is being consumed otherwise? - consider meal or batch prepping. Is it maybe less activity - possibly - consider exercise and activity that you enjoy. Not as punishment!

In my personal experience it's an easy way to empower eating disorders and threaten your personal health and safety (regardless of gender).. . Gaining weight does not mean you're unhealthy. As others have said before, your body needs to support you through a really difficult time rn and if that means you gain weight, that's ok. If you do want to change something, i would say make sure the foods you're eating are nourishing rather than just filling. That doesn't mean to cut out any food!!, but rather to eat more of a well rounded selection.. . Someone also said to ""get shredded"" which like if you can, absolutely go for it lol. When i lived on campus last year i would go on really long walks through the residential areas of Ann Arbor and that seemed to work for me. There are a ton of workout routines available online for free that can be fun. Just make sure you enjoy whatever exercise you're doing so you can stick to it and your body doesn't think it's a punishment.. . Overall, make sure you take care of yourself and appreciate all your body does for you. Make staying healthy something to celebrate and have fun with rather than a punishment. That in my experience has made the most difference.",4.0,neutral,0.4771329462528229
t1_galmme7,2020-10-30 14:01:49,t3_jkrx2u,t3_jkrx2u,"Edit: in terms of losing weight, caloric deficiency will always beat exercise. If you want a better physique you'll need good eating habits, resistance training and cardio.. . To add, it's not always how much you're eating its also what you're eating. Simple substitutions, removals and additions can help you tremendously. Weight control is essentially [calories in - calories out] if it's positive you gain, if it's negative you lose. If you aren't fit you have beginner gains where you can lose weight and build muscle quickly at the same time but for now lets look at simple things to mitigate weight gain.. . This is not promote compulsive eating habits, but i will use numbers because they are more palpable. Eating till you're full is great advice, but you'll see later not all foods are made the same.. . If you want to eat a lot, but don't want the calories, eat a lot high volume/ low calories foods. There usually consist of minimally processed (frozen are fine) fruits, veggies, and chicken or fish. For example a serving of strawberries is 150 grams and 50 calories compared to a serving of dorritos is 28 grams and 150 calories. That means you can eat 3x the amount of strawberries to reach the same calories. The other advantage is you don't need a scale for this approach because you can eat till you're full (i have a scale to make sure my protein intake is good). . Another tip i use is to eat everything not drink it. Juicing while great to get all your nutrients in because it condenses large masses into small volumes however thats the exact issue for weight maintenance. Your stomach is finite container and if you eat your food you'll be full more quickly. If you drink your meals you're more likely to over consume because fluids fill your stomach at slower rate than food. . . Third tip, watch what you're eating with accessory foods i.e. sauces dressings etc... often the serving size is a teaspoon or a tablespoon but people often lather their plate with accessory foods which can often be 2-5 servings. Ranch for instance is 130 calories per serving (2 table spoons). I'm not saying stop eating these foods, but eating less of it and substituting for something else can be helpful.. . By now it might seem overly restrictive but there is silver lining...the last tip is make your own food. When i want pizza, i make my own pizza choosing my ingredients from the store. What i get is, a healthier pizza which has more protein and veggies and less calories than store bought pizza. . . Being healthy doesn't mean be boring, just choose the right foods for your goals. . . For the next section exercise and cardio.. . If you have money to blow, just buy an adjustable dumbell set (50-100lbs). You'll have all the weight you need to do all the exercises you'll want to do for the first year. Buy a fitness tracker to track your steps and get a weight vest for cardio (more weight moved = more calories burned). . If you have 100 to blow, I'd recommend buy a pull up bar and materials to make a sandbag. Sand bags are a great way to add weight or resistance to a workout.. . . If you have zero dollars to blow, the best way to do body weight workouts and get creative. You don't need a pull up bar, you can use a tree branch if outside or a flight of stairs if you in an apt.. . Theres a lot of body weight routines online so I'll leave the exact program to you. Just remember, go slow, and be mindful of form. Great form will outdo ""high"" weights. . . Also lift every other day. As a beginner you need rest days.. . In terms of cardio. All you need to do is walk. Walk for 5-10 mins every hr. It may not seem much but it breaks up the monotony and if you're up for 12 hrs, you'll have walked for 60-120 mins. It adds up.. . If you have more time or want to do a block. You can run, dance, anything really. Just something to consistently raise your heart rate. Some people think you should do cardio on your rest days. I say do it everyday. Cardio for weightloss should be challenging enough you can't comfortably talk but not dying. So it's not as taxing. . . If you are doing sprints etc... and all your cardio makes you gasp for air, you are training for athletic performance not weight loss. Nothing wrong with that, but it's harder on the body so you'll need more rest.. . . Tldr: eat more fruits and veggies and move more",7.0,error,0.0

The school is rooted in a lot of different areas and is very well rounded. Design theory, urban issues, history, and research are all well represented. Being near Detroit fuels a lot of the schools interest in urban/social issues. There's also an abundance of opportunities for undergrads to get into research and fabrication if interested. Because the school is a research institution with a massive library and alumni base, the resources are vast.. . The undergraduate program has a great amount of freedom in how students go about design and in shaping their own work, while having faculty to advise them every step of the way. The program culminates in the Wallenberg Studio which is a great design studio involving travel that is typically on par with graduate level work, and has the possibility of awards/publication. No other architecture school has anything quite like it. That's a huge incentive for people to apply there. . . I'm not sure what gives you the impression of Taubman as a small school. They pull in quite a few impression lectures and faculty every year. The lecture series they put on is quite amazing and professors come from all over the globe. . .

It hasn't been my experience that there are any practical differences at all between a BS from CS-LSA and a BSE from CSE.

I'd be very, very careful about this; I'm not drawing on statistics when I say this, but I'm pretty sure that this mindset causes a lot of students to sign up for unmanageably difficult course schedules that drive them to nervous breakdowns and/or hospitalization.. . ""Giving yourself a challenge,"" in high school, usually means taking all of the AP courses and signing up for a bunch of extracurriculars. Many/Most students at Michigan come from that same background, which makes it _average,_ rather than exceptional. Hard engineering classes are considered hard among _that_ population, which (probably) makes them harder than any other classes you've taken in your life so far.. .

If you do plan on applying to School of Information later on while you're a sophomore here at U of M, then there will be some advantages for your application process. If you don't end up applying to SI, then there's no harm for having checked the box. In other words, you might as well check the box. You can learn more about SI during your first semester here; the school will offer info sessions about what the school is about, the curriculum, the pre-reqs, how to apply, etc. The links on this website can also be helpful: [https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information).. . If you want to do Computer Science, then you'll have to do it through the school of Literature, Science, and the Arts or through the school of Engineering. School of Information does not offer CS, but offers two different pathways: User Experience Research/Design and Informational Analysis. There are interesting coding classes through SI, but SI is ultimately not CS-focused.. . If you are really interested in both CS and one of the School of Information pathways, it is possible to do a dual degree, though you'll probably have to speak with an advisor to see if this would be possible to achieve in your desired timeframe.. . By the way, both Comp. Sci. (either through LSA or Eng.) and the pathways through School of Information have a lot of the same pre-reqs, such as Intro to Stats (STATS 250, or equivalent), a first year-writing class (commonly ENG 124 or 125, but could be something else; only for LSA and SI though, not needed for Eng.), and some first-year coding class (EECS 183, ENGR 101, or SI 106). In other words, you can take some of these courses your first or second semester here and be totally fine not knowing what major and school you want to do yet. Here is a link of the specific requirements for SI: [https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/how-do-i-apply/cross-campus-transfer](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/how-do-i-apply/cross-campus-transfer). The SI 110 class is considered a social science course, so you could take it and it would benefit you regardless of if you plan to do SI or be in LSA. I'm not sure if it will help you if you're in school of engineering though. I would advise doing EECS 183 (LSA) or ENGR 101 (Engr.) for your coding class your first semester. SI 106 is like the school of information's equivalent first year coding course, but EECS 183 will be accepted for both LSA CS and SI whereas SI 106 will only be accepted for SI, so EECS 183 is more versatile that way (same goes for ENGR 101, I believe, if you're in Engr.). If you do ultimately decide to do SI, then you'll likely have time to do SI 106 as well if you want to as you learn a different language in that one than the other ones, though it's not necessary to do both EECS 183/ENGR 101 and SI 106 (I did EECS 183 and SI 106 and enjoyed them both though; doing SI 106 may also help you look better on your SI application).. . This is a lot of information; I hope I did not overwhelm you. If you do get accepted here, I would recommend talking to your advisor about LSA/ENGR/SI to see which will be the best for you and what a good plan to get there is.. . **tl;dr:** just check the preferred admissions box on your Common Application now and you can decide if you want to actually apply to SI or not when you're a sophomore here at U of M.",4.0,error,0.0

t1_gavde7c,2020-11-02 05:32:32,t3_jmfg59,t3_jmfg59,"I tried to give a brief explanation to hopefully help you understand torque a bit more: . . Newton's second law tells us that unbalanced forces on an object cause the velocity of the object to change. This change of velocity is called the acceleration. Linear forces push objects along a line. This line could be side to side (horizontal), up and down (vertical), in and out (toward you/ away from you), or some combination of the three (ex. you could imagine pushing an object up and away from you along a diagonal line).. . Torque is the rotational analog to linear forces. Instead of acting along a line, torque twists around an axis. . . To get some intuition for this, imagine you are trying to move a screw in a wall using a wrench. Start with the wrench parallel to the ground. If you lift the end of the wrench up, the screw will twist counterclockwise. If you push the end of the wrench down, the screw will twist clockwise. If you push the end of the wrench toward the screw (or pull the wrench away from the screw), then the screw will not twist at all.. . Those were the extreme cases. Now, imagine that instead of starting with the wrench parallel to the floor, you start with it at an angle. If you push down of the wrench now, the screw will move clockwise, but not as much as it did when you started with the wrench parallel to the floor. Similarly, if you pull up on the end of the wrench, the screw will twist counterclockwise, but less so than it did when you started with the wrench parallel to the floor. Finally, if you try to push the wrench toward the screw, you will again find that it does not twist at all. . . Based on this information, we can conclude that that the screw twists the most (in either direction) when the apply a force that is perpendicular to the wrench. If the force is not perpendicular to the wrench (but not quite parallel either), then the screw will still twist, though not as much as when we applied a perpendicular force. If the force is parallel to the wrench, then we get no twisting at all. . . Now let's make this more concrete. I suggest getting out a piece of paper and drawing the following:. . 1. A dot representing the screw. 2. An arrow extending from the dot representing the wrench. Label this arrow ""r"", where ""r"" is the length of our wrench. 3. A second arrow at the end of the first arrow representing the force being applied to the end of the wrench. Label this arrow ""F"". 4. Label the angle between ""r"" and ""F"".. . Now we said that when ""F"" is perpendicular to ""r"", the screw twists the most. This corresponds to when the angle between F and r is 90 degrees. When F is parallel to r, the screw doesn't twist at all. This is when the angle is 0 degrees. When the angle is somewhere between 0 and 90, the screw twists a little bit. Think about all of these various scenarios and try to sketch out all of the different directions that the screw can turn. This should help develop your intuition.. . After you feel like you have a good feel for what's happening, you can move on to the more rigorous definitions. Torque is defined to be the cross product of the force F (a vector) and the the ""lever arm"" r, which is the vector from the point of rotation (the ""screw"") to the point where the force is applied (the end of the ""wrench""). Torque is a vector. The magnitude of the torque is defined to be . . F r sin(theta). . where theta is the angle between F and r. The direction of the torque is the direction that the screw moves. If the screw twists counterclockwise, it will move into the wall (""righty-tighty""), so the torque will point inward. If the screw twists clockwise, it will move out of the wall (""lefty-loosey""), so the torque will point outward. Note that the torque is always perpendicular to BOTH F and r.. . A lot of times, you will be asked to consider situations where objects are in equilibrium. All this means is that the net force AND the net torque on the object are both equal to zero-- in other words, the object is neither accelerating along a line nor twisting in any direction. . . I hope this helps a bit. Remember, your imagination is your best friend in physics.",59.0,error,0.0

Honestly it is hard to say your chances of getting a scholarship since the school is so large and there are so many smart people. I have an engineering honors scholarship, and I had a 3.9 gpa and 35 ACT in high school (similar to you), but so do a lot of other people with many also having 4.0's and a full score on the SAT.. . That being said the real thing that differentiates those who get the scholarship would probably be your extra curriculars, leadership opportunities, and essays. I feel a pretty good example that sets the bar for something they would take note of is being an eagle scout, which takes several years of leadership experience and a capstone project that can involve raising thousands of dollars. . . My advice is that since you applied, just pray for you to have passed some arbitrary bar with your qualifications, but don't get your hopes up with getting the scholarship unless your qualifications are stacked. Also keep in mind that Michigan is absurdly exspensive out of state, and even with a $20k honors scholarship you are looking to be paying $40-50k a year and rising. One thing you can do now, which a lot of people dont even know about, is that there are a lot of random scholarships floating around so maybe apply to those (ones tied to the uni, to your state, church, random orgs, etc.).. . Lastly while Michigan does offer a great education in engineering, depending on your major and state you live in, you can likely get a similar level of education for much cheaper (apply to a slightly less competitive school and get a scholarship, attend a good in state school, etc.). So right now just keep on applying to other schools you feel you'll be competitive in, maybe find third party means to acquire scholarships, and keep your grades and morale high.

In my interactions though, i find them more of a thorn at my side at worst and helpful at best. Starting with the worst incidents first, aapd and umpd are sticklers for the letter of the law. One time i got a ticket because my car plates had expired registration tags. My registration was current, the tags just didn't come in yet. This one was trying to intimidate me (took my license and registration cards and analyzed them for 20 mins). The system is electronic and quick and i had no record on it so i know he was trying to dig. . . Another time i was stopped and was in holding because i matched a description supposedly. Questioning was extremely annoying because one officer thought i was withholding information because i was ""too calm"" and ""suspicious"" because I wasn't oversharing information. . . I say thorn on my side because the posturing I've received was just that - posturing. Being from LA and being profiled by LAPD I have seen true intent when an officer wants to harm or really intimidate someone. Aapd doesn't have the same type of teeth. That said, my experiences probably would have scarred someone without my experiences.. . On the positive end, when my car was stolen the officer who took my report was helpful. Even called me back a few weeks later to tell me my car was stripped in detroit, and offered a few dealerships i could look at to replace my car. That was touching.

In many cases we're struggling not only with handling our own terrible situations, but also with trying to be a support system for those we care about. It's physically and emotionally exhausting. On top of it, it can be difficult to even truly feel our own emotions because we feel guilty in the knowledge that everyone else is having just about as shitty a time as we are.. . I think for many of us, the virus has affected us in ways we never anticipated and both scared us with our absolute powerlessness to control even the most basic aspects of our lives, as well as removing the parts of our lives that we would normally count on to get us through a tough time. Many people have lost family members or friends to the virus, and even more people have lost touch with friends or broken up with significant others due to quarantine. It's hard, and it's okay to feel anxious, depressed, or hopeless. It's okay to be broken.. . I also understand that for many of us, tonight was supposed to be a sign of hope, a light at the end of the tunnel. We looked for a change, a way to find a solution to this pandemic that has upended our lives, and it looks as though we may not get it. I understand the fear. All of us know there's now no end in sight to this pandemic. Many people are either afraid their freedoms will be stripped from them, and many of us are afraid for those we love and care about. I know it feels like we just got kicked while we were down, sucker punched one more time. I know this feels like the straw that broke the camel's back.. . I can't promise things will get better soon, or say that this isn't a serious blow. What I can say to anyone who needs to hear it is this: You are stronger than you think. You can do it. Take the time to hug a friend, call your parents, validate a friend's concerns. We're looking at a long road wrought with broken hearts and unfortunate change. But when we do get out of this, we will be stronger than ever. It's not about forcing happiness, it's about not letting sadness win.
