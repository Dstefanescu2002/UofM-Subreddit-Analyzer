A minor is a fundamentally useless as a credential so any worth you can derive from doing one has to come from you getting actual value out of the courses you select. My info-dump about my experiences with the courses you've listed that I've also taken:. . * 334 is basically a general social psychology course, but is a personal top pick from that list. I took it with Prof. Krupka and found it to be a lot of reading but honestly looking back that's been one of the courses I've probably ""gotten the most out of"" in terms of life-skills because when you start talking in lecture about the actual takeaways of the readings, you can understand a lot more about why and how people interpret things and act. I'd almost rename it ""Perception and Social Influence."" I work in tech but have gotten a lot of intangible value from that class. * 339 is the most barebones webdev course you'll be able to take and you'll learn HTML, CSS, and how to copy-paste stuff into validators to ensure your sites meet accessibility standards. It probably won't be enough to get you a job in webdev since it barely touches javascript, and when I took it, didn't touch any modern frameworks, but it's a starting point I suppose. Good class, easy class, great prof.. * 364 is generally Dr. Chuck (Severance) having people enroll in 4 credits to basically take a copy-paste of his online coursera-style courses he's known for. Interesting dude, but a lame course and one it felt hard to take away too much from. When I took it, the entire course was pretty much copy-pasting Django python code. * 425 basically felt like 301, mixed bag of thinking about behavioral economics and auctions and similar fuckery, combined with some case studies. Honestly this one was very ""meh"" but it was cool learning about pricing strategies for freemium models and I think if you want to go into a generic business career (consulting) it could be worthwhile. * 429 was groovy and part of the now-dead social-media track within BSI/MSI (which I guess turned into a branch for the minor) and when I took it, the course was about 5 major challenges faced in social media organizations and how they work // are addressed // etc. (things like regulating behavior, onboarding new members, setting norms, fostering engagement, I think those are close). We all also picked an online social-affording platform we would each focus on through the term and our final term paper focused on how all of those topics worked in the context of that platform, how they could be improved, what works, what doesn't, etc.. . Your prompt was to pick 3 from the list, and it really just depends what you see yourself doing or want to explore. I'd say do 334 and then if you want to do UX probably 388+482 since those are courses for the major and would probably help get you some portfolio pieces?",1.0,error,0.0

I'm finding myself at home after a suicide attempt because of the culture and personal circumstances that exist exclusively at umich. I struggled with people doing a lot of ECs and bragging about internships as well as the grind and obsessive pro-umich culture here, but I also struggled being closeted to my sister who was studying here last year because of her homophobic ideas, having to hide from a cult and not being able to call them out because of personally knowing them (and calling them out might lead me to get potentially shunned), people making fun of me at Markley because of how I dress, an honor code situation which one of my friends who I since blocked dragged me into, a friend who was also involved who ghosted me, and another friend who blocked me on social media. I also had a failed relationship and felt little to no sense of community and being in a single after arguments with roommates led to me getting depression on top of the cripplung anxiety, ocd, and ptsd I was Dealing with coming into u of m. . . Im gonna be transferring out next fall. Umich was never viable and my last choice in college admissions to begin with, despite being a Reach, due to personal circumstances that can lead me to damage my relationship with family and get shunned by dozens of people I know in my life, and on top of that, all that happened here. All within my freshman year of college. I was never happy here and I wouldntve been here had I succeeded my suicide plan back in August.. . . For me, I know where I'm going next, as I know it'll provide a safe environment for me for the first time in my life without closeting myself to anyone on campus. But I know if I continue here I will definitely probably try to commit suicide again.. . I'd say, also I have heard a lot of people on this sub having a similar experience, but that they managed to find friends later in their college career. If your family is supportive and you don't have to deal with a lot of personal bullshit that can get you excommunicated by loved ones and you don't know who your home group is, I want to say stick it out because you'll never know, you might later find a group of friends to help you stick it out till the end of your undergrad studies. But if you have circumstances that can literally fuck up your life in an instant being at u of m, then I'd say transfer the fuck out.

But while there is some irony that you're looking to others here you are collecting information which is a very good approach as the best starting point for any decision making. You're doing it! It takes practice. . . Hopefully somewhere along the way you'll learn the advanced skill of being able to both not doubt yourself while doubting yourself. It takes security and confidence to do that. A sign of intellectual maturity is that someone who can freely admit being wrong without being vested in always being right. And related, someone who doesn't need to convince you they're right but instead gives you deep respect and spaciousness and acknowledges your own freedom. A sign of expertise is understanding and owning just how much they don't know about the subject and where their particular scope of knowledge fits. These are some of the hallmarks and differences I have noticed between people who are not well educated and/or intellectually mature, and people who aren't at all.. . It also involves developing your own bullshit detector and recognizing manipulation and motives and why people act the way they do so I would recommend classes in psychology, and sociology. There's a whole body of study into how and why cults work which might be fascinating to you. Noam Chomsky IIRC also did a lot of work with an authoritarian versus permissive paradigm - and he's a *linguist*. A cult from my experience is the epitome of authoritarian extremes where you don't or can't question the mores of the group and leaders, with an all or nothing, in or out approach. . . Also the above recommendations for studying philosophy is spot on - philosophy is the epitome of critical thinking and logic. I actually wish I would've majored in it but foolishly felt it wasn't marketable. It gives an excellent basis for law school and I have a friend who's made a very happy career for himself as a professor. . . I am wondering if joining a debate team and getting some debate skills under your belt might be helpful as well but that would take you in a more concrete direction trying to argue a side and prove something ""right"" rather than the ability to see all sides of it. Although good debate would consider and address the counter arguments. . . These are some of the things that tend to be missing from cult like cultures of which I have direct experience.:-). Congratulations for escaping. It takes a lot of self-confidence and grit and maturing to be able to extract oneself.

I do know another older ish undergrad that lives in Ypsilanti and commutes in. The bus system that the school operates is pretty good but stays close to campus. City busses don't have a great or awful reputation - but I haven't ridden them. You do need a car for going to the grocery, walmart or target - nothing big downtown that's going to have a full selection at reasonable prices. In fact, all of the strip malls are south and east of town (ypsi). . . It's more a matter of what is important to you, time or money. . . You can live outside Ann Arbor, which is a smaller city and commute in. You'd park at a commuter lot and ride the bus in. Iirc my friend pays around 900/mo for her place which is a small 2bd house. About 20 min outside of Ann Arbor and you're in rural southern Michigan. Tons of farms and open space. It's not truly rural, the air is still a bit dirty and a lot of ambient noise/light pollution, but still better than downtown.. . You could live in the city core, where its going to cost at least 2.5-3x as much, but you can walk everywhere except the strip mall stores. Lots of high rises and buildings downtown by the school. Lots of rental houses in meh neighborhoods. High demand and tons of mommy and daddy's money flowing drive prices UP. . . Or you can live in the suburban part of the city which is higher density single family homes, small buildings and a few small high rises. It's where families live within the city. It's bus and bike-able but not really walkable. It's in the middle between ypsi and downtown. Like 1800-2k for a nice ish 2bd. . I live off of north campus, walk 0.5 mi or less into north to catch the busses. I got a 1bd at a steal by moving in out of season. (Eladott and Huron River Flatts are leasing 2 bd apartments for 2k or less rn). . Another thing to remember is that michigan hates drivers. Insurance is going to be 2-3x whatever state you're coming from, taxes/fees are assessed on the value of your vehicle new. I drive a 20yr old Lexus that I built and repaired myself... but I'm paying fees assessed on a 50k price tag... for a vehicle that's worth nearly 10% of that now. Assuming you do all that, then the state is going to salt your ride into a rust bucket. For all the cost and hassle, an e-bike, one wheel or scooter will get you around town nearly as fast for much less hassle. . . One last thing, you're over 30 clearing 100k for your household... why are you paying someone else's mortgage? Might be time to buy. Lots of programs out there for little down and low interest. The usda rural development loan thing program might apply to rural land outside town. I like my space, peace and quiet. . Something like this: . https://www.michigan.gov/mshda/homeownership/homebuyers/mi-home-loan . You all are on the line for a 2 person - no students low/moderate income program from Rural Dev. If either of you are students right now it would work. . . Congrats on the job!",1.0,error,0.0

t1_iyuhd0e,2022-12-04 06:32:10,t3_yx55gd,t3_yx55gd,"TO ALL STUDENTS: Avoid renting an apartment from TREMONT, THE BRYN, or THE POINTE in State College, and any property managed or owned by CARDINAL GROUP COMPANIES, CARDINAL GROUP MANAGEMENT, or GREYSTAR. These are predatory businesses, that target college students. Although GREYSTAR reflects a ""warning"" on their website to avoid any association with properties that prohibit potential Tenants from viewing their apartment before Leasing, that is exactly what GREYSTAR employees do!. . These are slum-properties owned and managed by Slumlords. These properties will lie to potential Tenants and say there is only 2 apts left and they need to put a deposit/sign a lease fast to ensure they have an apt. They'll ask for approximately 3 months rent, or multiple months, in far advance. They are being sued by several people and now, members of Congress are going after them! A mother and son Victims in Illinois are suing them in Federal Court. Case Name: **Rossetti v. Haim Saban et al, Case# 1:21-CV-** **4324.** In that case, the VICTIMS discovered that they'd paid for an apartment that did not exist, on the day the Victim Tenant moved-in. The apt was uninhabitable! There was Black Mold throughout, filthy, black carpets, although the Marketing Managers lie and say that the apt and ALL apts are ""deep steam cleaned"". They make false claims about doing extensive cleaning to avoid COVID-19 exposure, especially if a previous Tenant vacated in a short period of time before the new Tenant(s) moved in. This is also false! These misstatements and misrepresentations are all part of their scheme to defraud. GREYSTAR does the very same thing.. . These predatory businesses will take their time to repair/replace old, non-working appliances. CARDINAL GROUP had ALL non-working appliances at the time the Plaintiff in the Illinois lawsuit moved in, although they claimed that they had ALL updated and up-to-date appliances. Their webpage reflects that as well, but the appliances were 25-27 years old and NOT working. CARDINAL GROUP staff will then tell Tenants, ""Too bad! You signed a Lease! Pay us or we'll send you to collections!"". . They will also delete Tenants MAINTENANCE WORK ORDERS so that there is not a ""paper trail"" and no evidence, in their efforts to further their scheme to defraud. If you've been scammed by CADINAL GROUP MANAGEMENT OR GREYSTAR, or you know of any student or person who has been been defrauded / scammed by these people / predatory businesses, contact your State's Attorney General or a lawyer. CARDINAL GROUP tries to force their victims to sue under Landlord/Tenants laws, to avoid Victims suing their corporations. Beware of Attorneys that don't ""sound right"". It is also important that those who have been scammed by these people, file an online Complaint with the their Attorney General's Office. It takes about 7 minutes to complete!. . **\*\*\*CARDINAL GROUP COMPANIES, CEO ALEX O'BRIEN, and CARDINAL GROUP MANAGEMENT ARE ALSO BEING SUED IN DENVER, COLORADO for the same Racketeering Scheme, Scheme to Defraud!**. . **\*\*\*BEWARE OF ANY PROPERTY OWNED/OPERATED BY CARDINAL GROUP HOLDINGS, LLC, CARDINAL GROUP COMPANIES, CARDINAL GROUP MANAGEMENT, CARDINAL GROUP MANAGEMENT MIDWEST, OR GREYSTAR (HAS SIMILAR LAWSUITS AGAINST THEM).**. . Last, do your research. There are not many Student Housing properties Off-Campus, that have not been recently sued in the past, or have pending lawsuits against them by the Pennsylvania Attorney General, for defrauding and scamming college students!!! A quick ""google search"" or accessing their website, go in the upper-left-hand corner, enter ""State College"" in the Search bar. There, you can see some current cases. You can contact them directly as well. That online Complaint is important! They can't do anything unless they know about it You may also report it to the Federal Trade Commission, and the Dept. of Justice.. .

Dropping a class is when you take a course (usually for credit) and then decide later that you no longer want to be enrolled for whatever reason (don't like the class, too hard, too busy with other classes, w.e). There's a deadline for when you can drop a class without having it show up on your transcript (I don't recall anymore how many weeks it is, check with your advisor). If you drop the class after that deadline it will show up on your transcript, and there's a later deadline after which you cannot drop the class at all.. . In your case it sounds like you want to take this class for credit, but you're not sure if you'll like it. That means that you don't want to audit it (because then if you finish it you'll get no credit), but you do want to retain the option to drop it. If that's your situation then you want to make sure you find out what the deadline is, make sure that you will still have enough credits left to qualify as a full time student if you drop this class, and make sure you can still graduate on time if you need to move that upper level elective to a different semester.

The fact that it was an extreme allegation (criminal sexual conduct of the first degree to a 11 year old) from a woman/child, makes it even more likely to be believed (""how/why would a child lie about something like that""). Peter Chen even said himself in an EECS town hall (before he was charged), in regards to the Mars incident, [""Allegations are not the same as proven facts, and not always found to be true. All people deserve to be processed and presumed innocent until proven guilty, this is a principle learned in government but becomes personal in out own sphere. **The worse the allegations the harder it is to keep these principles in mind**""](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/l77lve/comment/gl5snj7/) . However, once actual information came out, it became pretty clear that accusations were pretty hazy to say the least. The only evidence was the accusation which was a repressed memory testimony, an exceedingly controversial psychiatric eyewitness evidence theory that courts in at least 12 states have found to be inadmissible. This allegation came from the victim writing a letter after a month of intensive therapy (3 years after the alleged incident), in which in the same letter she writes ""I do not know if this is true"". I believe she chooses to go forward with the accusations in a second letter sent later which changed facts about the story.

I would be willing to bet this guy is on the autistic spectrum. It could very well be that he is fascinated by Asian culture and where he grew up there weren't any Asian folks. So now he's overwhelmed by so many females that he views as representing a culture that he's fascinated with. He obviously doesn't have the social skills to properly communicate with people.. . Of course, there could be other reasons that we don't know behind his attraction to asian females. This idea that attraction to a certain group of people is always fetishizing is a bit of a stretch. What if I'm attracted to redheads, very thin or morbidly obese, very tall or very short, extremely intelligent people, polyamorous folks, or whatever it may be. These are attractions that every human being has and to say that's always fetishizing is absolutely wrong.. . People are people and regardless of the pseudo civilized social norms that dictate certain things as good or bad, at our core we are human beings the same needs, want, and desires as humans had millennia ago.. . What you're doing is trying to destroy this person's education opportunities without first talking to the individual and trying to understand their motivations and social limitations. Instead of trying to destroy what he has worked hard to do, obviously getting into the University of Michigan is not easy, take the time to speak with him. As a future journalist, it is extremely important to understand that sometimes people just need a helping hand, they don't need somebody doxing them. Don't try to make headline news at somebody else's expense without knowing what's going on with that individual, before trying to help the individual.. . I'm going to repeat this again and hope that it sinks in. Instead of turning to social media and demonizing somebody, take the time to speak with them. That is the mature adult thing to do. You went from 0 to 100 with your response. You completely failed to do the right thing as a human being. It's apparent that you want this guy kicked out of the university.. . Well, your response to the situation makes me feel uncomfortable that there's somebody on campus that will try to demonize somebody that doesn't fit with their perception of how people should act. I think I would be more comfortable if you were kicked out of the university. How does that make you feel? You don't like it that the shoes on the other foot do you?. . All that said, after communicating with him and offering him some direction as far as learning better communication skills, perhaps you could help him learn more appropriate communication skills, you may learn the source of his poor interpersonal communication skills. It could very well be that both his parents are only autistic spectrum so he didn't have good communication techniques to mirror as a child, leaving him at a loss as to why his communication techniques do not give him the results he desires.. . After working with the guy, it may be that he has issues that are beyond the scope of poor communication skills and autistic spectrum deficits. If that is the case then different solutions have to be looked at. There is also the potential that help from you could put him on the trajectory to be a phenomenally good human being, with both a successful career path and a successful social/relationship path.. .

I'm uncertain about the scholarship related to Stuart's arrival at the cavalry fields. I understand why historians have written that Stuart may have had an error in timing his charge, but I think it's equally likely that he was given the discretion to independently make a charge if he felt that he could loop and encircle the infantry at the battle site itself, and when that opportunity arose he tried to seize it.

I don't think so.. . Yep so in this situation, you described a woman that prefers hairy dudes (""really likes""), she does not **fetishize** hairiness. If she did and she is only dating this man because he is hairy, then she would move on to the next hairy boyfriend. That's the difference. . . Let's say someone has a foot fetish so they follow a girl on Onlyfans who posts feet content. If she stops posting feet content and transition to normal content, they will unfollow. They don't care about the girl, they care about the feet. They'll move on to the next OF girl who posts feet. . . The key difference between preference and fetishism is that with fetishism, you isolate and objectify that particular thing you are fetishizing. If you have a foot fetish like the example above, you don't care who the feet is connected to because it doesn't matter. . . This guy in question fetishizes Asian women and not just simply prefer them. It doesn't matter to him which asian woman it is, just that they are asian. If we lived in a world where you can change your race at will, and his girlfriend decided to no longer be Asian, do you think his behavior suggests that he will stay with her? . . Using your example, it would be a woman who doesn't care about which hairy man it is, so long as they are hairy.. . (Also, this might sound really extreme and unlikely, that's because it is. Genuine fetishism is really extreme and relatively rare, and unsurprisingly makes the subject of that fetishism very uncomfortable. Your identity is essentially ignored and their attention is only concentrated on one area of you, such as a feature or your race.)",1.0,negative,0.6616973876953125

I know all about not being able to handle classes alongside a job, as well as having an abusive family I absolutely could not go back to. I ended up going back to an abusive ex to make sure I didn't end up back home with my parents, which, don't recommend. Fortunately in my case we had enough time apart for me to build up some esteem and we've moved from abusive to only occasionally toxic, but without him I would've been totally screwed. He's had a pretty tough upbringing too in addition to also being autistic and adhd, so I try to cut him some slack. We're learning as we go. Personality and developmental disorders are hard enough to deal with on their own, let alone when you've got financial problems or anything else. Also, he didn't pay for everything, he covered our security deposit and some groceries for a bit but everything else has been halfsies. I took out a personal loan to make sure I could get by for a few months, not even because I couldn't find a job, but because I really REALLY needed at least a month to rest and try to recover from a lifetime of burnout. . . I had big plans to off myself just before graduating this Spring/Summer, but obviously didn't go through with them. It's tough, the bills suck ass, but come Fall pretty much everywhere is hiring at least seasonally due to Christmas. I'm at Target right now and their starting wages are at least 15 an hour, which, again not great for student loans, personal loans, and mountains of credit card debt like my irresponsible crazy ass has, but it's manageable for the time being. Definitely manageable if you budget and/or are frugal. . . I'm only as screwed as I am now because I had it in my head the only time I'd ever be able to have fun and party and be middle-class was on scholarship, so I went all out. Also had that big plan to kill myself at the end, so none of it ever really mattered to me until I decided to actually try to live.. . Also, not for nothing, things will get easier.

I prefer the system where, during lectures, there are occasional practice questions thrown in. helps to keep me awake throughout the entire class when I'm particularly sleepy and to test knowledge that we just learned. . 2. iClicker is cool, but I hate when it's graded. if questions are asked during class, I'd prefer it to be more of a ""how well do you understand this topic right now so I can help you in ideas I may not have talked about enough"" instead of quizzing people soon after learning about it (I personally need some time to marinate over ideas taught, especially for harder concepts). . 3. not sure about this one yet - don't have as much experience. I'm on the fence about it for sure. . 4. exam based grades are both good and bad imo. good, because it's all I have to worry about and not have to take care of doing homework. bad, because it's the only thing testing my knowledge and may not account for particularly bad days/test taking anxiety. tbh, I personally don't mind either way. for earning points back, I love that stuff. I think it helps students engage with the topic more? not sure, but if I can get more points back you bet I'm gonna try it. . 5. not as much experience with this either. since it's an upper level stem class, I feel like this is unavoidable (lol). depending on how upper level the class is, some guidance on understanding the papers (at least in the beginning) might be helpful. discussion though >>>>>> talking about articles definitely helps to break it down more too which helps in understanding. . obviously I think it's great to try things out and see how the class responds, but this is just my opinion so far (most of my experience has been w large intro courses so it's probably a little different with a small class)",56.0,neutral,0.4832635819911957

First of all, almost everyone does pretty bad on the DP problems. The only people that get them perfect are usually the people grinding leetcode since freshman year. All my friends that took 281 before me said that they basically got 1/4th the points for that question. If I were you I would focus on the multiple choice, try to get more than half. Then try to get good at the first written question which will most likely be a hash table, or BST question. Those are fairly doable with enough practice. . . Now to get partial credit on the DP problem, I would highly recommend looking at the time and space complexity. For example if you look at problem #127 Dice Sum on the extra practice. They say that space complexity is O(NM) and the time is O(NMX) and then if you look at the answer you create a 2D vector and do a triple nested for loop! You know it's a 2D vector because of the space, and you know there will be a triple nested loop because of the time. Just from that alone you will probably get some of the points. The last part is the hard part, what goes in the triple for loop? It's basically the same as asking the question how does one square relate to the other in the 2D table. If you have enough time you can try to figure that out, or if you aren't feeling confident it may be more worthwhile to check over all your answers and just take the partial credit.. .

Exam based grades are anxiety inducing, but I've had better experience with those types of classes than with classes that have weekly homework. The ability to earn points back would be a godsend, but that would certainly take away from the anxiety of having the whole grade hinge on one or two exams. If the class is very method/math based (eg. solving for systems or circuits) I think it's best to give weekly homework for practice (and grade it, or I likely won't be doing it). . 5. As an upper level undergrad student, academic papers are hard to decipher. Reading them together and teaching how to read them may help. I had a class where graded work was unexpectedly almost completely based on reading and writing academic papers, and I struggled so hard. Weirdly, the subject matter and homework didn't reflect this at all though, and there were no exams on the homework material. Because of this, everyone just cheated through the homework, didn't learn the material, and left the class with some type of PTSD regarding academic papers.",2.0,positive,0.7971722483634949

Bring resumes, research the companies attending and narrow your list, generate questions. When you get to the booth, you'll likely be prompted to give an elevator speech and then the recruiter may ask about your experiences and interests. Make sure to have some questions ready, as this will show your interest and help your decision making. You should be evaluating the company just as much as they're evaluating you. As the exchange concludes, expect the company to keep your resume as a way to remember and contact you. You may ask for the recruiter contact info or card, but I usually direct to candidates to add me on LinkedIn. . In my experience, we then schedule in person interviews over the next couple days on campus.

I'm a FTVM major (Film, Television and Media) and there's a few places you can go to be an actor on some of the student led productions on campus.

All of those are really good options if you're looking for something more professional!. . If you'd like something a little more chaotic that would help us out in the major, at the start of each term there will be a bunch of casting calls put out for various classes that have in and out of class productions. I just finished FTVM 300, in which 4 student led films were made, each of them needing actors. FTVM 423 typically needs actors, but I believe main characters are already cast. There's also FTVM 290, which is more basic production, and they occasionally need actors and extras. There's also a few other production courses, such as 304, 306, 302, and others I can't recall off the top of my head that will need actors and extras for next semester. . . If you're not interested in either joining a film sponsored by FTVM or a student organization, there's also many student projects that people make in their own time. If you'd like to learn more about them, you can ask to be put on the mailing list at the FTVM offices on the 6th floor of North Quad. . .

t1_izomuf1,2022-12-10 18:02:00,t3_zh21xw,t3_zh21xw,"1. I have only ever had one class where I thought the flipped classroom style actually worked. The class was scheduled to be 2 hour blocks twice a week, but the professor would post short videos on the content, typically broken up into 15-30 minute segments based on topic and would assign no more than an hour's worth of videos at a time, and then let us out of class an hour early because we had already done an hour's worth of lecture work outside of class time. During class time, he had well-crafted practice problems that he would hand out, allow students time to work and discuss with one another, and then walk through the problems in depth as a class. . . I think some key points here: if you're going to flip your classroom, be very aware of how much time you're taking from students. Also, breaking up long videos by topic into shorter segments makes them less daunting, as I felt more inclined to start watching 1 of 2 or 3 15 minute videos at a time than one 45 minute one. This also, in my opinion, only worked because it was an extremely math-heavy class, where working with others on practice problems is equally as, if not more, important as learning the material. I've never liked flipped classrooms where it was mostly content that was concept/memorization based.. . 2. If you're doing the free app-based version, sure! As long as you don't grade it based on accuracy because that can be anxiety-inducing, especially if the content was recently taught and students haven't had time to process. I had a professor grade them based on participation, but you only had to do 80% of them across the semester to get full participation points, to take the stress away from having to miss a class or two for any reason. They were also typically 1-2 review questions from the previous lecture that tied in to the new content for that day. He would also occasionally use it as an opportunity for student feedback, asking questions like ""is the homework/exam too easy/hard/long."". . 3. Hate them. No one ever uses them, and when they're assigned, it's just more of a headache because people don't actually care about engaging in meaningful discussion but rather just about their grade. Having Piazza as an optional option is better, as it gives students a place to ask questions to both instructors and other students, and it's usually very helpful to see other people's questions there too.. . 4. Exam based grades are incredibly anxiety inducing, especially since it's easy to just be having a bad day or to not be a good test taker. A class that I'm taking right now has two exams and instead of a final, we have a final project that's worth a bit more than an exam. We also have weekly graded homework assignments that, when added together, are worth roughly the same as the project. I think a system similar to this gives a lot more leeway in the event that a student doesn't do well on one exam or assignment so that it doesn't tank their grade. Ability to earn points back also takes away a lot of that stress so that students can focus more on actually learning the content than on just passing the class.. . 5. It's fine when used sparingly. Please don't use Perusall. If you're unfamiliar, Perusall is a platform where instructors upload a research article and students are required to annotate it. However, Perusall autogrades the annotations and doesn't inform you how you're doing or what you're grades on, so students end up spending more time scouring the paper to find something to comment on rather than actually reading and understanding. I think that discussion is extremely valuable, but not when it's forced in an online forum-type setting. I much prefer settings where you read the paper and come into class and discuss specific points with the people around you and then maybe share some interesting facts with the class afterwards. Again, it's better when used sparingly, because oftentimes, the paper being read doesn't tie in directly to the content being learned/tested on and is just something extra on top of the homework and studying that needs to be done. . . A method that one of my professors used for discussion was that he built in what he called ""case studies"" into the lectures, where he would describe a more real life situation or application of the subject matter, and after each lecture, he would come back to it and we would discuss, both with the people around us and the whole class after, how the content we just learned tied into the case study. He used the same one every 3 or so lectures so that each lecture built on each other and our understanding of the case study. I thought it was a great way to promote discussion and increase comprehension of material.. . . Good luck with your class! The fact that you're asking about things like this in advance makes me feel like you're going to do a great job. The best professors I've had have always emphasized that they were open to feedback and gave students the space to share how they felt about the lecture style, homeworks, exams, and anything else and found ways to incorporate that.",2.0,error,0.0

Meet up with a counselor or CAPS. Try to locate where the problem is: indecisiveness? Stress? Just not being a good test-taker? Mental health? Pressure from the outside world?

I'm not saying it's the only way, but if you can do it (especially after putting so much effort already) I'd try to finish it. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Maybe if your major is hard then switch to something similar so you have some courses overlap but slightly easier. Take easier classes, look carefully at the previous syllabi and what kind of assignments and examinations are required (if you are bad at essays don't take a class that is essay-based, if you are not a good test-taker then choose a class with less tests or open-book exams).

Having said that, if you're certain you can't do it or if your mental health is really struggling in college, then drop out.

Remember that you are given multiple opportunities to take these mastery assessments, so you have the opportunity to practice, learn, and grow.. . The Function Concepts Mastery is worth 8% of your course grade. To earn the full 8%, you must correctly answer all 7 questions on a proctored mastery. If instead you correctly answer 6 out of 7 questions, you will earn 6%, but can continue to retake the assessment for a higher score. If you correctly answer only 5 or fewer out of 7, you are not yet earning any credit, so you should review past tests, identify material you should work on, use your instructor and the Math Lab for help, and try again."". .

Different instructors have different approaches to incentivizing larger participation, anything from giving extra credit if a student forwards the receipt received after they submit, or giving every student some credit if more than a certain % of students submit.

The Tang Dynasty and the Eastern Roman Empire were two of the most powerful and influential empires in the world in the mid-to-late 7th century. Both empires were known for their elaborate and sophisticated systems of government, which included extensive bureaucracies and a complex system of customs and trade. In this essay, we will compare and contrast the imperial customs apparatus of the two empires, examining how they were organized, how they were used to regulate trade and commerce, and how they contributed to the overall strength and stability of the empires.
.
. One of the key similarities between the customs apparatus of the Tang Dynasty and the Eastern Roman Empire was their focus on regulating trade and commerce. Both empires were located at the crossroads of major trade routes, and both were heavily dependent on trade for their economic success. To facilitate this trade, both empires established elaborate customs systems that were used to collect taxes and duties on imported and exported goods. These customs systems were also used to enforce trade agreements and regulations, and to prevent the smuggling of contraband and illegal goods.
.
. In the Tang Dynasty, the customs apparatus was known as the ""Supervision of Merchandise"" (shang-lu), and it was one of the six major departments of the central government. The Supervision of Merchandise was responsible for collecting taxes and duties on imported and exported goods, as well as enforcing trade regulations. This department was organized into a hierarchy of officials, with the chief of the department at the top and a network of regional and local officials responsible for implementing the policies and regulations of the department.. . updoots to the left",88.0,neutral,0.8606134653091431

Can you study with one of your classmates and go over themes that are particularly troubling you?

I would just like these videos to verbally explain how the project is expected to work, for example, a project 5 video could explain state something like . . ""The goal of this project is for you to create multiple mapreduce jobs to eventually lead to this kind of output, and you should probably have each job dedicated to do some small specific thing. The maps should probably not do much other than input/output handling and the reducers should be the part of the job that does a lot. The way you pass information works through stdout/print statements, so printing from map leads it to reduce, and reduce leads it to the next map job. The key portion of each reducer job tells Madoop how many partitions to create..."". . Information like this in a centralized video would be so helpful and wouldn't even really give anything away, because these are *expectations*, not design choices or project giveaways. I'm sure this is told to us somewhere in lab slides or in the spec, but for it to be in a centralized place like a video and clearly laid out for us verbally would be so helpful and I'm sure that would save some office hours queue times too.. .

Said this in another comment, but EECS 281 videos, I will agree, were super super super informational and helpful. EECS 485 could have videos that are more like explanations of the spec rather than 'you should use a queue here' like 281 videos were. It would help if they described some expectations and how the project was supposed to work at the end, they don't have to tell us design choices and data structures like 281 videos did. . 3. The same thing can be said for every class. I'm saying that short videos explaining the project could only go to help us without removing important aspects of the course like self-learning.

The projects require very little knowledge from lectures which is an issue. Also the lectures are very high level (which is to be expected, it's a broad field) and due to this the lectures don't feel as important. This leads to the exams just being a bunch of multiple choice questions built to trick you. I think 485 should emphasize system design more. Keep the projects as is, but replace some multiple choice questions with some short answer design FRQs on the exam and throw in lab exercises that target system design and the class. This will be far more useful. Technologies like React and Flask change over time, design principles/considerations do not. Give us practice on how to design.

Your on the job experience very quickly becomes everything.. . If you want to look attractive to one of these companies you generally want to show that you're no longer totally green. I would suggest sticking at wherever you are for at least a couple years, ideally long enough to get some nominal promotion (Software Engineer I -> II for example) that gives you a bit of a growth story on your resume. If you do have to move you really wanna avoid switching in under a year, especially if you have to do it multiple times.. . When you think it's time to start interviewing, brush up on the leetcode and also start compiling some work projects that you can talk about your role in. The technical questions are not fundamentally gonna be any different from what you get for entry level roles (but you will probably need to brush up on them), however the other interviews are probably going to want to hear about how you solved technical and product problems _as part of a team_. The biggest thing you're gonna add in those first couple years out of college isn't necessarily technical skill (you'll learn a lot, but they can teach you tech). Managing projects in a professional 9-5 environment with other engineers, project management, customers, etc. is a lot different from banging out your 281 projects in your dorm room, and FAANG (as well as everybody else) is gonna want to see that you can work well in that kind of environment without constant butting heads or leaving your team hanging.. . Side projects/competitions/hackathons are pretty overrated in my experience. It can be a nice thing to have in your back pocket in case you want to speak extemporaneously about some tech that you're interested in, but you should really think of it as like a cherry on top of an already solid well rounded resume. FAANG are big companies, and so they want to see that you do work well in a _professional_ environment first and foremost.. . Also if I could give a piece of advice it would be to avoid focusing too tightly on just FAANG. It's true that they are well known for having good comp and benefits and a cool work environment, but they are far from the only companies that offer that. If you end up doing a stint at one of them it can certainly open up opportunities for you down the line, but do yourself a favor and see what else is out there as well once you decide it's time to move on from your first (or second, or third) job. There are a lot of ""boring"" companies that are competing for the same pool of talented engineers that FAANG is and they're willing to pay like it too. And that's not even mentioning startups and smaller companies that are gonna offer an entirely different kind of workplace that some people find they much prefer to a massive corporation (FAANG or otherwise). All this to say, FAANG is not the be all end all of success in the industry, so shop around and see what's right for _you_.. . EDIT: Forgot to mention how to actually make initial contact. Recruiters are around all the time both at live events (conferences mostly) and online on linkedin and such. Take the time to chat with them when you get the chance, and if you're not looking at the moment just keep track of their info for later. When you're ready to start looking in earnest, reach out to those folks and ask about what roles they have available. They generally appreciate referrals as well if you're trying to keep up a good relationship with them.",6.0,error,0.0

Look at EECS 370, 203, and EECS 376 (traditionally in person exams, at least they were last semester). The exam averages for those classes are in the mid 60's usually, sometimes even below that. Those classes are conceptually difficult but their average exam scores are almost 20 points lower than what we see in other EECS classes. . . 1 year ago in EECS 281 there was a controversy because 40 people in the same frat house took the exam together. EECS 281 did in person exams this year and the midterm median score was...mid 60's...19 points lower than when I took it online. Judging from anecdotal final exam reactions for that class I expect another low final average. . .

I lived in the First Gen theme community in Couzens Hall my freshman year and I thought it was pretty nice, and helped ease my transition to a new college/area/community.

t1_j0hvnka,2022-12-16 19:29:45,t3_znlms1,t3_znlms1,"TL;DR kinda mathy, but very low workload and pretty laid back. More theory than application. I liked it, but I'm biased because I like proof based math. If you're looking for more practice than theory, then 388 is probably what you're looking for.. . I took 475 in Winter 2022 with Mahdi Cheraghchi. Here's a loosely organized ramble about my thoughts on it.. . **Content:**. . If you've ever wondered ""how is cryptography (475) different from security (388)?"" The difference is that cryptography is the art of making a lock, while security is the art of ensuring the room guarded by that lock doesn't have its window open. So if you're looking for more theory than practice, you might like EECS 475 more than EECS 388, and vice versa.. . You don't spend a huge amount of time on specific instantiations of cryptographic schemes in 475. Instead, you largely focus on **types** of schemes you could have (e.g. signature schemes, public key encryption schemes, hash families, one way functions), and what properties those schemes could/should have (e.g. how well they can withstand attackers of varying levels of power). You'll see some specific examples of protocols, but I'd be lying if I said that was the main focus.. . **Workload:**. . It's more similar to a math class than a programming class. So whether or not you enjoy proof based math classes (or at the very least the ""intro to cryptography"" unit of EECS 376) will partially indicate whether or not you'd like EECS 475. That said, I've also heard some people who had trouble with reductions in 376 say that 475 made it make sense for them.. . I found the workload pretty laid back, which I think makes it a good choice for a first upper-level. There's 1 homework every other week, 1 take home ""midterm"" which is basically a problem set, and a final report instead of a final exam where you can e.g. read about & summarize some concept or application that wasn't directly covered in course materials. There's a few other things that are graded as well, but nothing crazy (when I took it you had to make some perusall comments every week, and you had to take scribe notes for one of the lectures for one of the lectures at some point in the semester, but both of those were basically free points).

Keep a running list of every company you use on a daily basis, even ones that don't seem ""techy"" (I knew someone who worked for Warby Parker, the glasses company! And Nike hires.) . 2. From that list, apply to a set number per day by going to their actual website and clicking ""Careers/Jobs"" and checking for New Grad jobs. I recommend an easily achievable number like 2/day and 1 bonus whenever you feel a little anxious. (If you feel anxious once every other day, this will shake out to 90 jobs in a month, 180 jobs in 2 months, 360 jobs in 3 months. Not too bad!). . Your list should keep you going for a long, long time, assuming you remember to update it anytime you use anything you think might use your skills (think: does this company have a website/app?). . . *I graduated a few years ago in a somewhat better job market so please know that while I think this definitely still works, the job market's volatility is going to make this feel a lot worse at the beginning.

Most of the first half of the semester is pretty much a SQL bootcamp, and the projects/homeworks give you a lot of practice in fundamentals.. . A lot of people I've talked to think the rest of the course is not very useful, except for the very few people who would actually *develop* databases (e.g. work at Oracle or contributing to the PostgreSQL project). Hot take: I think that's inaccurate. Here's a few reasons:. . * Second half of the course covers indexes, which are very important for speeding up queries and are something that a regular backend engineer might be expected to know how to use. You learn about how tree indexes and hash indexes work, which will help you appreciate in which situations one should be used over another. Admittedly, the course could've done a better job in giving students practice on actually *creating an index* in an actual project rather than just describing them, but it's better than nothing.. . * You get a brief introduction to NoSQL databases, how they're different from relational databases, and why they might be used instead of a relational database (If I remember correctly, I was once asked this in an interview). . * To get a better appreciation of the differences between NoSQL and relational databases, one needs to understand what normalization is, what problems it solves, and what problems it creates. Normalization is one of the last topics before the midterm.. . * The second half of the course presents several algorithms that will emphasize the difference between CPU-bound operations and I/O bound operations, which might come up in your career as a backend engineer. In 281, you only had to worry about computations that can be done in memory. Databases and other software systems will have to do computations that must perform read and write operations to disk, which are way more expensive.. . * You will get a low-stakes introduction to concepts like locking, memory vs disk access, and write-ahead logging, all of which helped me understand 482 better, if that's something you're interested in. . . * If you're interested in the design of software systems, then 484 offers an introductory look at one of the most important software systems out there, just like 482 is useful in that you get to look at how OSs are designed, just like 491 is useful in that you get to look at how distributed systems are designed. . . If none of this sounds interesting (which is ok!) then obviously don't take the course. It definitely has its flaws. Some of the projects are not well put together. The topics can seem a bit dry at times. The pedagogical value of some of the exam questions is questionable. But this is not unique to 484 and I think sometimes the class catches a lot more flak than it deserves. My view of the course has evolved since I took it three years ago. I used to think it was mostly useless too, but I have come to appreciate it more and more over time.",9.0,error,0.0

There are different workloads for applications such as OLTP and OLAP. OLTP workloads typically have many concurrent transactions that need to be processed quickly. OLAP workloads are for heavy business intelligence tasks where petabytes of data are aggregated for analysis and speed is not as important. You can use ETL to transfer data from OLTP databases to OLAP ones.. .

They specifically say that paying taxes, owning property, going to high school, having a state id, etc do NOT demonstrate permanent residence. I can't see any way this would ever be approved as it currently stands. Nothing about the current situation makes them think you are and want to remain a permanent resident. It honestly might be better, if you really want to go to U of M, to consider meeting the requirements by ensuring your parents meet the requirements or you get a job that ensures you intend to remain in the state. You might even want to take a year off or more to prove this. It obviously makes a huge difference. But you can try and make an argument.... It just seems extremely unlikely. Talk to a professional. Or consider going to u of m flint or eastern or wcc for a bit if you want to get going on college and then transfer. If you do this also talk to admissions/advisors/etc - make sure you take classes that transfer. I know people that have had great success doing this, especially u of m flint and moving to u of m ann arbor. But the key is to establish a relationship before you do anything, don't rely on redit for advice, and don't rely on google searches. Talk to a real person. And if they don't tell you what you want to hear, get a second opinion. And keep in touch with them. You you really do intend to stay in michigan and argue that you should receive in-state tuition these things might just tip the scale in your favor where on paper in an email you just won't. And if it takes a lot time or a year off, think about how much that will save you. This is why the in-state laws are strict, back in the day people would just buy a condo for their kids after they decided to go to michigan and it would pay for its self in tuition and they would just live there - those days are gone.

I'm not sure about 217 because I really haven't done a lot of proof work before, but I reviewed the exam questions for fall 22, and I don't think it was very hard. So I think the difficulty of 217 may be its workload rather than the exam. About 286, I am not sure because differential equations are a new concept for me. For 370, I think I might learn it a little easier than others, but it will also take a lot of time. After all, 370 is not like 376, which has a lot of concepts and details to grasp. I am glad that you are taking my questions seriously, and also appreciate it if you could give me advice related to my study.",1.0,neutral,0.5477862358093262

Some somewhat notable people that I'm aware of that haven't already been mentioned: . . * **[Mark Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Newman)** - known for fundamental contributions in complex networks and complex systems with his work being applied to a number of other fields, including psychology, sociology, economics and biology. He has over 200,000 citations including his paper on ""The structure and function of complex networks"" which received the most citations of any paper in mathematics between 2001 and 2011. . . * **[Robert Axelrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod)** - Also huge in complex systems, but particularly on the subject of cooperation, writing several books, including ""The Evolution of Cooperation"". His research includes innovative approaches to explaining conflict of interest, the emergence of norms, how game theory is used to study cooperation, and cross-disciplinary studies on evolutionary processes. On top of being a member of the National Academy of Science and a MacArthur Fellow, he also received the prestigious National Medal of Science from Obama in 2014. . . * **[Gerard Mourou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Mourou)** - Pioneer in electrical engineering and lasers and part winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics for chirped pulse amplification (CPA), the current state-of-the-art technique used by most of the highest-power lasers in the world. Its uses include the millions of corrective eye surgeries that are conducted every year using the sharpest of laser beams, and is expected to have a significant impact on cancer therapy and other physics research in the future. He's also the founding director of the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at Michigan.. . * **Satinder Singh Baveja** - leading pioneer in reinforcement learning and still very prominent in artificial intelligence. I think he's still considered faculty, but doesn't look like he's taught since being poached by DeepMind (forefront institution for AI) a few years ago (I hear they tripled his umich salary). * **David Dunning** - Probably not the most influential, but he's an active Psych professor that's half the namesake of the popular, Dunning-Kruger Effect (when a person's lack of knowledge and skills in a certain area cause them to overestimate their own competence). . . If we're including previous faculty, then there's also esteemed poet **Robert Frost** and cognitive psychologist and major collaborator with Daniel Kahneman, **Amos Tversky**.",48.0,error,0.0
