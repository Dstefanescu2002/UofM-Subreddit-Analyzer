The jump in difficulty from EECS 150 to EECS 280 is basically the same as that of EECS 280 to EECS 281. That is EECS 281 is not too bad as long as you stay up to date on lectures, start projects early, and have friends in the class or people to study with together (you can help each other on understanding tbe projects, but not direct implementation details). Of course EECS 281 is a pretty time consuming class because of its projects, but you should be able to get an A as long as you put the time in and did well in 280.. . EECS 370 however is pretty difficult from both a conceptual and workload perspective, especially if you are not a EE or CE. Specifically, they pretty much teach the class with the assumltion you have taken EECS 270, and all the different low-level concepts are quite difficult to understand how they work. The projects are not the worst, just they can be pretty poorly specced and you need to have a pretty good understanding of the lectures.. . I did 370 and 281 at the same time and 370 was definitely insanely hard for me since I hadnt taken 270 (I'm a CS major).

It makes somewhat sense, since the vaccine was developed and tested so rapidly that it has not really undergone a ton of testing or been studied much for long-term side effects compared to most other vaccines and such on the market. In fact, even some medical personnel, according to my mother who is a doctor, are slightly wary about side-effects of the vaccine and don't want to be admonistered the vaccine right now. . . I should note that while I'm not an authority on the subject, but I do also believe those who are under 18 or pregnant should debately not be administered the vaccine since those groups were not tested during the trials (pregnant women because of their babies, and teens because younger people have stronger immune responses). In fact, I believe that is part of the reason why when the vote came down to whether the vaccine should be released or tested more, 2-3 people voted against it citing it had not been tested a ton in children.. . . Overall though, everyone besides those two groups should 100% take the vaccine as soon as they can since so far it has been working fine and realistically there should be no major side-effects given what we have seen. And while some people might be a bit wary in the incredibly early stages of the vaccination, within a month or two, and after a large number of people have been vaccinated, they should change their mind. As well as by then perhaps pregnant women and those under 18 should be fully cleared to take the vaccine.. . Note: for those two groups I talk about who shpuld debatebly not take the vaccine, pregnant women and those under 18, I do believe I am correct about what I am saying, as it was on the news this past week, but they already may tested enough to give the all clear so I would recommend looking it up yourself or talking to a doctor.",8.0,negative,0.5426905751228333

But it felt gratifying to get things correct, and i didn't feel as though the class was trying to destroy me, unlike some other courses that I've been through. There was stuff that I didn't like in the course, but only because I didn't go to lecture. If i paid attention in lecture, I would have loved the course, but that's my own fault. . . I will say, the second half of the course gets math heavy, and i personally didn't really like it. Coupled with the fact that i didn't go to lecture, the last two months were not that much fun. But the lectures were clear imo, the textbook actually helped when i didn't go to lecture, and office hours was really helpful. So there are definitely resources if you struggle with the math. . . Something else that might be a hit or miss is discussion. Discussions are 50 minutes and they go through some concepts and 3 or 4 problems. My discussion ia/gsi usually gave us 5-10 minutes (depending on the question) to solve the problem, and then we would go through it as a class. My ia went through the solutions kind of fast, which was a bit annoying. As the course started to wrap up, fewer and fewer people decided to attend. But all of the slides are posted as a reference, and office hours will most likely be sufficient if the ia went too fast. . . There are also labs in eecs 215. They sent us (or we picked up) a box of circuit components, a signal generator thing (which connects to your computer with a cable), and a multimeter. These are what you do the labs with. I had some previous breadboard knowledge, but I felt as though the learning curve would be hard for someone without experience. But there are also lab office hours, which were helpful for the people who attended them. They also added a lab gsi later in the course who would show his circuit and the expected output on the computer. This made it easy, but there were times before the gsi when the lab instructions weren't clear enough. This led to me tearing my circuit apart multiple times only to find out that the power supply was supposed to be on or a another wire had to be attached. It also takes time to get help. I usually did my labs on the weekends because that was when things weren't as hectic, but nobody is expected to watch piazza or their email on weekends. Of course, these are things that I could have gotten around with better planning, but these problems do exist if you don't watch out for them. . . Homework in this class was imo not that bad. It's usually about 5 questions sometimes with multiple parts, sometimes not, depends on the difficulty of the problem. The times that I went to lecture, I thought the hw was easy. When I didn't go to lecture, it was hard. The book helped usually, but lectures are the standard for if you want to do well with the graded portions. Also there were some questions that required you to plot on Matlab. I personally dislike matlab, so these were a struggle, but i saw people that came to office hours with matlab questions, and the instructors were happy to help. Start early on the homework. That way you'll know if you need help or not. I don't remember how long the homeworks usually took me, but 215 hw was the thing that i really didn't need to worry about. They also drop two assignments, but do every assignment to get the best grade possible. . . Overall, i thought the course was well taught, and I'm happy that i took it. If you do what's expected of you, like go to lecture, discussion, and do the homeworks, you should be fine. I know I mentioned a lot of negatives to the class, but imo this course was quite laid back and i'm glad I took it.. . Let me know if you have any other questions. . Edit: formatting",4.0,error,0.0

That makes it 100% a self fulfilling prophecy. **Don't do that.** . . The class is considered hellish mainly because the material is all over the place and taught weirdly. . Similar reasons as to why calc 2 is often cited to be worse than calc 3 or 4. Content wise, it's not actually *that* bad. The thing about discrete math is that it's also kinda understood in a discrete way: you either completely get it or you don't understand anything at all. This is probably the only class where you can write an entire page of well reasoned solution and receive a big fat 0/8 for starting off in the wrong direction. That can be daunting but also very satisfying when you get it right. For your own sake please think of it as satisfying. . . Another thing is, chances are you're in 203 because you're a prospective CS major. If CS interests you, so should a lot of the fundamentals of this class.. . Personal opinion is that the professor who taught me (Wakefield I think) is a dick. First lecture I had with him he told us to go sign up in LSA English instead if we find this hard. This leads me to the culture of this class and sometimes CS in general: you're probably gonna feel inadequate as compared to some of your more outspoken peers. Don't let the imposter syndrome get to you. You belong here and you'll do great. . . Preparation wise, I confess that I skipped many lectures and I mostly studied the lecture slides and I ended up with a B+ which I converted to a P last semester, so the lecture slides are a good resource. . .

And his weekly quizzes are very easy. There's also extra credit opportunities in the class. The class being online and having open note exams helps out a lot. I ended with a A+ in that class. There's two lectures a week for both Econ and psych that both take about 1 hour to go through each. Discussion section for Econ 101 can be helpful....I only went to 1-2 of them.....attendance is not graded for Econ discussion, only is for psych 111. Good luck on your application process to Ross.

All excited to be able to stream for a month as well as have as consistent gym schedule. Got into EFT just before the semester started, my most intense semester I've had, and friends wanted me to get back into WoW. Funny enough I think this might be my best semester GPA wise with only 473 dragging it below 4.0.. . Stream some casual leveling in WoW most of Wednesday and loving it. Wake up sometime in the night with abdominal pain. Something is off, didn't feel like a ""normal"" stomach cramp. Let it ride for a bit and see how things go. Eventually pain spreads to the right side. UH-OH. Go to hospital and learn the pleasure that is morphine. First ever surgery. All went well but happened late enough I had to spend the night. So that's my start to my break.. . Hope everyone else's is starting off better. If anyone would like to team up in Tarkov, hit me up.

t1_gg8d8b4,2020-12-18 07:58:15,t3_kfcvpp,t3_kfcvpp,"The content in EECS 203 can be partitioned into 3 subsets. The first third covers logic, set theory, functions, proofs and sequences/series, and sets you up for the rest of the class. The next third covers some basic combinatorics, discrete probability and a little bit of relations. The last third does more relations, orderings of a set, graphs, algorithms, complexity, number theory and some cryptography. The class covers a lot, and by the EECS department's own admission, is about 1.5 semesters worth of content -- content that doesn't always feel as if it cohesively builds up on material from earlier parts of the class.. . It gets wild really fast, and often the material, though very interesting, is covered so quickly that it can get hard to keep up with. To keep up, don't fall behind on lectures, as playing catch-up can be very painful. Go to Graetz's lectures, they're really, really good. Like another poster here has said, the lecture slides are a good resource (especially to review things you don't understand), but you may not get away with skipping lectures and solely relying on reading the slides, so it's safest not to do that. . . Go to discussion and ask questions, and shop around till you find an IA you like (my favorite one graduated, so I can't really give you a recommendation). Get started on your homework early, as it can take some time to finish. Go to office hours, not Chegg -- aside from being not very good for your learning, people have been honor-coded for blindly copying blatantly wrong answers.. . The exams are unfortunately very competitive, and aren't very easy. You don't really get many practice exams either. Do all of them, and if it helps you, do them again. I think 203 staff likes it when you make review materials (they gave out extra credit for it once), and strongly believes that it helps you do better, so please do that. . . . As for resources, here are some:. . I never used this, but one of my friends in another school was saved by youtuber TheTrevTutor's discrete math content. It might be useful.. . During break, read this (https://www.math.drexel.edu/~jblasiak/JoyofSets.pdf), and this (https://www.math.drexel.edu/~jblasiak/MathematicalHygiene.pdf). These handouts were created by Michigan professors, and give you a very gentle introduction to set theory and mathematical logic. It'll make your life easier for the first 3 weeks, and you won't feel as lost as many of your classmates if you do that. . . . Another thing that could be helpful is taking MATH 201. It's a 1-credit class (credit/no credit grading) that the math department recommends everyone doing MATH 217 to enroll in. But you don't need to be in MATH 217 to do it. As it's an introduction to mathematical writing/proofs, it's going to be very, very helpful for EECS 203, 376, and so on and so forth.. . The handout posted by u/Logan_Z_Z (http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~smdbackr/MATH/Mathematical_Writing_A_Primer.pdf) in another comment in this thread is what you'll cover in the class. (also, scroll to the back of it, to the ""Resources"" section, and read More Joy of Sets). You meet in the math lab once or twice a week (depending on how fast you complete the worksheets) for two hours at a time. You write proofs for at least 90% of the questions in the handout, with IAs walking around to help you if you get stuck and to check your work when you're done. There is no homework -- it's just practice at proofs, and you'll find the content in EECS 203 much easier as a result, especially the first third.",22.0,error,0.0

Its can be annoying and a lot of energy but advocating for yourself early and often establishes a tone where your roommates won't try to take advantage. It may not always get you friends, but would you rather not rock the boat or have peace in your home?. . 3. Write stuff down. Keep notes. This is to protect yourself if things go volatile.

I lived there my sophomore year in a 2 bedroom 2 person apartment (1634 Murfin) and enjoyed the quiet environment and the low density. I had almost all my classes on Central (despite living on North all 4 years lmao) so I did have to get used to the fact that Bursley (and therefore Bursley-Baits) is a 5 minute walk, which was a little unfortunate for cross campus transit.

Pro: Most people keep to themselves, so there's relatively few loud parties or even loud conversations. Long, peaceful walks are the norm. That peace and quiet meant I could have my windows open all year and not have to close them due to noise.. .

Also, half the reason I had the window open in January was because I couldn't control the heat in my apartment.. . Pro: Furniture and a private bathroom, plus private spacious bedrooms and a large living room. It's hard to get that kind of stuff at a dorm. Having a fridge was really useful, and though my roommate and I never cooked anything, we at least had that option.. . Con: Northwood is old and half the stuff was broken lmao. Fridge worked great, but the oven door was more like a detachable lid.

Say you need an operation that costs $10K and you don't have insurance to pay for it. You need help to pay for this and apply for assistance at a variety of sources.. . First the hospital comes in and says OK, we have an indigent patient fund we can dip into to cover the $10K in cost. But then you hear from a local church who says they will provide $2K towards this surgery from its emergency fund. What happens next: Do you get the operation using $10K of the hospital fund, and then pocket the $2K from the church? Or does the $2K go to the hospital and then they only have to use $8K of their patient care fund to cover the remaining costs?. . Where it might be trickier is this: What if the hospital was only going to fund $8K in fees, so you were supposed to pay for $2K from your savings. Then, as in the other example, a church also offers $2K. Does the church's $2K get used to fill in the ""gap"" so you get the surgery fully paid for? Or does the church money get applied first, so the hospital reduces its aid by $2K (so you still have to pay $2K yourself)? . .

I do not think I should have to illustrate how there is a difference between drawing a personified rabbit vs. calling someone a bitch, lower than a dog, a savage, an animal, etc.. . It is also dissimilar to claiming that niggardly is a racist word--there is no etymological connection between that word and the n-word. The phrase ""crack the whip"" is directly derived from the very physical action of slave masters or cattle drivers cracking their whips. Slaves were treated as chattel, like farm animals, so whether the phrase originally came about from slavers or cattle drivers makes little difference. It is likely even that it arose independently from both. Either way, the phrase evokes an image of whipped human beings and would be popularly associated with slavery, hence why we are able to have this conversation at all.. . However, there is one similarity to niggardly that I will allow--this word is very similar to the n-word and most people would perceive it as such, just as most people perceive ""crack the whip"" as relating to slavery. In fact, I would be very surprised if most modern uses of niggardly were not attempts at simply turning the n-word into an adjective, rather than following its prescribed definition. That the actual definition of the word unfortunately plays into negative racial stereotypes does little to help it's case. So, what is the take away from all of this? Just don't use the word. It's simply not a polite thing to do. Anyone that does use it is likely trying to be edgy, argumentative, or otherwise contrarian because it is sure to ruffle some feathers, and they would know this. They also might be testing the waters for more racist language (as that is how this word would be perceived), using the dictionary definition of the word as a way to back down if they are challenged. It's just so incredibly suspicious to use such a niche word that is almost certain to upset someone. I would argue it's a much more egregious violation of social norms than using the phrase ""to crack the whip,"" actually.. . Coming back to your comment, now. I think you are wrong in saying that the university is ""training people to take offense"" of anything, and I don't think it is a workplace's business to train people not to take offense of things, either. What anyone is offended by is an incredibly subjective thing that is usually related to their experiences or identity, so trying to instruct them out of being offended by something could very easily trespass into invalidating very real experiences. On the other hand, we should generally avoid saying things that might be offensive to others, and we should almost never be so presumptuous as to say that someone taking offense to something is wrong for doing so, as long as it is clear they are engaging in good faith. That would be deeply childish and would require one to presume that their own feelings are somehow superior to someone else's (i.e. you were not offended, they were, they are wrong even though the question of offense is entirely subjective). All of this is basic politeness and respect, something which should be expected in any workplace, though it may take different forms depending on the implicitly and explicitly agreed upon norms of the workplace.. . Then bringing it back around to ""cracking the whip."" Is it a fire-able or disciplinary offense to say crack the whip? Even if there are explicit rules for what should happen if this phrase is said, any disciplining authority would have discretion with the case. How would it normally go? I think we can assume that people will generally be rational when dealing with something like this, so it probably wouldn't be a big deal. So why add this phrase to the list?. . Well, if the phrase were directed at a Person of Color, even unwittingly, it could be understandably upsetting for them. No one can read your mind, so even if you were to communicate that it was not your intention to make them uncomfortable, there is no way they could know this for sure. The damage is already done. It is my guess that including the phrase on this list is just raising the possibility that a situation like this could arise, and then suggesting that it could be smoothly avoided by saying the phrase less. It is a very simple, nearly costless solution. All it is is adjusting the parameters of what should or should not be included in polite conversation, a process that has been ongoing for as long as we have had language and formalities.. . Now, if there were serious infractions associated with saying, ""crack the whip,"" that would be a problem. I don't think that's what's going on here. I perceive no loss in saying the phrase less (I never really had it worked into my repertoire, anyway), so I find this policy change perfectly agreeable. There is no slippery slope. If policing of speech were to become an actual problem, that is something I would be against as soon as the issue became apparent. I do not think that is the case here.",1.0,error,0.0

Absolutely untrue, there are more slaves today than during the height of triangular slave trade, though of course the relative numbers are down significantly. It is also unlikely that whips are employed to the same extent they once were.. . >The comparison is not absurd.. . It is and I am not going to engage any further if you refuse to recognize this simple fact among others you continue to deny. Calling someone a dog when they are cosplaying as a furry has a different connotation to it than calling someone a dog when you are threatening them with a gun, or claiming they are racially inferior. The context language is used in is everything. Racially charged language is leagues away from disney. Regardless, my only point with the original comparison to animals, is that slaves were literally treated as you might treat a cow, which is part of why crack the whip can apply to both of them. Again, to draw a cute personified rabbit is different than treating someone as you might treat a cow.. . >Nor have you presented any evidence whatsoever. . The actual definition of the phrase and its common usage and understanding heavily allude to slavery, which I have repeatedly demonstrated. One might say, ""yeah my manager really cracked the whip at work today."" This would be thoughtlessly processed in passing, but with any amount of imagery you could easily imagine the manager whipping his workers, the whip cracking as it flies. Even if this cracking is limited to just the air (the usage of the phrase suggests otherwise), the entire point of cracking a whip is to threaten that you might whip someone/thing. I do not think most people are so obtuse as you that this point would be lost on them. Again, it seems you are being almost intentionally dense.. . \> While it may not be the province of a workplace to instruct people, it is absolutely to province of a *university* to do so.. . This list was devised for the University's IT department, not for its students. You are so plainly wrong yet again. It is increasingly difficult for me to believe you are engaging in good faith.. . >speech policing. . I think we can both agree that policing inherently requires punishment for rule breaking, otherwise it is merely observing or advising. It is not clear to me that there are any ramifications for saying any of the phrases on this list, or that each word/phrase they is held to an equal standard as the others. I think it is safe to assume that if a case escalates to the point that some sort of intervention is required, whether the offending words were on this list or not will likely have little impact on the following disciplinary action.. . >Your entire argument seems to boil down to the notion that other people must predict your ignorant misinterpretations of words/phrases and how some other group of people might be offended in your imagination.. . My ignorant misinterpretations of words/phrases? Offended by my imagination? At no point have I given my truly personal interpretation of these phrases. Instead I have described them according to their definitions, common usage and understanding, as well as how they might be viewed from specific perspectives, in some cases. It is my personal opinion that to say ""crack the whip"" is not so bad a thing, but I can imagine instances where it could cause discomfort, especially if it is used in a directed manner against a person of color. That is the perspective this list is almost certainly coming from, and given that it is almost guaranteed that no one will lose a job, promotion, or other workplace opportunity over using these words, I see no issue with this phrase being included on the list at all.. . The concern is not that other people must predict ""my"" preferences. Instead, I have simply noted that it is common courtesy in any setting, especially that of a professional workplace, to avoid saying things which might make people uncomfortable. We do this in every setting. We censor our thoughts and code-switch depending on who we're talking to. This list is not something revolutionary, it will likely only be partially adhered to, if at all, and it has no disciplinary teeth, meaning that the context and tone that specific language is used in will likely have far greater bearing for any disciplinary action than whether it was on this list or not.. . So ultimately, the list does not matter, and while I don't see ""crack the whip"" as being that big of a deal, there is an obvious connection to slavery that can be drawn, particularly in the scenarios I have mentioned. Why you so fervently wish to deny that such a link could ever be drawn, I have no idea.

If you use a whip on an animal or person, it does not 'crack'.. . The crack of a whip is caused from a loop in the whip travelling faster than the speed of sound--it need not occur in open air (i.e. the tip of the whip need not be free for the entirety of motion, as you imply). The specific, ear shattering crack of a supersonic whip is not the only cracking sound a whip will make, either, though it is certainly the loudest. You could experiment with a particularly long belt for a while, you will notice you do not need to break your eardrums to get a sound out of it. All of this can occur either in the action of whipping an object or the air, the latter coming with the explicit threat of a whipping (this is what whips are for), and thus without much of a difference. Seriously, just go whip something.. . > The phrase itself originates from England and has nothing to do with slavery.. . The origin of the phrase, like most, is not perfectly known. I think it is likely that it was independently discovered at multiple points in time before trade sufficiently unified the English lexicon (a process still in the making even today). Regardless, I do not subscribe to the prescriptive view of language, but the descriptive. That is to say, language is something we actively develop and interpret, rather than a set of rules and definitions which is handed down to us. This allows for multiple interpretations of the meaning, to ""crack a whip."" Again, even if the phrase originally applied to enslaved animals, when you are using it on people, the connection to enslaved people is practically drawn for you. I'm not going to go over that again, though.. . > Except you've been wrong every time. You clearly don't understand what 'cracking a whip' literally means and you've invented an origin for the phrase that bears no resemblance to its actual origin.. . The definition is not wrong, the usage of the phrase I have provided is not wrong (""the manager really cracked the whip today""), the understanding of the phrase I have provided is supported by my own understanding, that of other commenters, the list we are discussing, and many more that have had a discussion similar to ours that can be found with quick googles. That there are people that interpret the phrase in this way quite literally means that ""crack the whip"" means as I say (at least in one interpretation). All language is is what we interpret it to be, and if a phrase has some critical mass of interpretation, then that is what it means. So where am I ""wrong every time?"" A subjective interpretation cannot be wrong.. . The ""bears no resemblance to its actual origin"" is insane, too. Clearly, both farm animals and slaves were whipped, indeed both were considered in the same class of chattel, so my usage of the phrase is in fact directly in line with its original meaning. Since the phrase is typically used nowadays to talk about people, rather than animals, I would argue my usage of the phrase is actually MORE accurate. But I don't think I will convince you of that.. . > Then why issue it?. .

It does get more difficult to meet people, unless you are lucky and make friends with the people you work with. In that case, it can be awesome because you get to be with people you get along with every day vs college where you have to spend a lot of time in class/studying.

My point is: many things change in life and college is just one step on the road. When I look back at my time at UM for undergrad, I tend to remember only happy/fun times: parties, floating on the river, exploring new places, etc. The thing is, the reality is that most of my college time was spent studying to keep my head above water. People have rose-colored glasses when they talk about college as the ""best years of your life"". Especially if you are pre-med or engineering, I'd strongly argue that things are better all-around after college (med school is a debate of course). No anxiety about tests, a salary, freedom to change jobs and location, etc. You couldn't pay me to go back at this point.. .

I wanted to thank you all for your thoughtful responses. They have been incredibly helpful. I came to several realizations with your help as well as talking things out with my counselor and journaling on my own: 1) I'm not alone in struggling in my doctoral program, which has made me feel less alone and has helped me to work through my guilt. I still have a ways to go with letting go of guilt, but I'm working on it. . (2)The big reasons why I've been wanting to quit are because I feel behind and am struggling with depression. I have worked through mental health issues at other points in grad school, but the last time my depression flared up this suddenly and severely was in high school, when I let go of several opportunities after I felt that the sadness and lack of motivation were unbearable. I regretted letting go of those opportunities for a long time and don't want to do that again, so I want to try to push myself to stay. . (3) On one of my first nights of grad school, I went out to dinner with my cohort and an older male colleague sitting next to me got drunk, reached over and picked up a piece of asparagus** from *my* plate, and rubbed the asparagus on my face. Excuse the CAPS-lock, but it makes me FURIOUS to think that ""Asparagus Man,"" as my sister and I call him, will get a PhD and I won't. That is my call to action. If he can become Dr. Asparagus, I can and will become Dr. InsomniaConfessions. . . (4) Since Day 1, I have lived with fearing that the grad program will ""kick me out"" suddenly, I thus will not have good professional references, and I will not be able to get a job or the health insurance that I need to take care of my condition. . . I think that this fear is connected to the medical care for my condition being quite high stakes, as well as the Imposter Complex experienced by many graduate students and especially under-represented students. I had this fear even when excelling in my first and second years. It never fully occurred to me that the program would be reluctant to kick students out because they've already made an investment in us and because they need us to teach courses. . -I never stopped to consider how exhausting, draining, and discouraging this fear is for me and how it is at the root of a lot of the shame, anxiety, and sadness I feel when I don't meet my expectations in the program. . (5) I am now at a place where I can hold myself in some compassion and finish up what I need to finish now, and keep trucking along. Spending time reflecting on the fear that I discuss in (4) has helped me to begin to let go of the fear and realize that if it would ever come true and the program would indeed kick me out, I can find a new path then.. . Also: . -Services for Students with Disabilities has already advocated for me in the past. I am so thankful for the work that they do.

t1_ghb36nu,2020-12-28 18:00:06,t1_ghaxlh1,t3_klhoyz,"Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I was on mobile last night so didn't really have the capability (or desire, honestly) for a long response. But since I've been vilified and I think misunderstood, I'll give it a shot. . . Perhaps it wasn't already clear, but I'm not against *some form* of shutdowns or limitation on social actvity. I just feel strongly that disallowing indoor dining entirely (especially in colder regions, like Chicago), is a lazy and short-sighted solution to the covid problem.. . If you're curious what data I'm using to draw conclustions, I've looked carefully at cases and deaths per 100K population, both in different countries and among different states in the US. Hyperlinks isn't working right now so here are links:. . * [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality) (country analysis). * [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases\_deathsper100klast7days](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_deathsper100klast7days) (state analysis). . In the deaths per 100K population by state, there is no correlation between deaths and extent of lockdowns. Florida has had very limited restrictions on activity, but has a low death per population rate. Illinois has a higher one while mandating strict lockdowns. Conversely, Indiana has a higher rate, coupled with less restrictive lockdowns. . . There are obviously tons of factors at play, including quality and access of good healthcare, average health and age of each state's population, etc. - but that's kind of my point. Restuarants can't really be entirely blamed for more deaths, so why are we shutting them down? Over the summer Chicago restaurants were allowed indoor dining at 25-40% capacity, and we didn't see cases and deaths surging then. . . By the way - you can definitely say that restuarant actvitity is less now than it was in the summer, when cases were dropping and at much lower levels than now. I didn't mean to imply that we should compare that to the March/April period. I also didn't mean to suggest there are blanket shutdowns everywhere in the US. Again, I'm mostly thinking of Chicago, where I live and see the impact every day. Four businessess on my block in Lincoln Park have closed due to shutdowns. . . I think we're on the same side for the most part, I just don't think the burden of proof should be on restaurants to prove that they don't spread covid. I also think that shutting down restaurants just encourages more in-home gatherings, which almost certianly are not adhering to any social distiancing guidelines. . . Cheers!",0.0,error,0.0

From the professor side, the pandemic situation has substantially increased the amount of other work we have to do, which leaves less time for advising like this, unfortunately. Also, because research has generally slowed down, it's also tougher to complete research projects so I can free up more advising time for new students. I suspect most profs will be limiting their students for these reasons (ymmv). It's a frustrating situation too, as I know most faculty enjoy working with undergrads, but we're mostly trying to just stay sane and support our current students (along with with teaching classes, service work, etc. etc). . . If i was looking, I'd suggest. . * target professors with senior PhD students and/or postdocs. There's a decent chance they'll have more free time and you could help out on one of their research projects (you might want to see if you can figure out what they're working on too beforehand). * Look for very new faculty who are joining in the Winter (less common) and may not have anyone working with them yet. Those faculty are typically fresh out of PhD/postdoc and will work with you more closely. * Email with a specific list of their (or their student's) projects you're interested in. I realize this is more work, but it can *really* help figure out if there's a quick alignment between the student and something that needs working on. And it's also a good sign. * If you're feeling creative/adventurous, feel free to pitch your own research idea, but realize that a professor will view it as a significantly larger investment of their time (compared with having you join an existing study/project).. * Be prepared to do some un-fun grunt work like bench work, qualitative coding, or annotating. Those are very necessary for research and often where having another person is needed. While they're time intensive, as a researcher just starting out, they're often useful in the long run too for getting a sense of what goes in (and often the data that comes out sparks new ideas). * The biggest issue for most students is time commitment. It's almost impossible to make progress with 4-5hrs/week when just starting out. And from my perspective, most of student's research time goes out the window when midterms and projects start (research seems to be the first to go). I'd be up front about your time and see how to keep a schedule that works for you.. * Email early and then follow up when (if?) they don't respond. Most profs have terrible inboxes right now so don't take it personally, but the follow up email shows you're actually interested and not emailing 100+ profs. Also, I'll feel guilty for not responding to the first one.. . Good luck!",6.0,error,0.0

t1_ghpzkdr,2021-01-01 15:27:59,t1_ghoe3iv,t3_knucm3,"You're a Michigan student, so you're probably pretty smart. Pause for a second and take a huge step back. . . . . These dorms do not belong to you. They belong to the state. Just because these buildings are usually used to house university students under normal circumstances does not change the fact that they are 1) public buildings, or 2) housing. They're not special just because they're usually used by one group of people some of the time. . . . . Since the university will only be opening dorms for students with a demonstrated need, MANY dorms will be standing empty. Certainly more dorms than there are houseless persons in the city, probably by multiples. The homeless population has increased during the pandemic. The city makes an effort through the Delonis center to give these people a bed at night. The delonis center cannot accommodate this increase, and rather than continue to spend finite taxpayer money ahead of a year of significantly decreased revenue, the city's elected representatives want to have a conversation to make use of a STATE BUILDING that is standing empty so that people literally don't have to SLEEP ON THE STREET IN A MICHIGAN WINTER.. . . . As for your concerns about how these people will treat the space -- what is with your assumptions that people who are homeless are, as a group, so wildly different from everyone else on the levels of sanity, drug use, and cleanliness? People become homeless for many reasons, but almost always because they can't do one thing, which is make rent for a period of time. That is not a necessary indication of some kind of mental, moral, or cognitive deficiency. It's a sign of POVERTY. Just not having enough money. Period. Your assumptions that people without homes are somehow worse or dirtier are not just incorrect, they're dangerous. . . . . It's much easier to say that you can't help these people if you put them in a category that you believe you could never occupy. It is much easier to deny these people care if you pretend that their needs are wildly different from your own. They're not. They are people who deserve dignity and shelter and basic care. They are JUST LIKE YOU. The only difference between you and the people at the delonis center is rent money. That's it. . . . . Do you know that students are a protected class in housing law? That means that there are laws with specific provisions saying that you cannot refuse to rent to someone because they're a student. Why? Because landlords refused to rent to students because they believed students to be wild, disrespectful of people and property, substance abusers, or that they might have too many guests. When you say that the university should let empty buildings stand empty, you are saying that people should sleep on the street because you fear that they might be or do these same things! Or maybe you think that the city should continue to pay for hotel rooms even when they literally have public housing buildings that are not being used. Tell me-- why? Because the students have some special claim to housing here? The students who aren't coming back are students who don't have a demonstrated need for housing. These people need housing. The housing exists. Let them use it. What is so complicated about that?!. . . . Are you saying that, among the university population, you don't have anyone with mental health issues, substance abuse issues, or people who are disrespectful of property? I sincerely doubt it. So how are these people different?. . . What if their friends come? What if they don't leave? Well, shelters have rules. You can look them up on the Delonis shelter website. Have you ever seen a crowd form by the bus station on Huron under the bridge near the YMCA in the evenings? That's the Delonis center, and people are required to be out of the center during the day and check back in at night. They're lining up to get a bed for the night. They follow the rules. Where do they go during the day? Well, begging for your cash near the diag sometimes, but to warming stations during the winter months because it is *too cold to stay outside safely.* What if they bring their friends? If their friends are homeless then they should check in and get a bed. If their friends aren't homeless, then there are rules and people follow them. Again, shelters with beds typically are closed during the day.. . . . Also, don't worry, you almost certainly wouldn't be housed in the same building. There are multiple dorms. They'd shuffle you around. You wouldn't have to look at something that makes you feel *uncomfortable.*. . . . We are just talking about beds at night and warming stations during the day. Just access to the resources that are owned by the state and currently sitting empty and unused during a time when there is an increased need for them. In these conditions, students do not have a greater claim to them than anyone else, and these resources are not at greater risk for damage or misuse by the homeless population than they are when they are being used by students!. . . . Nobody should suffer exposure when there are buildings available for ANY reason. People who are homeless are just that -- people without homes -- and nothing else! I'm asking you to think also why you put protecting property (not ""trashing"" the rooms or whatever) before protecting human life and dignity. Why are you more worried about the dorms than these peoples lives? What could possibly make protecting property more important than protecting people?. . . The only right answer is NOTHING.

Plenty of hardworking people become homeless, many of them have mental health issues and no access to help for them. Many of them are veterans who served this country. And with the past year, in a pandemic that has devastated people not just in terms of health but also economically and mentally, our homeless shelter infrastructure is insufficient. It's ridiculous to fault the homeless population for this. Devastating events like this can cause housing uncertainty in even college educated people (who, according to you, should get special privileges over the dirty lazy Poors beyond those borne out of simple wealth and resources). My college-educated parents went into debt to during the great recession to pay for things like food so that we wouldn't lose our house and effectively become homeless (relying on the kindness of relatives to host us, which these people often lack especially if they come from poverty or are mentally ill and estranged from family). Just the prospect of losing my home was a traumatizing time of my life but boy am I glad for it today since I have basic shreds of human decency and don't look down upon the less fortunate. . .

There may be consequences, but I shouldn't be liable for yours and you shouldn't be liable for mine. Even with mental illnesses, you still have the same freedoms to choose your path through life. Choosing drugs and alcohol over feeding your children or paying child support is a scummy decision (way more prevalent amongst homeless people than homeless veterans btw), and I have no respect for decisions like this. Choosing to go to school and become a decent contributor to society makes you an excellent person, and deserving of my respect. . . Saying people have no choice over their scenarios is again not true. If they don't want to freeze, then they should choose to take a train/bus to Florida, Texas, or California. Alcoholism is choosing alcohol so repeatedly it becomes a dependancy. You shouldn't need abortions if you choose to have safe sex which is easier than ever today with all the contraceptives available. Also, saying there is a back up system for people who fail Uni is completely wrong too. If you slip up and fail out of Uni, you still have to pay all that debt off, waste precious time of your youth, while you still only can't hold a job above a HS diploma. You have no idea what anyone else with ""privilege"" has to fall back upon.. . And please stop saying you are ""privileged"" all the time; It is a terrible tool that people use to demean your stature and power in an argument. If you got a solid argument don't bend, break, nor let people tell you that you are privileged so your voice shouldn't matter. Some people will be worse off than you, but this you can't control. The system we inherit gives you remarkable freedoms and choices and it's up to you to look out for your own well being and be smart, quick, and adaptable with those choices. You should know the quip ""with great power comes great responsibility."" This should be the social expectation, and the fact that we don't set that precedent early means people to go through their whole life not accepting responsibilities over their own livelihoods forcing people like you and I to continue to help them out. It will never stop until you set some kind of precedent. The only thing I care about is you accepting responsibility over your actions, not you waving an arbitrary privilege card.

I not only take on responsibility on my behalf, but on behalf of all the people who work so hard for me, and this leads to growth. I also still live on campus, only a block away from the Union. Putting the homeless people in South quad for instance will put these people outside my house during the day and make my block less safe.

Sorry you're incapable of understanding the ways in which you're privileged and think that everything you've accomplished in life is because of you, and you alone, but you ""give"" such a good life to others. . . Understanding the ways I'm privileged has made my life richer, emotionally and intellectually. Privilege does exist in many forms, not the least of which is financial. Most of the students at this university are very well off financially, not through their own merit. The median annual family income of students at this university is over $200k. Those aren't kids quivering in fear of defaulting on their student loans and in most cases their risk is only so much as their parents let them have. To argue that they have earned that because their parents earned it is some twisted form of social darwinism. I'm capable of discerning what I've been given through luck of the draw, in various contexts, globally: being born in the global west, having a family that is college educated, currently gainfully employed, and supportive of me, etc, and what I've earned myself in the face of that context.

I'm just confused what exactly you think will happen if they house homeless people temporarily while the dorms are unoccupied.

It's not like they're shipping in homeless people either. They are already in the community. Temporarily fixing one of their many problems is just being humane. I'd be much more pleased to have sustained public investment in assisting the homeless population and general less fortunate in society than just this one small temporary measure. But this measure will do for now. I don't believe that there's nothing I can do to help people, and I hope I never do.

There is plenty we should do, and convincing myself I shouldn't because I'm better than them isn't ok with me. Seems like it's ok with you.

My father was laid off for a whole summer right after he just bought a new home while my step mom was defaulting on college loans. No one came to bail him out, at the end of the day my father chose to work and stay in the auto industry and marry the way he did, and that's what happens sometimes. You make decisions and you suffer consequences, good or bad. The only difference is I never saw it as a setback, when you seem to lean on it like you were among the oppressed, which just sounds unempathetic to me. . . Next, let me clear, you seem to think I don't care about the helping the homeless, when this is completely false. Again, I have brought homeless people into my home and sheltered them. From meeting the people and understanding where they came from the biggest factor leading to homeless is making poor decisions. If they want help, I gave it to them a decision they can think about. Go out and work just 20 hours a week minimum wage and you should be able to pay off the amortization rate on a 30 year 3.5% interest 100k home which can be found all over the State of Michigan. If that's not enough money, go work more hours. Then they won't be homeless anymore! And better yet, they own the home and can sell it once they no longer need it. How exciting!? . . So I repeat my self because I believe taking on risk and responsibility for decisions you make is the path to actually grow in our society. You chose to go to school, here at michigan, chose to take on debt, then you had to pick your major, pick your house, pick your friends, pick your career, significant other, so on and so forth. Most of which I assume you chose well and should be rewarded for the time, effort, and money you spent stick up to those decisions. This is called ""taking on risk and responsibility"". If you fail to chose wisely or choose at all there leaves you very little room to grow. You will gain little to no assets, and you have nothing of value to put your name on. . . Also, you seem to advocate for government solutions to the individual's problems, and this will always our disconnect. Anytime anyone relies on someone else for their own well being, they will always be unsatisfied and ask for more. Likewise when we rely on the government for our wellbeing, we will always want more and more, never to be satisfied. The only difference is our government is terribly inefficient at supplying peoples needs and does it at a tremendous economic disservice to everyone else under the guise of a public good. . . Long story short, I still just find it unfair that they kicked students out of the dorms and now they think that homeless people automatically deserve housing in them, just because it's available. It's an instance that favors people that don't belong there over people who do. It's a completely idiotic idea and it's unfair to you and I who had to earn our place there and then promptly pay for it. (And I still have 20K in debt). Again go tell DPSS to go look after grown ass people, more than half of whom are completely capable of providing for themselves. It's just not fair to you, me, nor our community.",2.0,error,0.0

Wouldn't that just endanger staff and the new residents?*. . Nobody is talking about ""cramming it full of homeless people."" We're talking about using empty space safely. Last I checked, undergrads can request housing based on health, wellness or safety concerns, financial need, specific academic need (international or student employees), or for other extraordinary circumstances. The remainder of the students who typically reside in the dorms, \~10k or so including grad students, who do not fit that description will go home. Even with the new policy of one student per room, we're easily talking about hundreds or even thousands of empty beds. The Delonis center has 50 beds. Even if they're at five times their regular capacity, we're only at the very low end of our conservative estimate. Even if there were a true shortage of beds, (which, lets be clear, there absolutely is not), housing some people safely is better than not housing anybody.. . *Who will hire the extra security and add the double locking doors with the buzzers like they have at the Delonis Shelter?*. . Firstly, there are all kinds of problems with policing needier people more simply because they're needy, but I'll answer your question within the confines of these things as they operate currently. I assume that there's some security at the dorms already -- keycards? desk workers? we can leverage that. The University also has what is basically its own police force, and I'm sure those people are underworked right now and really need a paycheck. Two birds, one stone.. . *Do you understand that many homeless only go to Delonis when it is cold out, because during warm months they prefer to sleep outside so that they can do drugs and be fucked up, which isn't allowed at Delonis?*. . Okay, so you're acknowledging that there is a greater need (or even just use) of the Delonis center in the winter months -- I agree! You're also attributing this to the fact that people can't get high in the Delonis center and that this is enforced so successfully that it impacts bed usage that's visible between the seasons. Great! We can implement the same protocol, and people will not stay the night high. Glad to know we're in agreement that this works. Unless you were making the argument that people who are addicted to drugs are less deserving of shelter, which I'll just assume you weren't saying.. . *Who is going to pay for the enivitable damage, energy, and operation costs?*. . Probably cheaper than the ongoing hotel initiative considering the town won't have to rent the rooms from a public business. Plus, you might also see a decrease in petty crime if you give people places to go where they can be safe and warm, which also saves money. Also, as I said in my original comment, the idea that homeless people are more likely to damage the dorm than students are is totally misguided and based in prejudice, not evidence.. . *Also, 14.1% of the budget for U of M comes from the state. Why not suggest hotels, unoccupied apartments, or open office space be used?*. . Did you read the article? We're currently using hotels. The dorms are public buildings owned by the state and they're standing empty. We own the buildings. We don't have to rent more space, the space exists. The dorms are the space. Also, crucially, this is a public health issue, and we should be engineering public solutions using public resources, like the University. U of M belongs to all of us, including Michiganders who are currently facing homelessness. It is not the personal playground of any out of state person who has the money to pay tuition! It is a *public* entity and should be fully on the table when considering *public* solutions to a *public health crisis.*. . *Have you taken in a homeless person into your own home?*. . So this actually isn't the question to ask, and whether I have or not is irrelevant. The dorms, that is to say the buildings, are not your home. Your dorm *room* may be your home, and you may have common access to common areas, but the entire dorm building is not your home. There are rules against storing your personal property in the hallway, right? That's not your home, that's a public space. Nobody is asking you to share your bed or share your room or anything like that. And, if this were implemented, you probably wouldn't even share the same buildings. Again, we're up against the same issues: One, that this resource belongs to the state (meaning it belongs to Michiganders collectively) and we, through our elected representatives, get to make a decision about how we want to use this resource to best serve our community at any given time. And two, that this resource is not currently being used, **so people are basically arguing that this resource should remain untapped because they don't want certain people to have it.**. . It's not about whether it's possible, it's about whether we believe it should be done, and if you think that homeless people don't deserve to sleep in buildings that are currently standing empty then just come out and say it and save us all the rhetorical gymnastics.",1.0,error,0.0

It seems like you don't understand what the word empathize means. My dad wasn't trying not to work. He actively sought out positions and took a number of contract positions during that time which pay less and are temporary. He made the best choices available to him. Sometimes that isn't enough.. . And you seem to be completely missing the point that you and I and most of the people at this university have made good decisions. Good for us. But we're also positioned so that our mistakes aren't as devastating for us as they are for people who start off at a worse starting position. To ignore that is giving yourself too much credit, and not enough to the less fortunate. I'm sorry I don't constantly suck myself off for accomplishing what I was expected to accomplish based on the situation into which I was born. I have gratitude for the support system that helped me accomplish what I have, but I'm not vain enough to take credit for that support as a personal accomplishment of my own. Again, your whole basis is essentially social darwinism. . . Besides, there are a number of barriers preventing homeless people from doing your proposed solution of buying a cheap house. Firstly, getting a job, especially in this job market, isn't just a matter of snapping your fingers. And homeless people don't have addresses to list on applications. They probably don't have phone numbers either. They don't have access to showers, laundry, etc for job interviews. They might not have a valid form of ID, or means to get one.. Houses that cheap exist usually in more rural areas which also require a car to get to the jobs to pay the mortgages, assuming they could get one, but most homeless people I'm guessing aren't the top credit applicants, and likely have higher interest rates than a standard 30 year amortization. Cars cost money to purchase even if you finance them and again with financing they'd likely be paying higher rates than you or I (who made good choices yes, but I was also given personal finance tips from my family who made good choices that I won't presume to take credit for because I'm *not* a social Darwinist ), plus insurance, plus maintenance. And even presuming they could afford the mortgage on a house at higher interest rates, they'd need to be able to rely on their hours to keep up mortgage payments, which is not something that one working minimum wage positions can do necessarily. I don't know if you have ever had one but the idea that minimum wage workers can just ""work more hours"" when they want is ludicrous. They certainly have some choices there but there's tons out there on minimum wage jobs inconsistent scheduling that you can read if you really care so I'm not going to keep going on about it. You should read $2 a day, living on almost nothing in America. It's a book by a UMich professor, actually. Thankfully my education provided me with the opportunity to learn about struggles I haven't experienced and help foster greater empathy. I think it'd do you good.. . It's all very ironic you're faulting me for acting a victim just for being realistic about life, while you fancy yourself a victim because they might temporarily house homeless people in dorms that you feel entitled to, while I'm perfectly okay with that. . .

It's just not safe to have THAT MANY people on top of each other because of the explosive spreading potential this thing has demonstrated.

However, implicit in these questions is prejudice against homeless people. This doesn't mean that students don't deserve answers, but it does mean some people might pick up on that prejudice and want to downvote. . . . Of course those in charge should address concerns, but homeless people are not some ultra-violent group of uniquely filthy people who break things for fun. They need help. The pandemic has launched tens of millions of people nationally into a state of unbelievable precarity and the government is failing miserably in its response. We should want to fix this problem, not worry about how to check if homeless people are sane enough to receive shelter. Guys, everyone deserves shelter, even the junkies and the hobos and the lunatics.. . . Do we see a significantly greater percentage of people who are mentally ill or addicted in the homeless population? Absolutely. Does that mean they don't deserve shelter? Definitely not. Note though that this current influx of homeless people is not due to an increase in mental illness or addiction -- it's because of the pandemic and the resulting unemployment and death and increased expenses. This means that more people who don't struggle with mental illness and addiction are experiencing homelessness than we see normally. This doesn't make them worthier of housing than our standard homeless population, but it should illustrate the scope of the problem, and maybe also speak to the commenter's concerns about who homeless people are and how they behave. It is currently much easier than it typically is to fall into homelessness. We are living in a crisis. Our response should reflect that. . . . Also, while there's no way to tell whether this was the commenter's intent, it is very common for people to make a big fuss about manufactured or imagined logistical roadblocks as a way of distracting from the real reason they don't want to share resources, which is that they believe that the group in need does not deserve them. It is also very common to ""other"" a group of people and talk about them as if they're sub-human or defective in some way as an excuse/tool to deny them shelter or commit violence against them, or as a way to make the denial/violence go down easier for the general public. Hardly anybody in this thread, or even anybody in the crosspost in the townie sub, seems to be actually interested in bringing this potential solution to the table to see what it would take. Instead, most of the posters are upset that anyone would ever suggest that we put homeless people (who everyone is calling dirty or insane or addicted or some other version of vile or unworthy) in the dorms that *belong to the public,* which everyone is claiming are the rightful property only of this superior institution and its superior pupils and that it must be protected from these undesirables at any cost. . . . Why don't we take a look at what's happening in this thread? It's really messed up. Guys, be better than this. I wasn't trying to be shitty in my other comment when I said that people who go to UofM are smart -- I mean it. Don't fall for this us-against-them bullshit, and don't forget that state resources belong to all of us. This thinking doesn't serve us.

This is because:. . . . 1. These people are less likely to be swamped with messages from salespeople, other job applicants, recruiters, etc. than people who are managers/senior people.. 2.

Other people to target outreach for are the relevant recruiting leads for the companies you are aiming for.

They are oftentimes either an engineer/PM/dev manager who is acting as the quasi-hiring manager for applicants from that school, or a recruiter who is acting as the lead recruiter for that school. This person is a key gatekeeper that I think people do not really think about. They are oftentimes not a super-senior person either (usually a mid-level or senior individual contributor or manager). They are tricky to find since a lot of them might not have this position in their job title, but they might have a LinkedIn post with them mentioning that they play the role.

Obviously this was not ideal and it did complicate move-in. However, I came to understand that this is not the fault of the co-op itself. Co-op living is super affordable because all chores and food prep is handled in-house. When a resident moves out of a co-op they are expected to clean their own room. So the **only** person responsible for cleaning out the room is the previous resident. This is because co-ops work as a closed system: everybody is expected to do their part. If someone does not do their part it is unfair to the rest of the house. Nobody is there to pick up slack in non-communal spaces (bedrooms) unless previously agreed upon.. . Now, what happens when someone doesn't do their part? Well- they get fined. Fining is generally a good punishment. It keeps people generally doing their jobs regularly. However, sometimes it is not as effective. This is because when someone doesn't do their expected chore and they get fined, the chore doesn't necessarily get done after that.. . In this case, the room was likely not cleaned very well. However, it doesn't sound like fining would have been effective here. Plus, the room was likely not dirty enough to fine someone.. . So- my main point is that I know firsthand how not ideal this is and I am sorry this is your first impression of a co-op. However, just thought I would point out that it is not like someone in the house neglected to do their job. Additionally, if this helps- I cleaned and repainted my room and it looks amazing! Plus, you can ask for new furniture if you would like as well! They will be able to get you dorm furniture. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions!. .

Now, that I have the grades to prove that I belong at UMich though, the pre-health advisors have become a lot more...helpful. There are a lot of research opportunities that you can apply to. I got into a lab my second semester at UMich. I would recommend walking around the school building to find those bulletin boards with different leaflets on them. To shadow someone though, you have to email a lab head, researcher, or healthcare professional individually. I actually had the opportunity to shadow a woman studying pancreatic cancer during my first semester. So, yes. There are opportunities but you have to find them. I would also recommend signing up for a CNA course at either WCC or through Heart to Heart healthcare in Ypsi. I am a licensed CNA now and I have seen a lot of pre-med students have their dreams crushed because the work environment and direct patient care wasn't for them. The opportunities are there.

Furthermore, ones that have seniority get more autonomy in what shifts they pick up, and can even take the holidays off and have other staff work shifts so the hospital isn't short of workers. Amazing revelation, right?. . Okay, now that the elementary-level of explanation is over, here's the fact: It's easier for everyone involved if the staff get their vaccine during their shift, than to come in on off-hours to receive it. Doing so would increase wait times for others to receive a vaccine, and they risk exposure waiting in line with no PPE (because off hours) for a vaccine. It's easier for them to get it at the beginning of their next shift, which is scheduled post-holidays because they have some seniority and could do that.. . Nobody is hoarding.

Furthermore, IAs are typically utilized in large classes, whereas peer mentors are in charge of a small number of people which whom they have more personal relationships (mandatory one-on-one meetings, more direct email communication, etc.).

It's going to take at least 5-6 months to get most adults vaccinated.. . There are roughly 290,000 adults in Washtenaw County and 37,700 doses have been shipped here in the past 3.5 weeks, according to the state's dashboard. So if you assume it takes, say, 70% adults vaccinated to get to herd immunity, that would be 400,000 doses needed. So we are a little less than 10% to that goal.. . Edit 1: Just to clarify, the 37,700 doses shipped is to the county, not U-M. U-M gets some portion of that (currently totaling about 20,000 doses according to Michigan Medicine's page).. . Edit 2: Guys, I understand there are caveats here like more vaccines possibly being approved and not everyone at U-M lives in Washtenaw County. My point is ""U-M is vaccinating 2000 people per day"" is a technically true headline but makes it sound like most faculty/staff/students are going to be fully vaccinated in the next month or two, which is *unlikely* given the rate at which vaccine doses are being manufactured/shipped. . . I'm not saying don't be optimistic; I'm saying don't be *irrationally* optimistic. It's taken 4 weeks to administer just the first dose for phase 1A (Michigan is transitioning to 1B next week), and 1A is the fewest number of people (I believe about 500,000 statewide). We have a long way to go.. . Edit 3: CNN is reporting this morning that the Biden admin is going to change how vaccine doses are distributed once taking office: instead of the federal government holding second doses in reserve for 3-4 weeks, they'll ship everything they have with the expectation that the next dose will be manufactured in time for people who need it.

I don't think there will be a lot of flat out mandates, but if schools and workplaces make a vaccine a requirement for full, in person participation, I think hesitant people will come around.

Most of their classmates will be in person, so the kids will beg to go back and join them. It's hard to work when your kids are home with you during the day.

I'm not saying you'll be punished at work - just saying that people who are there in person will get more face time with your bosses and more attention on their work.) . .

Like for example the space shuttle accidents. The official evaluation of risk for the space shuttles were like 1%. The reality was a order of magnitude different. . . The point of having all kinds of regulations is to prevent accidents. And it just happens the current vaccines haven't gone through all the trial phases. . . Is it ethically correct to force individuals do undergo procedures for short term gain when the long term effects are unknown? . .

I also have not had any issues with the landlord and she seems like a very nice person. My issues are the age of the building and the appliances. I feel like I call maintenance pretty often because of how often things break down and need to be replaced in my unit. The walls of this place are incredibly thin as well. If someone in the unit above me drops something, it's incredibly loud, and if they play a show or have a conversation, I can hear most of it well too. I can also hear every single step they take. This also applies to my neighbors who live next to me, I can hear what they're doing too. Additionally, this place literally smells like straight-up weed so unless that's your preferred scent of choice I'd keep that in mind. The smell also runs into my unit a lot from the bathroom vents so my bathroom and sometimes even my living room smells like it. Also, if there's more than one person in the kitchen neither of us can move around to do what we have to because it's small. Although I will not be staying here next school year I would live here again because the whole neighbor issue isn't a huge deal to be since I sleep through practically anything.

That said, my opinion is that this would be feasible but it would have to be almost entirely student driven in implementation (ie IA/GSI-driven by members or coaches of the current ICPC team); I don't know that the professors would fight very hard to get this course up if they knew it would be adding extra work for something they don't care about too much (the main comp programming professor left recently, there are probably 1-3 professors in EECS who pay attention to it at all now). The way it works at some other schools is that the professor is just officially on the roster or something but isn't much involved with the course (pretty close to how the ICPC team is run now lol).. . My personal opinion is that this shouldn't be a course, mainly because there will probably be mismatched expectations (people will go in hoping for a Leetcode prep course and will end up learning eg computational geometry stuff which they won't care about).

Michigan took me in with 34 credits (a semester workload is 16 credits), and the calculator in UIUC gave me 29 credits. 5 credits isn't much, but passing above that 32 mark meant I'd essentially cut down on a year's worth of OOS tuition, whereas in UIUC I'd have to have a couple more intense semesters if I wanted to graduate a year early. UIUC was slightly cheaper though.. . I'd summarize it as saying, if you are planning to study EECS, they are almost indistinguishable in terms of reputation, and you should look into other factors such as the campus environment, location, sports etc. UMich's name is slightly stronger in other fields that I was planning to major in, but I have friends studying in UIUC and UW-Madison who both say that they are quite happy (as happy as you can be during COVID), so you can't really go wrong with any of them.",2.0,neutral,0.7821895480155945

The way people went to parties, and the luxuries that many had (such as ordering things online, going out to eat or going to the movies) were alien to me. Not to mention how I didn't fit in culturally due to coming here from Guatemala.. . I also came from a family that subsisted around the poverty line, and where domestic abuse was a daily occurrence. I couldn't be out either because I was risking being beaten by my father and stepmother.. . Making friends was all but nigh impossible, before COVID, and more so now. The only friends I have are a great guy from a video game I usually play and Reddit. Other than that, I basically have zero genuine contact with anyone else. All the friends I had in New Jersey (where I did high school and undergrad), and Guatemala (where I did Pre-K to middle school) I've sadly lost to time. Just like you, when others were excited for break, I was dreading it. I didn't want to go back to my homophobic and transphobic family. I didn't want to go back to the daily arguments. I didn't want to go back to people who think are doing the best for me when in reality they can't even respect who I am as a human being. I didn't want to go back to hell on Earth.. . Fortunately, undergrad helped me build confidence in myself and made me realize that what I called ""life"" back then really wasn't the way it had to be. I felt that after graduation, I could finally make a difference. Even though I got depression 2 years ago, I'm still glad I made it, despite having to fight through it every day since. Despite that, my former self wouldn't have been able to write this post due to being too scared of how others would think and/or that I was incredibly stupid and that my opinions didn't amount to anything.. . Again, thank you for writing this post. Being a first generation student is difficult enough, but having so many other problems on top of this is incredibly difficult to imagine.",27.0,error,0.0

But I was expressing to my friend that I was worried this might be something that keeps coming up as I apply for engineering jobs in the future, even though my current internship knows about my past and is very accepting. His advice was based off being in the military, he thought somebody who'd had a ""kink in their chain"" and worked through struggles might be a better choice for a job than somebody who had the perfect everything, every advantage, because who knows how that person will respond under pressure, will they fold?

Firstly, most California schools in the CAL or UC system have really specific transfer requirements where you more or less need your associates done and you need credits living in specific categories ( like 6 credits of English whatever). That's pretty unique to California.. Michigan (and a lot of other institutions) won't have those same specific standards.. I know people who transferred here from another 4 year school in their first year of college. . . Second, I'd say Michigan is fairly friendly to community college transfers. What I mean by that is since so many majors/ programs here really start as a junior (Architecture, public health, school of information) all for example, you have higher odds of still graduating in 4 semesters. Compared to other colleges where strong core in major classes start first year and then when you transfer they make you do their core so you tack on another year or more.. This isn't to say your transfer process will be seamless, you may still have to send documentation and fight a little to get some stuff transferred over.

I believe after we made some changes, wait times generally were about 2 hours at peak times. Not short, but pretty much in line with what we had in person. Reducing them further would require either reducing the amount of time per person (which I imagine is not something students want) or hiring more IAs (which kind of goes against your request of having more stringent guidelines for staff). Another thing: why did you think you had to check Google meet every few minutes? When you get to the top of the queue, you should get a browser notification. . . 2: not much to comment on here.

We did push back deadlines as much as we could without overlapping with other projects/exam studying time. . . 3: I recognize that you don't want to share specifics, but these are the types of things that can help us improve the class the most. With regards to lectures: it's easy to miss things, every time students point out corrections, it's very helpful. Grading: with the number of problems we have to grade (over 900, multiplied by 2 because there are 2 problems to grade), it's inevitable that things slip through. We rely on regrade requests to catch these, although we hope to avoid them of course. What kind of issues did you have with regrades? . . Rubrics: we had one pretty bad rubric this semester, but the other ones we all felt fit our standards. Did you have issues with the other ones? What do you think we could do to improve them? . . Staff hiring: I don't have any input on staff hiring, but I can promise that making it even harder to be an IA would not fix anything, especially if it reduced the number of IAs. . . . 4: as a staff, we try to make sure we don't perpetuate this, although we aren't always successful.

In my opinion, Michigan CS has put much more effort into making computer science as accessible as possible to as many students as possible. For example, simply look at the requirements to declare as a CS major. Our GPA requirement for EECS 280 and 203 are uncharacteristically low compared to other top CS programs. Berkeley, another top public CS school, requires something like an A- average through their respective intro classes to declare as CS. And I think this is what largely causes your first complaint on office hours. Because our school is much less selective in who declares CS, there is more overcrowding in the core CS courses. Would you want 203 and 280 to be graded harsher, or have the cutoff GPA requirements raised? That's how other schools address overcrowding. What other suggestions do you have to address this? Additionally, Im not sure how ubiquitous your thoughts on 281 are among students. From the course evals, ATLAS ratings, as well as my anecdotal evidence, it seems like a majority of students that go through 281 would not agree with you.

If other universities are worse, that just means that they've failed to an even greater degree.. . I got into the curve on some comments, but the post itself is about late days. These are policy concerns that have nothing to do with grading. I have my opinions on EECS 280 and 203 (203 especially), but if I went into all my issues with those classes the post would be miles long. Moreover, I shouldn't be banned from criticizing something just because I haven't offered a solution. My concerns about office hours overcrowding don't become invalid just because you pointed out a cause. In fact, because you pointed out a cause, it points to more overarching issues. If office hours are overcrowded, why hasn't the university hired more professional staff? It certainly has the capital to, and IAs are not enough, as we have seen. Why do so many students need office hours in the first place? These are just a few questions that could be raised.. . I am also interested in why you think my opinions aren't that prevalent. All of the CS students I've spoken with agree with me. The only place I've encountered any disagreement is from EECS boys who spend all their time on reddit, basically, which seems like a huge sampling bias. Course evals and anecdotal evidence also have a huge sampling bias. Course evals take a long time to write, especially if someone has a lot of issues with the class they're in, and combined with the fact that they're probably also struggling in the same class means that they don't get turned in on time. Anecdotal evidence depends on 1. who you interact with and 2. who you meet. This may come as a shock to you, but many people involved in CS hate the environment of the EECS department and avoid interaction with ""EECSholes"" as much as possible. ATLAS ratings, in addition to having all the sampling bias that course evals have, are quantitative measurements. I wanted to take the class, I learned a lot, and I knew what was expected of me; I still hated the class because it was structurally frustrating and inflexible and destroyed my mental health. The numbers tell you nothing.. . Anyway, I didn't apply to UMich to do CS, and I'm not singly dedicated to it like so many other CS majors.

It sounds like he's already taken at least 2 of the 4 prerequisites (106 & 110/183). You haven't mentioned if he's taken STATS250 or 1st year writing course, so I would make sure he takes those two next semester to be eligible for applying.. . \- Presumably, he'll have two more courses left (assuming he's taking STATS250 + 1st year writing course this next semester) -- I would fill those up with CS requirements so he'd stay on track for CS if he doesn't get into BSI.. . \- IF he has already taken STATS250 and 1st year writing course, then I would just take mostly CS-requirement courses for the next semester, since he's knocked the prereqs out of the way. There's not much use in doing more than the BSI required prereqs, because if BSI doesn't work out, BSI classes are pretty specialized and probably won't be useful for his CS degree as his fallback option. The credits will kind of go to waste (in terms of fulfilling requirements, but they could be intellectually interesting courses to take as e.g. electives). . \--------------. . As for core classes:. . \- Looks like 1 has changed when I took it, but you should expect to take the core classes within the 1st semester after being admitted into the BSI. The core classes are 206, 310, 339.. and 300 (internship studio). Not sure what's going on with the internship studio right now but if he gets in, the advisors will advise you on if/when to take that.. . \- During your second semester (junior year second semester) in the BSI, I'd try to get your requirements out of the way as quickly as possible (while maintaining a manageable-ish workload). As far as I understand, there's no requirements as to when you need to take what - other than, the capstone course in your last semester prior to graduation (I believe this one is only hosted in the winter).. . \- For your second semester (junior year second semester), I would take 301, 330, and MAYBE 425 (depends on how well you can handle multiple technical courses. If not well, maybe consider taking this course the following semester). I would fill the rest of your courses up with electives. \*\*Note, one hack that was HUGE for me was that I wised up and took graduate-level classes when I was in the BSI for my electives. I've found grad professors to be generally more chill and it makes for a good networking opportunity to be with people other than the ones in your BSI cohort. I was advised multiple times not to do it but I'm glad I listened to my gut because this was one of the best decisions I made during undergrad.. . \- For the semester following (your 3rd semester in the BSI), I would take 370 (since 330 is the prereq) and 425 if it's too much to handle in your second semester.. . \- 405 will be taken 1st semester of senior year and 485 will be taken last semester of senior year.. .

The 2nd reason is u of m has an out of state population of 50% with a fair amount of students coming from California, Texas florida and new york i.e. the covid danger zones. With rollouts being different across county and state lines and shortages theres no guarantee the out of state students will not be a vector.. . 3rd reason is with a new strain arriving in the u.s. there's not enough data to say the vaccine will work on this new strain. Similarly to the flu, there are many different strains and flu vaccines are very strain specific. If this is the case for the new strain of covid another vaccine will need to be created.. . 4. Vaccines are not enough. In addition to vaccines there needs to be more therapies for covid. Yes vaccines are supposed to be a preventative measure however, there's not enough data to state the long term efficacy of the vaccine or if it prevents reinfection.. .

I studied one specific industry at Michigan for undergrad, worked in it for a year, and realized it wasn't for me. However because my studies and previous experiences were for me, I was extremely limited in my opportunities to leave that industry. The MM program provided me with a phenomenal and well rounded business education which helped me receive jobs offers which I never would have without it. . . Just having Ross connected to your name and resume opens doors for you. That's not to mention the opportunities that Ross' career development office provides you. I used the LSA career office all the time as an undergrad and it still didn't come close to Ross' in terms of coaching me, guiding me, and helping open doors for me. . . No the program isn't an MBA program, but I still took several MBA classes as electives. On top of that I graduated with a Master degree from a top tier, world renowned business school at the age of 24. Most MBA students at Ross and other programs of that caliber are at least 25 with 3-5 years of work experience before they even start their program. This isn't to say that the MM program is just as good or better than Ross' MBA. My point is they aren't a good comparison because they're for much different types of people. One is for undergrad's with minimal previous business school exposure, the other is for established professionals who already have years of work experience. The MM program doesn't prevent you from returning to get your MBA later on either. I know of two alumni in particular who were able to get into top MBA programs (Kellogg and Wharton) a few years after graduating from MM. Their one year at Ross transferred as credits for those MBA programs and saved them a year of MBA tuition as well. . . I don't know why the other comments are so negative, or if these people went through the program themselves and unfortunately had a bad time with it. I can firmly say that that is not the case for everyone, or even the majority of alumni and students of the program. The Ross MM is ranked as the best MM program in the country for a reason. If you're considering it then I highly recommend speaking with the admissions staff and current students on LinkedIn to get their thoughts.",6.0,positive,0.5494198203086853

I can tell you what I know about them since I have a bunch of friends involved in pre-professional greek life! These are by no means comprehensive, and I will obviously be influenced by my personal biases. No pre-professional frat has an official house, except for the chem frat but I'm pretty sure they got kicked out. Their main selling points are professional development opportunities, networking, and, of course, making friends! All of them have a social aspect, although that differs amongst them.. . DGPhi is the only pre-law sorority, so it is comprised solely of female-identifying students. If you're also female-identifying and are looking for a safe space to bond with other pre-law students, I imagine this is the one for you!. . Kapi is known for being the most competitive and cutthroat of the three pre-law fraternities. They are notoriously known for their callous and even antagonistic culture and their process is (to my knowledge) extremely selective as they are one of the older and more established pre-law fraternities. If you are a competitive person and are considering the pre-law track, definitely consider applying here! However, you can apply to/rush multiple frats at the same time.. . KOA is referred to as Kapi's rejects by some, but they are also a well-established group and are not known to be as aggressive as Kapi. Again, join if you're looking for a strictly pre-law organization.. . BAR (formerly associated with PAD) is generally known as the ""nice"" or ""fun"" pre-law frat. Although their process is still competitive, they are also a public service fraternity and have a less cutthroat culture than most of the other pre-law orgs. . .

I graduated in winter 2020 so I only got a couple of months of virtual learning and teaching. Since the virtual format was brand new last winter, none of the professors asked for us to have our video on and I definitely took advantage of that and just did other stuff during class and paid zero attention because no one could see what I was doing. I also taught that semester as a GSI and found it super hard to engage with my students even though it was a small discussion format class. Not being able to see each other was discouraging for both the instructor and student. Now I work entirely remotely for my job, we are asked to use our video and I think it has more pros than cons. I find myself paying attention, enjoying seeing my coworkers, and it's a little bit of a morale booster. One of my coworker's complaints about using video is that she always ends up just staring at herself and it makes her feel like she's in a lonely void.

So just do this: file your taxes (even if you can't pay anything), pay what you can by April 15 (they're not late until April 16 even if you filed earlier than that, i.e. you can pay later than you file), and then call the IRS at 800-829-1040 and politely state you can't afford to pay $X amount on your tax bill and you'd like to see what your options are.

But yes, you will need to file a tax return with the federal government and the Michigan government. The good news is the money you have seen disappear from your paycheck is called a ""withholding""; it is basically estimated taxes and is typically a bit more than your actual taxes will be. This means you may actually get money back from the government after you file your return!. . Hardly anyone in the US actually fills out a 1040 return by hand, usually people either use software that does it by asking you a series of easy-to-understand questions (eg Turbotax) or hiring a tax preparer (eg H&R Block). Unless you have lots of investments or run a business there is probably no need to hire a tax preparer. . . The forms you will definitely need are your UM W2 (a W2 is generated from any entity that paid you wages) and the 1098-T (documenting educational expenses), both of which you can get from Wolverine Access. If you had an internship or part time job, you'll need to get the W2 from your employer. Forgetting to list income or investments greatly increases your chances of being audited and maybe fined.. . All that having been said, doing your own taxes takes maybe 60-90 minutes with TurboTax and isn't an unpleasant process.

The surveillance state could've stepped in to stop those people (just as they continually crushed BLM protestors last summer) but they didn't because there wasn't any serious threat to power and the state knew it could use the resulting hysteria to strengthen its power. The same liberals who were saying ACAB last summer are now singing praise to the FBI.. . > But we should absolutely divert resources away from other parts of the criminal justice system. . Sure I think it'd be cool as hell if the FBI wasted all their resources on arresting the Jan 6 buffoons but they don't have any interest in actually stopping reactionaries no matter how much we wish they did. The agency that assassinated Fred Hampton is not suddenly going to stop trying to crush the working class no matter how many FBI tips you call in. . . However, as ""leftists"" turn to support the FBI, liberals will use that support to pass new laws (even if you don't agree with these laws) that expand the surveillance state. Historically we know that the state will primarily use this power to stomp on the working class though.",0.0,negative,0.6434454321861267

CSE's position is that it is okay for Jason to stay, because technically he wasn't acting in his role as a professor when he did those things and there were no complaints from university students about him. You know why there were no complaints? Because his grad student (who was also his startup employee) emailed the department chair to talk about Jason's harassment, and then after that decided not to file a report. You know who the department chair was at that time? **Peter Chen.** During the CSE town hall, the interim chair told concerned students that Jason could continue to teach because allegations are not the same as facts and Jason was innocent until proven guilty. That interim chair? **Peter Chen.** Jason's student dropped out of the PhD program.. . The OIE investigation into [the allegations](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/education/2020/02/07/students-faculty-slam-university-michigan-over-sex-misconduct-cases/4682792002/) against Walter Lasecki resulted in a ""no finding"" outcome, meaning there wasn't enough evidence to decide either way, as is usually the case in these things. In the meantime, his grad students bailed but struggled to find other advisors and funding, and CSE did not help them during the transition period. After finding out about the report, Walter revoked one victim's access to their computing accounts for research. Additionally, CSE did not work with that student and Lasecki to arrange a schedule to ensure that the student could safely access the CSE building to complete their research. The large body of undergrad researchers and students in Walter's class were not informed at all. CSE failed to protect its students.. . **And after all that, both Jason Mars and Walter Lasecki are still professors in CSE.** They still publish papers, still get their professor salary ($125,500 and $124,000 base salary respectively), and can still supervise any poor student who doesn't find out about their background in time.

I also got like a C on the first exam.. . Eventually I started to get the hang of it though and started becoming more excited since I was finally putting the dots together.

I know it's not the same case for everyone, but it could just be that there's a steep learning curve for coding at first that you have to overcome since it is a pretty new and unfamiliar concept for people just getting into it for the first time.. . My point in sharing the grades I got is not to flaunt that ""wow, I'm so smart, I got an A in 183 and 280,"" but rather to show that how you finish is not dictated by how you start. This may not be a one-size-fits-all situation, but I would recommend sticking with the course and keep giving your best despite setbacks as you may overcome the learning curve as well.
