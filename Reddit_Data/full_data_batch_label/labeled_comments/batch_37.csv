The homeworks are manageable but long (my submissions tended to be anywhere from 3 to 8 pages long). But the main complaint I had was the exams. In my opinion they were brutal and unforgiving. More than once I would write a whole page worth of an answer for a question and then get 0 points for it. Doing good on the homework did not seem to be an indicator of preparedness either. I did above average with high 80s and low 90s for nearly all the homework and yet would still have to spend hours stewing over practice exams because just doing the homework well wasn't nearly enough. . . . My advice (what worked for me); find a group to compare hw answers with and study with, this helped me a ton. Don't waste time with problem roulette, a lot of the questions on there cover material that is no longer tested on. Ace the weekly check ins, they are easy and worth 10% of your overall grade which can help a ton towards the end of the semester. Lastly, study for the exams. Even if you feel like you know the material, use the practice exams since they are the closest to the real thing and time yourself.

t1_j182c6s,2022-12-22 10:19:03,t3_zr8jee,t3_zr8jee,"I just took this class last semester!. . In general: Definitely never fall behind in this class and stay on top of your stuff. There are four exams, and none of them are *directly* cumulative, but they mostly build off of each other. The first exam covers fundamentals that you will have to memorize and remember for the rest of the course, and then the third exam content ties into the fourth exam content really closely and the content there is still directly tested on the final even though ""none of the exams are technically cumulative"".. . For your textbook: The textbook for our semester was Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry 7th Edition. The reason they may not have mentioned it is they might be shifting it to the 8th Edition, but I'm not sure. I just know that they talked about how one of the images wasn't accurate. (I ended up not getting the textbook since all material you need to know is covered in class, but I'm sure it could be helpful since they do mention it several times in their study guides.). . \---. . For your study habits: I got an A by really focusing on two things: **Memorizing** and **Knowing what I don't know**. . You're offered an entire double-sided sheet of paper for notes to bring into each exam, and you can write really small on it. This is a massive lifesaver and can provide you with a lot of info on exams. Despite that, there's so much content that most people can't fit everything on the sheet and then find relevant information and answer exam questions quickly enough, so you do need to memorize a lot of info as well.. . To memorize as much as I could, the most important part of my process would be to watch every Lecture Recording, play it at 1x speed, and pause it very frequently to take notes on literally every single slide. Everything on the slides and everything they talk about, unless they explicitly mention otherwise, is fair game for being tested on. The instant you finish one concept, mentally quiz yourself on the entire molecule/process/system/etc. until you memorize it, then continue the lecture recording. That really helps to consolidate your memory on topics. It usually took me about 6-7 hours per lecture recording to go through the first round, and then additional time to review specific material in depth which depended on the topic.. . Later, I would go through the ""Need to Know"" pages (study guides), and look for anything I didn't fully understand, and what parts of it I didn't understand. I'd categorize my page into parts by chapter and then take notes on what I did not know for each topic on the ""Need to Know"" page. For my first two exams, I did not use the ""Need to Know"" pages and suffered for it. Literally walked into the exam with large letters on only one side of my page for Exam 2 because I didn't know what I didn't know.. . That being said if you work better in a group setting you can sign up for SLC Learning Groups I believe. I didn't bother since my friends told me it didn't help them, and I learn better on my own; I can't tell you how helpful SLC is since I just don't know.. . \--. . Extra tip: The discussion section should be free points. In your discussion sections, ask your GSI questions on the discussion question before submitting it; my GSI and all her subs were very accommodating since their goal is to get you to understand the knowledge behind the question.. . Most projects are pretty easy since you can ask your instructor for help with the answers, except for the Metabolic Map project. For that, I'd get started on that as you learn content; it helps. When you learn about the shuttle systems and are a bit confused about how they tie together, ask a professor or GSI for help and they might be able to tie it together really cleanly for you.",6.0,error,0.0

As someone who got top 4% of the grade in the class, here are some of my advice.. . My first tip is don't stress! It's a class that requires you to be calm, to think, and to be willing to take risks (e.g. rewrite your code, know when getting a 98.63 on a project is enough and it's time to study for an exam).. . * Projects (40% of grade). * Make sure you're organized and you're able to think clearly. This means finding an environment, having a good desk setup, access to white board, all ahead of time so you can stay consistent throughout the semester.. * When in doubt, look things up. This means Googling concepts or C++ features or referring back to class notes from 280/281.. * Create a directory called ""EECS281Sandbox"". I would use this for learning C++ features or when I debugged (hmm I wonder why is it causing this behavior, type it in, and walk through the examples line by line and see how data is being transformed).. * While projects typically differ from semester to semester, it follows some sort of pattern. * Project 1 - Depth-First Search (Stack), Breadth-First Search (Queue). If you just follow all the advice outlined in Dr. P's video, it's sufficient to get 100. Get started as early as you can (aka finish Project 0 and walkthrough tutorials).. * Project 2 - some modification of searching algorithm, Priority Queues/Comparators, and then dealing with pointers in [P2B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqPJF2L5h9U&ab_channel=AbdulBari). P2B has three parts. The first two parts is about 100 lines of code because you can copy the code given in the lecture. The last part is building a pairing heap, and there's no need to read the research paper unless you want to. [Follow everything in this guide](https://ajzhou.gitlab.io/eecs281/notes/chapter10/). I rewrote P2A multiple times here actually, and it taught me a lot about coding. Please try to get this project done at least a few days early so you are not stressed studying for the midterm.. * Project 3 - hash tables and a whole lot of functors, plus switch statements/some templated programming. This project teaches you about tradeoffs. Hash tables are almighty, but is it always right to use them? How do you iterate over them? How do you use STL functions with it? And when is it better to use vectors vs. hash tables. Make sure you settle on a good design (again, watch the walkthrough) before writing code. It's a project where you can get to 90 in 1 day, but spend the next 10 days getting to 100. If you spend 2 days planning and 3 days getting to 100, you'll still save 5 days :). * Project 4 - MST algorithms (part A is themed, part B is using a heuristic, and part C is optimal traveling salesman person problem). Just watch the walkthrough. In this project, how you represent your data will be important. Also, don't get too stuck on part B choosing the **perfect** heuristic. Most things you land you a 99.8 or 99.9 range, and that's when you should start studying for the final, which is worth 2x as much as this project. This project is the shortest and the easiest to complete on time, which means you should finish P4, turn in Lab 10, and go study for the final right away.. * Watch all the lectures, **labs**, and project walkthroughs before you start the project. * **Read the spec the day it comes out**. * Write down **all** of your ideas on a doc (Google Docs, Notability, etc.). It also means reading the spec (ideally on paper), highlighting important parts, and start writing down targeted test cases and their expected output ahead of time. For example, in the SillyQL project this semester, people were asked to build a small database in C++ with support for numerous querying features, one of which is print where when there's a hash index. In this case, you'll create a test case by populating the table, creating a hash index, and print where {<, >, =}. See how I am not writing a test case to test the entire kitchen sink, but just print where + hash index behavior? You should only use the long test cases to verify the entire program's behavior, not to test your way out of failed test on the autograder.. * Go to OH, sit there and listen. Modify and adapt your design. Get feedback and ask Dr. P questions.. * I would start handwriting my code, and critiquing my design along the way. Most importantly, you should follow the advice Dr. P gives. * Only OOP (inheritance + polymorphism concepts) used is in P2, the rest I didn't use too much and got 100. * Difficulty (based on personal statistics). * Project 1 (700 lines, 12 days) >> Project 2 (800 total lines, 6 days) > Project 3 (800 lines, 3 days) > Project 4 (600 lines, 1 day). * Projects decrease in difficulty imo, this means your work is **front-loaded**. * P1 has the highest time/memory constraints, P3 has the worst memory constraints. * P1 is also an adjustment period, so give yourself the freedom to write, rewrite, and ask a lot of questions",20.0,error,0.0
t1_j1bntem,2022-12-23 02:43:28,t1_j1bns45,t3_zst931,"* Exams (40% of grade). * Very overhyped in this class. You can honestly do extremely well on the exam if you put in a little work to study. * Find a study group of 6-10 people at the beginning of the semester. Each week, go over. * The lecture content, condense it down into big ideas (critical for MC). * The lab content, particularly quizzes after answers are released and handwritten problems. I believe the lab itself is still partner-based. Treat it like a project, write out ideas ahead of time. There are lab content that comes up all the time in both exams and **interviews**, so you should really prioritize and not skip them. If you don't like going in person (like me), at least watch the [labs on EECS 281's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EfielUqIa4&list=PLmotwOE2mfH6NIO9AhKBlp-PaAK3yQYX5&ab_channel=EECS281).. * Write down the things you learned from projects.. * Do the practice exams individually, then go over the answers together and discuss approaches. This is the most important step that led all of my friends to score 90+ on both exams.. * [Lab 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVvrAHJtwnY&ab_channel=AndrewZhou), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU6udHRIkcc&ab_channel=AbdulBari), 7, 10 are the most time consuming and easy to mess up. Definitely start those ASAP. (20% of grade for Labs 1-10). * Multiple Choice. * 24 Questions, I budgeted about 45 minutes. * Do all of questions and **read through the solutions (how they arrived at the answers)**. * Remember the condense cheat sheets you made and all the lab questions you did? Ok this is where it's helpful. Have the notes/cheat sheets in front of you, and modify it as you learn things from the MC.. * FRQ. * The key here is to realize what patterns they might potentially test (only 3-4 per exam). For the midterm, it's stacks/queues (FIFO, LIFO, do you see data somehow shrinking in between, if so this is the right time to use it), some sort of iterating through templated data structure from the STL (lots of ++, --, \*), and do you know how/when to use heaps and write comparators (hint: if you see the word min/max/extreme, it's time to use a heap, or if you see log n time complexity). For the final, dynamic programming {1D, 2D, 3D, etc.} is a guaranteed question, and it varies between graphs/trees, which essentially boils down to writing DFS/BFS with some variation. It really isn't bad to study for.. * For DP, it tends to scare many people, and it definitely scared me. There's ""mercy"" points. DP is \~20 points, but declaring a memo table, populating it, iterating through, and return the right element gets you like 6/20 points. The rest of the 14 is like finding the base case/recurrence relation. Again this comes with practice. This is where LC becomes very helpful. Checkout [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io) for some sick DP tutorials.. * Can DM me for a study guide (midterm + final)",7.0,error,0.0

Write a ""in\_bounds"" function, and given any x and y, it immediately tells you if it's inbounds. It's like 4 lines of code. . 2. What if you can represent the four directions not just as a sequence of variable memory access + offset, but as some kind of array. Example 'int directions[4][2] = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}}'. Now, you can just iterate through the array, for all directions check if in bounds, do something with it, and add to your data structure. You essentially slash the # of lines by 4.. . EECS 281 is a very grindy class. I personally never coded before coming into college, and I put in about 20-30 hours a week rigorously studying for the class. Was it worth it? Absolutely. You will not only get a high grade (and be very happy about it), but this class preps you for technical interview questions like no other (well maybe EECS 491).. . . Make sure to take breaks in between. Taking it in winter is actually a huge advantage because you have spring break. Try to not work during that time and let your mind unwind. . . I probably told you tips you ""already knew"" but the most cliche tips are the most helpful. Don't overthink the class. Keep calm, and get an A in 281!. . . Finally, if you're thinking about how to succeed this early, you will. Respect the time the class deserves, and I wish you success :)",10.0,error,0.0

That means that the professors do believe that you did enough to show competence and move forward with the computer science curriculum. Not to mention, that you got an A average on the projects which is no small feat! IMO exams, especially ones where you have to write code with pencil and paper, aren't as good as a measure of your computer science ability. They need some way to test you, but it doesn't really well translate to real-world programming with how you can just Google everything. . . 281 is not an easy class. It's a big step up from 280, and depending on what upper levels you take, it could very well be the hardest CS class you take at Michigan. There are definitely harder classes (such as 482) that can continue to push you, but in general, I feel like the difficulty of the CS program starts to plateau after 281. The other thing is that when there's a big increase in difficulty between classes, not everyone can excel on the first try because people learn different things at different rates. One of my 281 IAs didn't do well in the class himself but was able to pick up the skills later and well, was able to be competent enough to be an IA while he was still a student. . . Also, GPA is honestly pretty overrated. Most employers don't care nearly as much as you think, especially once you graduate. Grad schools care to an extent, but less so for PhDs and it can be made up in other ways, especially if you have strong research experience or choose to spend time in industry first. It can be easy to forget that Michigan Computer Science is a very good, yet tough program, so just being able to get through it means a lot to companies. I've had friends with lower GPAs (even below 3) that still ended up working at great tech companies and are super happy with their lives now. . . So congrats on passing the class! That's definitely something not everyone can do. And please don't be deterred by your grades, every successful person faces setbacks.

I was lucky to have mine covered and got it done at Ann Arbor Center for the Family.

UI Urbana-Champaign: A very well regarded program with a very nice college town. Be warned, I know out of state UI UC students that were convinced they'd make it out to Chicago all the time but Urbana-Champaign is pretty far from Chicago and it's hard to get out to the city. Trains and buses to Chicago are harder to get than you might think.. . UT Austin- if being in a major city is important to you this is your best bet. UT Austin is a peer to UM Ann Arbor in a lot of ways and the city of Austin is vibrant, growing and increasingly important. . . UM Ann Arbor- the academics are top tier and Ann Arbor is a vibrant city with incredible cultural and intellectual offerings.

This is my experience: I started with Nagorny and found out his explanations weren't entirely clear to me, so I switched to Soellner. I then found out Soellner used a flipped-classroom format (where you learn content before lecture and do practice in lecture). But, I didn't like his pre-lecture videos very much, so I just started reading the textbook. I also tried SLC study groups. I didn't like their pace, so I stopped going. I ended up settling for reading the textbook and doing chapter practice problems (~5hrs/week) before going to Soellner's lectures (3hrs/week). The most important part of this is to find an efficient yet reliable way for you to accurately learn the concepts. Try to minimize the use of online sources; they can be inconsistent with 210. The worst thing that can happen is if you learn an inaccurate shortcut and drill it into your head.. . . For exam prep, I did exam practice problems a day or two before the exam, usually with a friend (~12hrs). I cannot stress this enough: you HAVE to practice for 210. They do not assign you hw, and I think the biggest pitfall is if you think you can do well on exams just by going to lecture. 210 is mostly problem-solving and applying the concepts to broader contexts. Learning the concepts is actually pretty easy, but knowing how to accurately apply them to exam style questions is the real killer. Practice, practice, practice.. . Disclaimer: this is what worked for me, someone who liked orgo, was aiming for an A, and struggled to stay awake 5 min into lecture. I know plenty who liked SLC study groups and others who didn't read a page of the textbook. Ik this is cliche, but 210 gives you a lot of resources, and it will ultimately depend on you to figure out what works best for you. It's a great opportunity to learn, but can also be a very stressful experience if you don't. Regardless, don't forget to practice, and gl!",8.0,neutral,0.7224268317222595

I found it really helpful - it was probably why I got a good grade, to be honest. sometimes it can be a little difficult to digest and I'll admit it does take a long time (it's hard for me to concentrate for long periods of time so it would usually take me like 4 hrs to read one section lol), but in the long run it really helped me understand a lot of stuff. when going to office hours I found that some questions that were asked by other ppl was something covered in the book. (would def recommend reading the section before lecture, but I did slack on this and did fine so honestly it's up to your level of self-discipline) basically, the book has the ins and outs of the content, so you can get a stronger understanding in comparison to the lecture (since you can only really say so much in 50min). . 2. PRACTICE PROBLEMS! second-most important thing. orgo is all about application of knowledge, and some stuff gets really tricky sometimes - it's important to know how concepts appear in different scenarios. there's a shit ton in the book (I literally did not get through all of them, even though I grinded through a lot).. . 3. going to lecture/office hours: putting these in the same category because they had the same level of importance to me. coppola did a good job of summarizing a whole section and it usually cleared up some confusing bits from the book. office hours are also rly helpful for clearing up funky stuff that you don't understand (I went to prof office hours and not GSI office hours, but it's up to you). . . 4. slc study group: I liked my study group because I could ask other ppl about questions and not just my friends, and you can also ask the group facilitator questions. thought this was helpful bc the group facilitator is also an undergrad, so it was less intimidating imo. another good thing is that you're forced to do practice questions with other ppl so it goes w my point about practice q's!. . something else I wanna add is that it really helps to have a study partner. my friend and I would get together and go through practice exams the weekend before the exam, and we kept each other accountable while also keeping up morale lol (it gets rough).. . I can't really put a certain number of time on how much I studied, it was just ""read this section"" and ""do these practice problems if you have time"" kind of thing. expect to dedicate a lot of time to orgo though - my bereals were full of orgo this semester lol. . tldr: read textbook, do many many many practice problem, and go to class. also have some friends to study with if you can!",4.0,error,0.0

Basically every controls course is cross-listed between AE/ME/Rob/EE. The few that aren't cross-listed you can probably take as your out-of-department credits. I haven't looked closely at the courses offered in the Robotics program, but I'd imagine the vast majority of them are going to be cross-listed between other departments considering that the Robotics department didn't even have fully dedicated faculty until a couple years ago.. . One practical difference would be things like research-for-credit I suppose? I am not sure whether or not you need to do that within your own department, but that might be a requirement. Although this is not really a concern if you don't plan on doing research-for-credit. This is more a concern for PhD students, since the department their advisor belongs to is likely to dictate the subject of their research. Even with that said though, there are plenty of Profs in the AE department working on what would be considered ""robotics"" and on applications that have nothing to do with aerospace engineering (e.g., autonomous driving). But you are obviously more likely to find this kind of research in the robotics department. . . In effect though, the first thing employers will see on your resume is going to be either ""Robotics"" or ""Aerospace Engineering"". So, just for appearances' sake, you should probably choose the one that fits closer to your desired industry.. . There are probably some minor differences that would be forced upon you that I am not aware of since I did not do my Masters here (I'm a PhD student). But my point is that whichever you choose is likely not going to have a *huge* effect on what you study during your Masters. Choose whichever sounds like it might fit your interests more, but don't worry too much about it.. . EDIT: Also, I want to clarify my point that ""you can probably graduate from either program while taking the exact same set of courses"". ~~While this is true~~, it's also true that there are going to be *some* courses that are probably exclusive to either department. For example, there's a spacecraft mission design course in the AE department taught by Prof. Cutler that (I would imagine but IDK for sure) is probably exclusive to AE students. But my point is that these exclusive courses are going to be the minority of your selection.. . I also did a quick look and it seems like ROB 501, 502, and 550 have reserved seating for ROB students and it seems like these 3 courses are mandatory in the ROB program - so it seems like my earlier claim was incorrect. The AE department has no specific required courses IIRC, just a very flexible ""you gotta choose at least X courses from these lists"" kinda thing. So that's gunna be one of the differences as well. In the end, 95% of your Masters is just gunna be showing up for courses.

UMich is great, but as people have said UT is right in the city of Austin so there's much more to do. Austin is an extremely beautiful city with tons of nature. The other Texas cities are close too. San Antonio is an hour away and Houston and Dallas are 4 hours. . . Culturally, Spanish will be pretty prevalent and there's a ton of Mexican influence. Also THE FOOD!!!! Austin has some of the best food in the US imo, with amazing bbq and tex mex (I waited 2 hours in the sun for La Barbecue, got sun burnt and I'd still go back). If you're 21+ check out 6th street since it's an amazing nightlife spot. . Michigan is a beautiful state but if you go during the school year I'm not sure it's the best choice. Summer in Michigan is the best since it's not too hot and there's a lot of things to do. Winter shuts down a lot of activities but if you're interested in winter stuff, like skiing, ice skating, etc. then it'll be a good option. The fall also is beautiful with the changing leaves and activities like apple picking. Food on campus is pretty good but imo can't match the wide variety a major city like Austin has.. . Michigan does give you access to Detroit (1 hour and a bus available), Canada (like Toronto or Niagara Falls, both about 4 hours) and Chicago (5 hour train). Downside of Texas is public transit is almost nonexistent so it'll be hard to travel out of Austin without a car while getting to major nearby city from Ann Arbor is not bad.. . The weather in Texas will be extremely hot in the summer (talking 110+ F for days straight) but on the other hand, Michigan will be extremely cold (-10 F w/ wind at least if not colder) so take your pick. . .

Michigan is ungodly expensive out of state and actual USNews ranking is entirely irrelevant--what matters is the tier of school.

Also a terrible idea. Your odds of getting in from Michigan aren't a lot higher than your odds of getting in from a California community college. Michigan charges 10x the tuition. It's suspicious to employers when a student has attended three separate undergraduate institutions. Any reputable school will expect you to take 60+ credits at their institution to graduate from their institution, and Michigan generally expects transfer applicants to have 45+ credits before applying/transferring so that they can genuinely evaluate a substantial amount of college coursework. So you'd spend five to six years in school trying to get a single degree--45 credits at a CC, however many credits at Michigan (more than 15; nobody is going to accept a transfer student who does not have 15-30+ credits of grades to provide) and then another 60 at a college in California.. . Such a terrible idea. That is my conclusion and opinion. . . If you get substantial financial aid, which is awfully unlikely as an out-of-state transfer applicant, you can disregard the above.

There is also a huge nature sanctuary that students call ""the arb"", and it's a great place to be if you like to spend time out in nature. There is a pretty good social scene with a lot to do during the day as well as at night if that's your thing. The winters here can be pretty cold and long, so you'll need lots of warm clothes if you plan to attend for 2 semesters.. .

I don't care much for football, and I view competitive college sports as ancillary to the purpose of universities (fitness is great, but it doesn't require sports or intercollegiate competition). However, the athletic department is fairly self sustaining, both bringing in and spending around $100 million a year (ballpark figure; I don't feel like looking up the precise numbers), with football revenue subsidizing most of the other sports, and *success* in football competition providing a range of benefits:. . >""Applying this framework we find robust evidence that football success increases athletic
donations, increases the number of applicants, lowers a school's acceptance rate, increases
enrollment of in-state students, increases the average SAT score of incoming classes, and enhances a school's academic reputation.""^(1). .

Other units like athletics, Michigan medicine, student housing, etc are financially independent from the university itself and are more or less self sufficient, even though they're all governed under the same umbrella. . 13% and 72% come directly from the school website, although I see that the percentage of the general fund that comes from tuition is actually 75% now that I'm double checking, so I remembered that wrong. ""Over 50%"" is a rough ballpark based on the fact that 75% of the general fund comes from tuition and OOS tuition is more than double in state.. . Per the university website,. . >General Fund money comes from student tuition and fees, state support and indirect cost recovery on sponsored research activity. It pays for teaching, academic services, academic and research facilities utilities, operations, and maintenance and administrative support.. . Your education is paid for by the general fund, which is 75% student tuition, over 66% of which is out of state tuition. The endowment does not regularly contribute to the general fund. The endowment is essentially a giant hedge fund that the university gets to operate tax free because they're a university",6.0,neutral,0.8533385992050171

(I'm only considering the current version of ChatGPT; it or similar software will inevitably get *much* better). I think ChatGPT will help make certain things easier for students, but I don't see that as necessarily bad; it makes certain things easier for working professionals as well.. . From my quite limited experience with the current version of ChatGPT, it's somewhat repetitious in its output, despite there being some randomness, so its suggestions for a problem might still get flagged by a cheat-detecting bot. It also seems to have its own stylistic preferences, both in code syntax, and its comments, so if a cheater isn't careful, enough of those might tip off a human reader. I mean you can ask for a function with comments written as Shakespearean sonnets so they're unique, but it still seems to pick the same placement and equivalent meaning of those sonnet comments as it would for someone else who asks for the same function but with comments written in the style of Nicki Minaj.. . Also from what I've seen, it's not so great at complex programs, and seems better suited to small subcomponents of a project, which will require some guidance. It's also prone to unequivocal errors.

It absolutely is possible to get into the program with a subpar grade in ECON 101. . . Yes, it will hold greater weight in the decision process because it's one of the two only admissions requirements (along with ECON 102), and your ability to grasp the concepts in ECON 101 may be reflective of how comfortable you'll be in PUBPOL 330, which is our mandatory economics class and is very much rooted in the theory you learn in ECON 101. . . However, the admissions process is genuinely very holistic. They put a lot of weight on your extracurricular involvements: clubs, jobs, volunteering, that sorta stuff. If you're a freshman planning to apply, my #1 piece of advice would be to join a club or two that are related to policy or activism if you haven't already. And then there are the essays, too. . .

Certainly, U-M is not singularly at fault for being expensive since the cost of attending college throughout the country has increased, and for state schools it has a lot to do with the decrease in the funding they receive from government (https://cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/a-lost-decade-in-higher-education-funding). . . Housing is the 2nd largest expense for a student after tuition, and increasing the housing supply will make housing more affordable. There are 47K U-M students and 121K total Ann Arbor residents, so the university's presence has a significant impact on the local housing market, less if we acknowledge that not all students live in the city, but more if we include university faculty and staff. U-M only houses about 10K of those students in dorms. The university population has been growing at a pace far beyond that of local housing supply. However, it seems that the long term local residents are pretty strongly against property development, and admittedly I can kind of empathize with that sentiment when it seems that all new buildings going up are towering luxury apartments catering to the well off. The city needs more affordable housing development, but I don't know whether investors think affordable housing is profitable, nor whether locals perceive affordable housing as a magnet for undesirables. Maybe the university should build more dorms or reimburse some amount of off-campus rents. Further reading: https://considermagazine.org/housing-in-ann-arbor . . It's still crazy to me that there aren't grocery stores on campus. Target's selection is too small. People's Food Co-Op, Argus Farm Stop, Sparrow Market, Knight's Market, and Ann Arbor farmer's market are too far from where a lot of students live. Requiring a student to have a car or take a bus to get groceries means students are eating out more (expensive) or eating conveniently more (unhealthy). I don't think the university can put up grocery stores on campus, but perhaps they can reduce the prices in their cafes, minimarts, and dining halls, or expand the Maize & Blue Cupboard (https://mbc.studentlife.umich.edu).. . There's much more that can be discussed within a single thread, and I definitely welcome more conversation. In the meantime, know that U-M students are eligible to register to vote in Ann Arbor local elections (https://a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Elections/Pages/Student-Voting.aspx), and they should become informed of the policies that have an impact on their student living experience.",4.0,error,0.0

Employers aren't going to see your transcript as a substitute for training. . . For junior engineers fresh out of school most employers are really just looking for you to apply yourself to what you do choose to study and to take some initiative outside of your classes. No matter what you do in your 4 years in school you're still going to need to learn a ton before you can be a significant contributor on major projects. They're looking for people who are _capable_ of learning what they need to know, and motivated enough to get it done (and not slack off and squeak by on the bare minimum). I think you should take upper level electives that you have an interest in and then when it comes time for job searching think about how to show off that interest and what you've made out of it.. . tl;dr EECS 482 is valuable background but it's not really a big deal if you don't take it.

As long as you pass the coding challenge and coding interview, you will be considered strongly. So don't sweat individual classes too much.. . That being said, there are many concepts taught in 482 that certain employers find to be must-know. Hardcore C++ shops like HPC and HFT will almost always care greatly about your knowledge of how to extract maximum performance from your machine, which generally relies on the concepts taught in 482. Web companies may care about your understanding of parallelism and writing safe concurrency. etc etc.. . I also want to say even if the concepts do not end up helping you in the job search, I strongly strongly recommend it. It is sort of the final class in umich EECS for demystifying how software runs on a real computer, which is exciting to learn and super important if you ever feel like digging deeper, for your own education or a project at work.. . Understanding hardware to be a software engineer is like understanding physics to be a biologist. It can be helpful, but not to all biologists.

I lived in what was a historically sophomore-only dorm, but they've changed that designation in the last few years so it was mostly freshman. It was very quiet and I did not meet anyone. I was so bored all the time and so tired of the meal plan, and very jealous of my friends who lived off campus who had their own kitchens and more independence. I moved out and I'm in an off campus house this semester, and it's a world of difference. I feel so much more like an adult, and I love having the freedom and independence I lacked in the dorm. Also, I have roommates that I hang out with and a common space rather than just a tiny single dorm room. Also off campus is so much cheaper than the dorm.

That said, I do think that you're overstating a few arguments and ignoring some crucial differences, as a general matter. . . ""Beyond a reasonable doubt"" is not quantified in any U.S. court system (at least, none that I am aware of as a lawyer). For some jurors, ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" means they must be 90% sure that someone committed a particular offense; for others it may mean 75% sure. The only metric that everyone agrees on is that ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" is a stricter burden than ""preponderance of the evidence,"" which is just ""more likely than not"" in layman's terms. In other words, if every member of a jury is about 75% sure that a defendant committed a crime, and they all personally quantify ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" as something more than 75%, then the defendant will be found not guilty. In contrast, civil cases use the preponderance of the evidence standard. The U.S. civil system is based on the idea that ""more likely than not"" is sufficient to deprive people of their money or property. There's far more nuance here of course, but your OJ example is not an outlier at all. Again, this is an oversimplification, but if I (as hypothetical victim) can, in a civil battery case, prove with 50.000001% certainty that you punched me and caused me injuries, and a prosecutor can also prove that in a criminal case with the same 50.000001% certainty, then you would be liable to me for damages but face no criminal penalties. . . In terms of when someone should face employment consequences for being accused of a crime, I truly don't know what the correct answer is. But I certainty don't think that, if ""more likely than not"" is enough for one to lose money or property, then ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" is the only standard by which one can lose your job. Our criminal justice system is designed to ensure that the government is least able to punish the innocent, even if that means some guilty go unpunished. That same standard should not, and generally does not, apply to situations without the possibility of criminal sanctions--with the caveat that for Peter Chen, I understand a body of the government is the employer as well.",1.0,neutral,0.5849589705467224

AFAIK, the general guideline in CSE regarding course enrollment cap resembles ""*if you want to take something, you will be able to take it before graduating*"". I find this objective reasonable and adequate. It is the school's responsibility to help you be the best engineer possible when you graduate, helping you gain a slight edge for your junior year internship is at best a nice-to-have. Correct me if I am wrong but I believe even the most sought-after courses such as **EECS 482 have thus far been able to uphold that objective**. If this is the case, then this request addresses a rough edge rather than a fatal flaw. . . Most of the report set forward plain, factual information. With the exception of point 4 which directly relates the number of instructors to teaching capacity, an association that another comment has disputed, the rest of the data allow the following of the author's conclusions:. . 1. EECS 482 capacity has not kept up with either the growth of the overall CS student population (is this relevant?) and the growth in demand for the class specifically (definitely relevant). 2. Classroom capacity is not the limiting factor on class size. Note the caveat that just because we can fit 60 students into one section, doesn't mean we necessarily should but this seems to be a tradeoff the authors are willing to accept. Again, whether this is fair to the currently enrolled students is debatable. . . I did not say ""failed to keep up"" because it certainly hasn't failed under the success criteria I set forth previously. . . The following assertions are not sufficiently and directly supported:. . 1. Other ULCS classes have continued to scale up their capacity - no data presented. 2. The low capacity creates a competitive/cutthroat atmosphere - no data presented . 3. The low capacity doesn't conform with published priorities and goals set out in the CSE climate report - see success criteria discussion . . In my personal opinion, this report ultimately fails to argue what would be a strong point, namely that the low-class capacity hampers the CSE atmosphere. As the authors' remarked, CSE's mission is to ""empower every individual to reach their full potential"", which is essentially restating the success criteria. **EECS 482 has thus far achieved this mission and the author did not provide data showing the contrary**. Again, correct me if that's not the case.. . In conclusion, while the report establishes that EECS 482 capacity is an issue, it does not establish that it should be a priority for the CSE. . .

The difference now is that the scramble doesn't happen in Sept / Nov. which is what occurred under the old rules that didn't allow lease signing until 70 days into the current lease. According to the new law, this is supposed to happen in March for most people whose leases start in August. Unfortunately, a lot of landlords have instituted exploitative waitlists which the city can likely outright ban if tenants call for this.",2.0,negative,0.660620391368866

Fun fact. Ann Arbor's murder of crows is one of the largest murders in Michigan. They do communal roosting behavior during the winter which is why you see them in such massive flocks this time of year. During the day they split up and fly all around the county, and then return to roost at night. One of my favorite memories of being a student was watching the crows stream in as the sun began to set. . . There can be upwards of 10,000 crows in this roost at any given night - sometimes more!
Historically we have had more like 20,000 crows but West Nile really did a number on them.

Shopping tips: If you have the time and means (this is a big part) I'd suggest not getting all of your groceries in the same place. . . * My split is, in this order ( I know it's not that deep): . * Dollar Tree: Canned foods, spices, and anything where the specific brand doesn't matter.. * Aldi: Produce and staples like eggs or milk. * Meijer/Target/Trader Joes: anything specific like frozen foods or specific brands. * Costco: The big boy expenses like toilet paper, frozen vegetables, protein shakes, etc.. . This split really helps prioritize getting cheap items at cheap stores instead of spending $4 for a bottle of cumin where it's $1.25 at dollar tree. . . Personal expenses:. . I get away with spending about $150-200/month for my girlfriend and I. I think that the biggest thing that has helped is removing meat from groceries for the most part(I know, it sucks) and replacing proteins with eggs (of course they're expensive right now but let's ignore that) and beans/lentils. Another note is to make sure that your staple meals mainly consist of super cheap ingredients. An example is using beans/lentils and rice for a majority of meals along with rotating spices, vegetables, and sauces. Oatmeal/homemade egg burritos are a good cheap breakfast go-to and rice/pasta w vegetables or peanut butter sandwiches are a good lunch in my opinion.

But not everyone in CS wants to be a hardcore programmer. There are network engineers, sys admins, ci/cd teams, pms, the list goes on and on. Yes, internships are nice. I had some great friends that built careers off of them. I didn't and I still have a great career, I got a job at a local place and did IT work - before college even. Those connections were a lot more useful to me than being one of 100 interns at a big company. So luck of the draw. On a side note one of our main programmers worked at chick filet in college and was hired for that specific reason - the hiring manager figured it showed motivation and the ability to work under pressure. He was right. I also worked for a company that had interns and we had zero idea what to do with them and their time was effectively wasted (free money though I guess).. . So your advice to keep up is great, but even better if you can apply it to something you are interested in and have fun with it. Like automating something fun, fixing your grandparents up with something, etc.. . Also, just to add, the job market sucks right now, especially for anyone new and anyone foreign. Ive just seen entire work forces laid off because now that everyone is remote, why not be remote in X country where workers are cheaper. This is going to destroy big tech hubs like Seattle. Plus as a hiring manager you now get 1000 times more resumes on your desk than before when work was local. And some percent is fake, I had a co-worker have a new hire show up that wasn't the same person they had been on zoom with and completed the interviews. I personally did a coding exercise with someone and they had a comment they forgot to remove that said it was written by someone else. Fun times. Hiring just totally sucks right now more than ever. So don't beat yourself up about it. The very most important thing I can tell you is that if you are a hard worker, make friends. You will never have the opportunity after college again to do that as easily. They will recommend you if they like you and know you, and you do the same. This is why companies give huge referral bonuses.",4.0,neutral,0.5314213633537292

Besides that, a lot of advice here are pretty valid such as applying early, taking all the shots you can get, using the summer to get prepared etc. I do wish I had seen more of those in freshman year.

I will preface this all by saying that I am not an expert and I don't want to make it sound like I have credibility in these things. I have noticed some stuff as I have worked through my own situations and I just want to share my observations in the hopes that someone may benefit. This isn't a formal report for english class, so please forgive me if I made some mistakes in formatting or grammar.. . . 1) Short term relaxation and fun makes coming back to messes and problems even worse. I can go enjoy a couple days somewhere else and have fun, but when I come back I have the same problems I left behind.. . 2) Tackling problems (at least for me) is extremely satisfying and rewarding. I just got done reorganizing my desk and I am excited to have a more usable space to get my schoolwork done.. . Geez this got long. . 3) Conflict resolution is an incredibly valuable skill to learn and use. I have no idea what happened between you and your roommate (and it is none of my business) but I will say that one of the best things someone can do in a similar situation is to forgive them and stay amicable throughout the remainder of their time living together. In my experience, holding onto anger towards someone else benefits no one and merely serves as a means to justify negative emotions, stress, sadness, etc. Blame and responsibility are things I have struggled with (and still do) but I have found that considering the following helps me. . If I had done something seriously upsetting or damaging to someone I know, I would feel terrible and want their forgiveness or at least some opportunity to end our relationship with respect and dignity.. . I do my best to treat others how I wish to be treated, and so far the positive vibes have been coming back around.. . 4) Ask for help. I am always shocked by how willing people are to assist. When I am honest with people about my struggles, they are almost always empathetic and understanding of what I am dealing with. Situations and experiences differ greatly, but asking for help has always been a great first step whenever I can't or don't know how to deal with something.. . 5) Don't get discouraged when something doesn't work out. I know how vanilla this sounds, but it is completely true. It is super easy for me to get down on myself about something tough regardless of how many times I have been told this. Over the past year, I have been making an effort to get better in this regard, but there is always room for improvement.. . 6) Step back. Whenever I am having a tough time, I find it beneficial to stop, take a break, and look past my current struggles to the bigger picture. I like to take a long, hot shower and just contemplate my current situation. Even if I don't come up with a solution, hot showers are relaxing af.. . . I hope you found something in this helpful.

It's surprisingly clean, though, and the house seems really close-knit.

A priori: relating to knowledge derived from logical deduction, rather than observed experience (which would be a posteriori). Yet your statements aren't even remotely logically sound. It's horrifically ironic. . . . > and why you're so angry about having to learn a language.. . Totally off topic. We're discussing whether or not a person needs to be bilingual to be considered well educated, not how I feel about languages. See above. (Although, for clarity's sake, I'm not angry about having to learn a language; right now, I'm angry because I think you're wilfully ignorant and I don't like people who are wilfully ignorant.) . . > There was never a point in history where the majority of people knew how to ride a horse,. . You've now picked a fringe statement of mine to criticize, rather than actually trying to dismantle my main point. Yet another thing that philosophy classes will teach you not to do. . . That said, yes, every student at Oxford or Harvard or Michigan or any western liberal arts bastion would indeed have known how to ride a horse. . . > but most people know more than one language. . Historically speaking? No, most people didn't know more than one language. Most people spoke one language, couldn't read or write any language, and never traveled more than 20 miles from their home. So they wouldn't have needed to know another language. . . Did most *educated* people know more than one language? Certainly, but then see above about the horses. . . Totally off topic again. It's not relevant what most people historically have done. Historically, most people knew how to churn butter, how to darn a sock, and what the right time of year to plant wheat was. It doesn't mean that we, now, are poorly educated because we don't know how to churn butter or darn socks or plant wheat. . . You can't just keep repeating your point without considering objections to it. ANOTHER thing a philosophy class would teach you not to do. It's, like, the central point of philosophy. Arguing and reasoning properly. . . > it's embarrassing . . Feelings don't come into play here. . . > that every other nation has to accommodate ignorant Americans who only know English.. . See above. Again. There are more than seven thousand languages in the world; no matter what happened, people were going to gradually move towards a handful of languages that allowed them to dialogue globally. . . The languages used by the UN, and that are widely business dominant globally, are English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. Americans aren't being accommodated in that regard; if we all spoke Blurgh and nobody else spoke Blurgh and we expected everyone else to learn Blurgh, that would be different. Anyone natively speaking any other language is going to have to adapt to speaking one or more of the globally dominant languages. It happens that English is one of those languages and is the dominant one of those languages. . . Now, you're focusing on people just learning a single language, any language. What about fringe languages, like Sanskrit, which is only spoken natively by about 20,000 people? The LSA requirement allows people to learn, say, Latin or ancient Greek (which is hugely different from modern Greek, much like old English bears little resemblance). Why? Does that enable someone to dialogue with other people, or do foreigners still have to cater to English-speaking Americans? That would suggest that other countries and their interpretation of Americans is not the key deterministic factor in the language requirement.. . > And I've passed Phil 101, 183, 340, 409, 475, and 482. . . My statement was rhetorical; I don't really care.
