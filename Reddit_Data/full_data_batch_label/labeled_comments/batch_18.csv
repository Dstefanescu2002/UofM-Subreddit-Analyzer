Most nights I was staying up until 4am and getting up at 7 for class at 8. I ended up so burnt out even my self-absorbed family started to worry.. . I ended up withdrawing from that class and just choosing random classes the next semester that I thought sounded really fun and interesting (that could also count for distribution requirements if I didn't choose to major in them).

You might not be choosing us but we think that's ok! Here are our programs, we just want you to have a great fit."" UofM framed their tour as, ""hey you got accepted, great!

Getting a master's degree here was my backup plan to not finding a full time job before graduating from here for undergrad. I knew exactly what I wanted to do and umich had a professional master's degree that was very closely related and I didn't find a job in that field before I graduated from undergrad so the easy solution for me was to just take a vacation and then go directly to that master's program (only applied to umich). I've lived in Ann Arbor since I was 5 so I never really got to leave Ann Arbor except for actual vacations and am glad that my parents at least let me live on my own for undergrad (they forced me to stay with them for grad school since they were paying).

The acceptance rate is ~50% but I would keep in mind that many people don't put a lot of effort into the application so you asking this question here shows an initiative which is a great start. Don't know much about the transfer angle but you do have to submit a resume along with essays. Get your resume reviewed by as many people as possible (feel free to dm me)! You don't have to take every suggestion but having as many eyes on it as possible is always good. . . In terms of the essays, they're short and make you choose your words carefully. The first question about why you want to be in the minor is probably more important and I would really do your research about what classes and resources are available. Simply saying ""I want to be a math major who can learn about the business world"" won't cut it, you should think about how it would benefit you in school and your career. Obviously, you might not have your whole life figured out and that's ok! For me, the business minor was about understanding how organizations and people work, not just the computer I was programming on. I was also excited about the opportunity to be with fellow business-curious peers across majors to bounce ideas off of and learn about their interests. What I'm saying is that your essay doesn't have to outline your career path in detail but how the skills you gain from the classes you take will help open new doors and create meaningful relationships. . . The introduction essay is a bit wonky and I hated writing it lol. I think I just wrote the first things that came to my mind, just be yourself and don't come off as unapproachable. Remember, they have your resume so no need to list off your accomplishments, I'm pretty sure Gordon Ramsay was mentioned in my essay .. . Lastly it's not the end of the world if you don't get in.

There are certainly plenty of people who study econ and a stem subject like math, cs, ds, or stats, and I know a few people who are premed so they are doing a bio related major and then one in a social science of their choosing that they are super interested.

I don't think my workload is any different than it would be if I was taking random electives instead of polisci, so the workload is fine.. . Since you fulfill the requirements for both majors you certainly know enough about both subjects, and as to whether you care about them, that is up to each individual. I realized I am more passionate about math than I am polisci, so that is why I am switching, but when I was more into polisci there was certainly plenty of passion for that and cs.. . . . I picked cs and polisci because I was interested in going into academia, and cs seemed like it would give me a big leg up in admission to PhD programs. It was also a fairly strong back up plan in case academia didn't work out. I ended up realizing I actually enjoyed cs, so then I got more into it because of the growing use of quantitative skills in social sciences.. . . . If you are interested in both I would certainly recommend it. For my polisci class last semester I used machine learning, specifically k means clustering, to analyze religious sermons, so there really is a lot of cool work to be done at the intersection of stem and polisci.

That allocation is decided on federal and state levels. For example, when various governments put extra emphasis on vaccinating K-12 teachers, doses were (re)allocated towards that goal, and counties and school districts were able to schedule dedicated vaccination events.. . The reason booking appointments right now is so frustrating is twofold. First, there are not enough doses available to match ""logistical"" capacities of many vaccination sites (e.g., the Big House can do several thousand shots, but there are only enough doses to do a few hundred in a typical day right now). OK, you may say, it's ok if my appointment is not for a while, but I just want to get one scheduled and on the books, so that I can stop wasting time checking websites over and over. That's the second problem: right now, dose delivery commitments to various locations is done mostly on a week-by-week basis. So, they can't put up a schedule with open slots that would allow people to book too far into the future -- they don't know if that number of slots will turn out to be too many or not enough.. . But, given the increasing availability of doses, hopefully in a few weeks the above issues will be solved, or at least improved. If/when dose supply is no longer the limiting factor, the university may well be able to offer vaccination clinics to employees and students in addition to the opportunities through your doctor, or pharmacy, or the WC health department. Maybe not quite as ad hoc as the flu clinics each fall, since you still need to manage density of (unvaccinated) people, but reasonably convenient. I feel that vaccinating employees (and maybe even students who live in Ann Arbor over the summer) in time for Fall is very reasonable. The students who are not in A2, or will not be past the end of classes, will be harder to reach in advance, but hopefully their home communities will ramp up their vaccination rates by summer as well.

There is a variety of ways to interpret the question ""do they care?"". Are they going to give someone permission to continue working fully remotely because the person did not get vaccinated, even though they have no medical reasons not to, and there have been plenty of appointments available, say, through MM for weeks? Probably not. Just like right now they don't let students use campus facilities if they are not getting weekly tests -- because testing capacity right now is plentiful and flexible. . . But if there is, say, a major snafu in the supply chain that results in dose deliveries not meeting the current projections, then, they claim, they'll scale back. If it's going even better than projected, then, as they said, they might scale in-person activities up. . . And I do think they would try to set up dedicated vaccination drives if it's at all feasible, just like they do with the flu vaccine every year. It's just that right now, they have no ability to say if, when, how, or how much they would be able to do that, because they would need permission from government-level entities to organize something like that while supplies are tight. I'd rather they don't discuss things like that in advance until they have a reasonable plan for execution. And besides, if state- and nation-wide production ramp up and distribution through doctors' offices, health departments, and federally-run sites will proceed without major irreversible setbacks, it wouldn't even matter whether specific employers do anything above and beyond.. .

This is pure speculation on my part, but I would imagine a current UM student ID should be evidence enough that you are currently living or working in Ann Arbor. :-). .

I love UM and think it's a great school. Ann Arbor is probably my favorite city of all time too. And I definitely benefitted from opportunities available at UM that may not be as prevalent elsewhere.

Eecs 183 gets you into great shape for CS at this school and is a class that has a lot of resources to go above the requirements of the class and learn even more. It's not an easy class, even if you know CS. Honestly I'd really recommend 183, unless you feel really comfortable with large CS projects and concepts. If you are insistant on jumping to 280, there are plenty of C++ tutorials online you could do. But it's not like learning the language is the hard part... for 203, you can try learning discrete math concepts online too. That is a hard class for most students in cs, so it'll take away time from your other courses if you wanna do well in it.. . Thank you so much for the advice! For 203, I'm really fortunate to have experience with pure math classes so I'm hoping that will help me! I was wondering what's the biggest difference between 183 and 280 and what makes 280 so much more difficult?

At the end of 183 you started doing bigger more complicated projects with less starter code, and that's exactly were 280 picks up. If you wanna jump into the harder projects, I don't think you'd necessarily learn more. I think you can learn a lot from 183, even coming in with some experience.",4.0,positive,0.7982428669929504

t1_gr0bon0,2021-03-15 13:11:41,t3_m5b08u,t3_m5b08u,"this is all a guess, but the probability of getting off the waitlist depends entirely on how many accepted people decide to declare. If every accepted student declared PPE, then nobody on the waitlist gets in. Based on how many people pursue this major in addition to Ford/OS/other application majors, there is a strong likelihood that a good deal of people get off the waitlist. . . However, how your grades play into that is questionable. Here's where I start guessing. Either they have already ranked the waitlist by strength, in which case your position is likely not dependent on a grade from this semester (bc they will have already pulled grades from when you applied). This seems like the most likely scenario. Yet, I could see them reconvening to discuss waitlist slots at a later point, which might entail them pulling grades ~ early or mid april (this is less likely though, especially given their email rhetoric). . . So, while it probably doesn't matter if you take the P, if you can afford waiting until you have already heard then that might not be the worst idea. If you get in, though, then taking the P definitely doesn't matter especially if it's not a Core requirement",2.0,neutral,0.7743092775344849

We all want to get back to ""normal-ish."" **However, I would strongly caution students against taking these plans as gospel.** Keep in mind that Schlissel's role in the university is very big picture, setting the vision, etc. It's not really his role to consider the reality of how this ""vision"" will be carried out, which is going to be much trickier. Something as simple as having an appointment with a staff or faculty member is going to be difficult to do ""with mitigation measures in place.""

Their pearls are little bit hard for my personal preference but they're fine. I don't come here often because it's on north campus though.. * **Sharetea:** they have small pearls, which are my favorite, and I like their fruit teas too. The black tea latte (black tea with milk) is WAY better than their milk tea, and I think I prefer the black tea latte over Coco milk tea. (Also, I'm not lactose intolerant.) I heard that they use fruit jams for these, which makes me feel very healthy. The peach kiwi tea has real kiwi parts in it too :). * **Chatime:** imo, best brown sugar milk! Ding Tea's is okay but it's really expensive (I paid $7 for a regular with tip >.>) and Tea Ninja's was disappointing like what I can make at home (okay, but I certainly wouldn't pay for it). I haven't had Coco's. Also, they use real black sugar pearls and you can taste the difference. I also like the normal pearls since they're perfect for what I like. However, after comparing with other stores, I don't really like their milk tea anymore, and the black tea latte kinda sucks. I also don't think their fruit teas are worth it, it's just syrup.. . These are actually all Taiwanese franchises (though I've only seen Coco in Taiwan LOL) :). . A few more thoughts about the other places:. . * **Ding Tea**: I feel like it's expensive because they charge you extra for no ice and I'm scarred by the price I paid for the brown sugar milk. I did not like their milk tea. The pearls are a pretty color (yes, this is a pro for me) and they taste decent.. * **Sweeting**: I went recently and it was actually okay.

The exception is the week between Christmas and New Years, when the University closes down. Those are days staff get off because they have ""banked"" them by working on certain federal holidays like President's Day and so on. (Of course certain essential staff will work on that break out of necessity, like DPSS). To get time off, staff ask for it within the allotment vacation/time off in their contracts, subject to the needs/policies of their department.. . All that said, it is definitely the case that when the Academic side of the University is on break (i.e. spring break in normal years) or slows down (like during summer), staff may be more likely to take vacation, work on special projects that aren't as feasible during the academic term, have casual dress days, and so on. Taking vacation is sometimes done because it's simply more feasible with so many faculty/students away, or because it's when it's most convenient (maybe staff have family who are faculty and/or students and they want to be off when they're off). I know in one office I was in, we had to balance our time off in the office so we didn't have too many people out at once, and that sometimes meant people who would have liked to be off during UM's spring break could not be.. . That's NORMAL times and we're in anything BUT normal times. . . As a staff member, I've found this year so demanding I have spent almost zero vacation and even took almost no time when a family member died. When we got the extra days around the holidays, it seemed like a small thing but it ended up feeling like a big benefit. . . Conceptually, I like the idea of getting these days off too. Technically many staff could *ask* for these days off, but with the University going on as usual that can mean missing meetings and calls, encumbering co-workers who have to cover for your tasks, etc. Not everyone can take the time off, it would be first-come, first-served. Anyone who has burned through days because they needed them after expending sick or family care could also not take them. So a ""universal day off"" would be a help to many people.. .

The reliability of neuropsychological testing for adult ADHD has been criticized for years because most of the tests were created to evaluate children and are now being used to test adults. These adults have (to some extent) adapted to cope with neuropsychological issues and are more than capable of ""passing"" neuropsychological tests which decreases the reliability of said tests.. . OP doesn't mention their gender, but it's worth pointing out that while there does seem to be a rampant overdiagnosis of ADHD (especially among college students), there are studies that suggest ADHD is significantly UNDERDIAGNOSED in women and girls. More often than not, girls/women tend to have inattentive ADHD vs boys/men that tend to have combined or hyperactive type. Girls/women are more likely to fly under the radar since they are less disruptive in the classroom or work environment. Societal pressures also have a strong influence on how ADHD symptoms manifest in girls/women which makes their symptoms less noticeable. Women and girls are more likely to be incorrectly misdiagnosed with anxiety/depression when in reality they have ADHD.. . . Despite all this, neuropsychological evaluations are more comprehensive and include surveys/interviews done by the patient's family/friends which can definitely remove some of the subjectivity of psychological/psychiatric evals. . . I will confirm that you don't necessarily need a neuropsychological evaluation for an ADHD diagnosis as a psychological/psychiatric evaluation is sufficient. Personally, I recently had a psychiatric evaluation done because I was not interested in waiting months to get an appointment for a neuropsychological evaluation (or paying thousands of dollars for one) and I was able to get the help I needed much sooner. . .

She got her bail paid in three different jurisdictions for here resisting arrest charges, is that not enough support for the black community?. .

Staff make up the majority of people on-site at the university right now. Not only are they on-site and risking their health, but because others are working from home and things were paused for so long, staff are being overworked and understaffed. In many situations, expectations and workloads have increased without added support. This has added physical and mental stress to staff members. Asking for things to be better where they can be is not taking anything away from anyone else, the concept of scarcity is holding everyone back. Staff raising each other up at university and asking for the same rights afforded faculty and students isn't outrageous; it's righteous and more importantly it's not at the expense of essential workers. I would also like to dispel the idea that staff are paid some magical salary at university that affords them some lavish lifestyle (I actually made more as a barista); some staff barely make ends meet and live paycheck to paycheck. Honestly, I can't think of a single staff member I know that lives in Ann Arbor on their university salary alone, in fact I know many staff members that moonlight in the very industries you are talking about so they can afford to live. Staff moves the university; without staff, it would cease to function--yes, even during the pandemic. So while this may seem privileged, I think fighting for all workers rights regardless of what they are doing is the answer--value the person doing the labor and not what type of labor it is. I supported essential workers in many ways throughout the pandemic, many of my closest friends are in the restaurant industry and were hit hard by coronavirus restrictions.

t1_grjp7v0,2021-03-20 01:31:00,t3_m8uc96,t3_m8uc96,"You should specify your goal such as career job perspectives and other details before getting more recommendations or feedbacks. It is really hard to determine what is useful without that info. E.g A front end developer (web design and etc) may never use statistics significantly. And you won't be able to learn any Complementary knowledge in statistics. It is thus not meaningful to diversify skills in this way. . . To convince you about this point further, let's look at what the minor in applied statistics is composed of. . . Other than Calc and Stats 250, which should be already required in CS, you need Stats 306, 401 as core courses. . . Stats 306 is a class about data visualization in R(ggplot 2 and tidyverse) + funcs and loops. It prepares students to read documents in R on their own. Visualization might be useful but I doubt if a Cs student is unable to self-study them in Python in 2-3 weeks via some online tutorial. . . Stats 401 is a non-mathematical regression class. I'd say that unless you are going for Phd (e.g Econ phd utilizes OLS all over the place in research papers) , most career jobs do not require regression methods beyond what taught in EECS 445. Btw, 445 is more mathematically rigorous than 401. . . Then, you need two upper statistic electives. Stats 403 is a very intro survey class and if you are not going for social science Phd or related government jobs, you won't need any of those knowledge, so do Stats 470 and 480. . . Other popular options are Stats 406,415,449. I've not taken 449 and thus not being able to comment it. . . For stats 406, it is a bunch of hypothesis testing with Monte Carlo Methods + peripheral ML. For stats 415, it is statistical Ml with an eye toward data analysis and be aware that this class does not teach about neural network. Those two classes could be useful if you incline towards somewhat data scientists positions. . . I've also taken Stats 526 (note that there is an easier version(Stats 430)) and both of these two could satisfy the elective requirements. They might be useful if you want to specialize deep learning and have a solid foundation of math in advance. Note that you could do EECS 501,502 in Cs dept and they are more useful and specifically designed for CS students, but definitely, you won't be able to get a minor anymore. . . I've also heard that some students take 506,507 as undergrads electives. But not very useful from my opinion, if given Cs backgrounds. . . To sum up, you should specify your goal first and then ask advisors for what statistical knowledge might be complementary in this field or meaningful to diversify skills. There are really so much concepts that no one is able to grasp all of them or worth your efforts to learn.",3.0,error,0.0

I am going to show my naivete of all things chemistry, but as I understand it, the arrows are crucial in expressing the properties and behaviors of the molecule, or the fundamental nature of the reaction. So, a picture that is missing one arrow could indicate a forgotten brush of a pencil, the orgo equivalent of a typo, or a misunderstanding of a basic concept in chemistry. . . Typos happen to everyone. It does sometimes happen that a typo as small as a single character or comma can change the meaning or a sentiment of a sentence, but fortunately that doesn't happen often, and when the consequences are that significant, we would probably catch the error while proofreading if we have a mastery of the language and are paying attention. However, in chemistry, *almost every* ""typo"" changes the meaning in a significant way. . . To push the analogy even further, I probably wouldn't expend much effort proofreading, say, a casual text to a friend (or a Reddit post ). But if I am taking an exam on the fundamentals in a language class, you bet I'll scrutinize every brush of my pencil before submitting my answers! To me, an exam that assesses a student's success in learning chemistry fundamentals is more akin to the latter, not the former.. . Which gets to the toughest question instructors face when assessing what the students have learned. Say, an answer to a grammar question is supposed to be a sentence where the subject is a plural noun, but the student wrote a singular noun. Is this a typo -- did the student simply forget to write the ""s"" at the end of the word, or simply didn't hit the key on the keyboard hard enough? Or does the student not fully understand the concept of subject/verb agreement, or doesn't know the plural form of the noun in question, which are precisely the fundamental things I'm trying to evaluate by this question? . . Alas, an instructor doesn't have access to the students' thoughts while they were answering a question. All that is available for grading are the final answers the students submitted. All the instructor can evaluate is whether these answers are correct.. . On the student's side, I KNOW it feels more frustrating when, on the surface, your incorrect answer is off only by one letter/comma/arrow than when it's off by a whole word or multiple components of the picture. Especially when you remember thinking about the right answer in your mind while you were writing down what turned out to be incorrect, i.e., you made a typo. But how something makes us feel is not necessarily correlated with what's the right/fair/equitable way to grade. . . Let me end with this story: I once took a proof- and derivation-based math class where the instructor graded assignments (not exams, if I remember correctly) by just marking whether a particular question was answered correctly or not, but not *what specifically* was wrong. Could be a small error in arithmetic, could be a bad explanation that made the reader misunderstand your thinking, or could be a big logical fallacy. Then he returned our assignments, and we could re-write the answers that were marked as wrong again, and again, and again (while working on new assignments) -- essentially until the exam. Ultimately, the grade for the homeworks was based on how many questions you answered fully correctly by the end of the term. That was an interesting experience! On the one hand, it meant that we couldn't get access to solution manuals for a while, until much closer to the exam. On the other hand, when the mistakes were the math equivalents of ""typos,"" we could correct them and get full credit pretty quickly -- which meant that nobody was left with a sour feeling of ""but I know what the right answer is, I just forgot to 'draw one arrow'!"" On balance, I liked the experience, although I realize that's not going to work in most courses for various reasons.. . Sorry for droning on. I originally started out in an educational setting where partial credit wasn't used at all, so adjusting to the US traditions raises all sorts of questions for me.",11.0,error,0.0

I've never been to Berkeley, but my impression of it is that it's much more similar to UMich than to UMinn.. . There are some similarities between the two U of M's, like some similar looking architecture, facilities, and similar sized student population. But UMinn's campus to me felt like a small oasis constrained in a fairly run down industrial area, and quite separate from the cities around it. The Mississippi River bounds the campus on one side, so right off the bat that cuts off about 180deg of surrounding land. Then you've got major interstate expressways about a quarter mile to either side of campus, and about 20 lanes of railroad tracks a few blocks to the north running parallel to the river. Beyond the tracks is a very industrial area...warehouses, chemical, and manufacturing facilities. There are a few restaurants and other retail businesses within that constrained area near campus, and there are some residential neighborhoods nearby, but it seems like the area relies more on large 4- to 8- story apartment buildings east of campus to house that many students in that small an area. While you can cross bridges to get to Minneapolis, downtown is like a couple miles away, so it's there but seems like more than a casual stroll. . . That's all extremely different from UMich. UMich's central campus is extremely woven into the city of Ann Arbor, with retail businesses immediately surrounding the campus in most directions, and the business district to the northwest flows into the main downtown area about a half mile away, while in other directions they quickly give way to residential neighborhoods with houses or generally small apartment buildings. There are some 10-12 story residential buildings within the business areas right next to campus and downtown, but a lot of students rent houses as well. Expressways ring the city of Ann Arbor, but are like 2 miles from campus, so you aren't generally aware of them near campus. Warehouses and industrial parks are also about that far away...there used to be warehouses in or near downtown, but I think they've mostly been repurposed or replaced.. . UMich's north campus, which houses the engineering, art, architecture, and music schools is separated from central campus, so that could be important if that covers your field of study. There are frequent short shuttle buses between central and north campus, but north campus is more isolated from the city, and from retail locations and residential neighborhoods in most directions. There are a few restaurants on north campus in university buildings, and a strip of businesses along a busy street to the north of campus, but it's not like central campus' integration with the city.",5.0,error,0.0

One thing to keep in mind is that ux is a very broad term and product design is different from ui design, although the two go hand in hand! (also just in general so many things fall under ux -- interaction design, user research, onwards and upwards) and the BSI will train you in the theory behind ux and learning to code is a pretty significant part of the curriculum (to get in and graduate you will probably be taking at least two python classes and html/css class). . . I don't know the stamps curriculum so I can't speak to it, but I am pretty sure stamps will not make you code. I think SI prepares you reasonably well for a very wide range of tech jobs (consulting, tech consulting, ux design, data analyst, etc) which can be a good place to start from if you know you want to work with design and tech but maybe aren't exactly sure what you'd want your career to be.",1.0,positive,0.6454654932022095

Feel free to PM me if you want to know more information. However, some specially desgined classes for IB such as financial trading (Fin 440) won't be open to you.. . Secondly, I have A+ for all economic classes and don't see the point of claiming being hard to get a good grade in Econ dept. After David Miller becomes undergraduate director of Economics Department, they decide to introduce much better departmental curve, at least 35% A range. It is comparable to business core classes which have around 40%. In fact, Econ classes give out much better curves, 30% A, 50% A- would be something that you could anticipate. Moreover, Fin 435 (Financial Economics) has 50% A, as one of the most generous class on grading scheme. But I do not recommend this class given my recommended above fin class list.. .

If it's a class, a program, a faculty member--this is academic and you should start with the school/college where this is located.. . What may be a little confusing is that your school/college probably has some student affairs function (an office, or at least a person with this in their area of responsibility and title). While they're typically more involved with non-academic parts of your experience, they may still be a reasonable resource because since they are located within the school or college, they report to the academic dean in some fashion.. . The Dean of Students, and other divisions of the VP for Student Life, is different. Those offices *support* the academic side but they aren't a part of the academic side. They're primarily involved with things outside of academics. They may collaborate with academic units on some things (Living learning communities, internships, etc) but the student life offices don't have authority over instruction, faculty, or curriculum.

(TLDR: you're taking classes badly run enough to be notorious for it, things are extra shite right now, but they'll be back to normal come fall, though some things will still suck ass under normal conditions anyway). . **Orgo and Math**: these classes are notoriously awful even in a non-corona year and are treated like ""weeders"" in the sense that they are needlessly a pain in the ass. This is why so many people take their Calc1/2/3/4 at Washtenaw Community College or similar over the summer and transfer it in. I tried doing it (115) at umich and had to drop because I was under the struggle bus. I also basically got so close to failing out of my original major that I just jumped ship on it and had to change to something that was easier for me to handle because there was less emphasis on weeder course bullshit I couldn't get through, which is really when my mental health and quality of life took a turn for the better.. . You're not wrong in recognizing some courses are just run in a very cognitively grindy and fucked-up way, but an unfortunate part of adapting to UMich, or maybe just college in general, is figuring out your own limits and figuring out what kind of tradeoffs you're willing to make in terms of your goals versus your quality-of-life, and as a school that takes in a lot of type-A-personality-folk, it can be a mental/culture/experiential shock to the system for a lot of us having to adapt to that way of thinking, where we're forced to recognize limits we weren't driven that close to at our former schools.. . **Re: classes being online**, yeah, that does make things a lot worse, but some courses (Orgo, Any Calc, EECS 203/281, etc) are just always a landmine you don't want to step on unless necessary. I've definitely had a harder time learning certain types of topics online and felt like overall I'm mostly teaching myself things in about half of my courses, more last term than this term.. . **Re: your comment about the pandemic**. . The pandemic response is definitely a bit fucked, but I don't think anyone could have genuinely fully convinced themselves with the unrealistic expectation of an in-person fall 2020 during the middle of a global pandemic. That said, the U pretending it was on the board was a shite move. Cutting fall and spring break made 100% sense, but also, they should've split them up and given us more like 4-5 wellness days and not 2, which was jank and soul-draining.. . **Re: vaccination & fall 2021**. . I mean, by fall everyone with half a brain (who can safely be vaccinated) will be vaccinated, so it wouldn't make sense for things to *not* be on-campus and back-to-normal by fall semester unless we get a whole shiny new corona virus.

The debt component is definitely a big deal and honestly props to you for keeping real about that, because I think a lot of people here take on massive debt for degrees that won't really afford them the ability to pay back their loans for a long, long time and the idea of making those huge financial choices at, like, age 18(ish) is culturally questionable. You could also speak with advising and just say you want to take a gap year and go sort yourself out.

Both EECS 183 and Physics 240 were irrelevant to my degree choice- but my advisor insisted that I was too ignorant to know what degree I'd actually like to pursue (because I transferred from community college). Aside from that, Physics 240 was so difficult that I dropped it in my first semester.. . Also, at my previous college, I took AP Calculus 2. It did not transfer because I hadn't covered one subsection of a section of a chapter in the textbook. The math department said that they wouldn't make accommodation for this because they didn't write exams for subsections of sections of chapters. My previous Calculus professor wrote a letter to UM's math department and they still wouldn't budge. I ended up retaking the class and barely passing (I only passed because I used my notes from the school that I transferred from). I even stopped reading the textbook because my old textbook was far superior.. . In another class, when attending office hours to ask for feedback regarding poor-ish grades for certain assignments the professor told me: even if the assignment meets all of the criteria- it still isn't worth a 100% unless you go beyond what's expected in the class.. . . This school takes pride in the sleep deprived and overworked student stereotype. I used to work full-time as a student but now it's impossible with the workload and limited number of class sections available.. . People say the community is great, too, but I haven't had that experience. I come from a poor background as a first generation student.

As other people mentioned, Ohio Rite Aid walk-ins are one approach...some of them take people regardless of qualifying criteria, so healthy, jobless students could go. Hour and a half drive, and walk-in means no guarantee; check for recent threads about this in /u/annarbor and /u/coronavirusmichigan for latest updates, and maybe try calling a store and talking to a person.. . I've had success getting appointments for three people at specific Rite Aids in Michigan. The key is to keep retrying a location (clicking the Next button for a selected location) every second or so, and if you get to the calendar screen, VERY quickly selecting a time and clicking Next to lock in the appointment that just opened up. You can take your time filling out the rest of the web page (contact info, last 4 of social, doctor info, medical info, etc...you can skip things or answer ""don't know"" if you don't know) until it shows your confirmation number. It took me maybe an average of about 10 hours of clicking for each appointment. If you can't spend that much time at it, certain times seem to have more appointments opening than others, and maybe 11:45pm to 12:05am would be the best time block to go hard, or if you have more time, 10pm to 12:05am...I think I got one appointment around 10pm, and one around midnight. But appointments also seemed to start opening up early in the morning, like somewhere in the 7am to 9am range, and I also thought there were more in the 11am to 2pm range...I haven't heard others suggest those times, the way I've heard about near-midnight times, and I didn't collect detailed data on it to confirm, but that's my informal personal observation.. . If you have videos to watch on your computer, just shrink your Rite Aid browser window a bit, and move it half off the screen, so you can just keep clicking the Next button while you watch a vid in the other window.. . On Rite Aid's Qualifier page, if you choose Michigan as the location, they currently seem to want either 65+ year olds, or 16+ year olds with a qualifying medical condition or occupation...smoking or obesity, among others, qualify you on Rite Aid's page at age 16+. If you choose Ohio, they want either 40+ year olds, or different qualifying criteria. Whichever location you choose on the qualifying page, you are asked for your full address on the appointment scheduling page once you snag an appointment.. . If an appointment opens up at a location you're trying, but someone else gets it first, it might take several minutes before you can search for that location again...it keeps showing that the appointment is available, but you'll try to use it and it says someone else already took it. So try another location until it resets. I found sites that scan for open appointments using bots, like [vaxxmax.com](https://vaxxmax.com), are simply too slow to be useful...they might update a couple minutes after an appointment opens up, but other people or bots are probably clicking repeatedly, so a new appointment will probably be gone after two seconds, and sites like vaxxmax just show it as open for a few minutes due to the way Rite Aid shows appointments as available even if it's been taken, or quasi-taken as someone is filling out the rest of their info.",4.0,error,0.0

I'm disinterested in my classes, and I am finding it so hard to motivate myself to do any school work... I'm procrastinating some things right now even... . I think its a hard decision to make. I'm all for promoting community college after high school and then transferring to a 4-year...it's what I did once I finally got back to school 3 years after high school, so that's generally where my bias is. However, you gotta do whats right for you. . . I'm skeptical whether the fall will be online or in-person. I know they day it'll all be in person but im still unsure. If it is in person, my advice really would be to try another semester because classes in person is SO different than with everything remote. I can't even imagine being a freshmen right now. Usually its in class or in clubs or during events that you meet other people but the only exposure you've had has been to your roommate and that just isn't normally what happens.. .

It can be a weight off your shoulders as far as responsibility goes... but if you have the ability to be in an apartment, ans prefer that. look around for subleases or people who need another roommate and meet someone new that way.

Look, I'm going into my senior year next year and I have been considering transferring almost every semester I have been here. I have been able to make incredible friends, but I do not think the strain this place has put on my mental health has been worth it and many times (especially now) I wish I went to somewhere, maybe anywhere, else. . . The way this school has reacted during the pandemic is appalling- all of my friends at other schools have better experiences. Michigan two semesters in a row promised some form of hybrid classes and both semesters I had no classes in person at all. I don't want to be negative/pessimistic- but Michigan could VERY much do this for fall semester. They know people will pay for this degree and they can kind of do whatever they want because of this.. . Michigan is a huge school, and it is very easy to get lost here. I have struggled with joining clubs/finding communities because although I want to be involved with those activities I am constantly overwhelmed with school and basically doing work all the time instead of branching out (I am an EECS major, to be fair lol). Yes, Michigan is a 'great degree' and blah blah blah- I worked at Microsoft last summer with students at Penn State, UMass Amherst, and many community colleges. Degrees are not that important, what's important is your mental health and happiness. This whole idea that you should ""rough it out"" for another semester is bullshit, I've been doing that the whole time I've been here and now it's really too late for me to transfer anywhere else. If you go somewhere that you feel you will be able to balance academics/social life and hobbies, you are going to be way better off than being miserable for a ""top-tier degree"". I completely disagree with anyone in these comments that say its worth it. Prioritize your well being. If you don't feel like this is the place for you, go somewhere else. You will be so much better off as a healthy graduate than an extremely burnt out and mental worn down graduate.. . Take it from someone who is exhausted from the competitive climate of this school. Academics are important-but lets be real. The past year of school has been a complete shit show-either classes are painfully easy or impossibly difficult for no reason. My opinion of a Michigan degree has diminished. Life is short, college should be an experience where you are challenged and grow, not watch your mental health disintegrate despite your best efforts.

Q: I heard that Michigan Medicine is disposing of leftover vaccinations at the end of the day, is that true?. . A: No. Michigan Medicine administers 100% of the doses they receive. If appointments are missed, and it appears doses will be available that need to be used by the end of the day, Michigan Medicine draws from a standing waitlist of people who have already received a vaccination invitation. Michigan Medicine also has vaccinated staff and volunteers at the vaccination clinic to ensure no doses are wasted.",28.0,neutral,0.8844828605651855

Last semester I had ChE 230 and MSE 220 but I also had two other classes that would have been on central, those being Econ 101 and Math 215. This semester it's two ChE classes and two other classes that again would have been on central. As I look at the rest of my four-year plan and what classes I have, the spread is looking to be about the same. Senior year is definitely more major-concentrated so you'd likely be spending more time on north by then. . . . General rundown, you'll at least spend a couple to a few hours on north MWF (since most lectures take place on those days) as a bare minimum to take classes, with an hour or two on Tuesday or Thursday for a lab or discussion. How much time you spend there besides for classes is entirely up to you. Do you like studying on central or on north? Are you going to have any commitments to Wilson Center teams or other engineering related organizations? It doesn't really matter where you live, whether it be on central or on north. Pick whichever one you like. I prefer central to north, and I've been able to live there for all my time here.",7.0,neutral,0.9022586345672607

The engineering core requires you to take more math and physics, and those additional math classes can prepare you for several of the popular upper level computer science electives (machine learning is a big one), or for a double major with another engineering discipline. The LSA curriculum might work better for minors outside of engineering (math, economics, statistics are popular minors for CS) because it has more flexibility with the non-major classes. In terms of jobs in the future, I heard one CSE guy say one time that it might make a difference just for your first job out of college but that's a biased source, the vast majority of people who look at your resume or transcript are gonna see ""Majored in computer science and went to University of Michigan"" you can beef up your resume with other stuff regardless of which one works out for you.",1.0,neutral,0.6739316582679749

I am very similar to you in that my entire undergrad, I did everything last minute. My undergrad institution was definitely not as hard as Michigan, but here are a few things that I recommend: . . 1. Try to schedule your classes in the afternoon. There's always people who say ""morning classes are better because I have the whole day after, blah blah blah"". But you know yourself well enough to know that morning classes just aren't it. I had only 2 9:30am classes in undergrad and I probably went to 50% or less of the lectures because it's just not how I operate. I typically tried to schedule my classes for 11am or later and it worked for the most part. The only I took the two earlier classes was because that was the only time they were offered. . . 2. Get a good planner. I may not be an early bird, and I do procrastinate, but I'm still organized. When you get your syllabi, put all the due dates in your planner that day. That way you don't procrastinate it. It might not make you start things earlier, but you'll definitely be aware of your assignments and due dates. . . Then, cross things off once they are submitted. Seeing the things that I have completed help me to see that I am accomplishing things, and seeing the list get smaller and smaller makes me feel less stressed. . . 3. Use your time between classes. Instead of going home or just going somewhere to hang out between classes, try to do as much work in the hour/ couple of hours between classes as you can. I would do little assignments here and there between classes that way I could focus on the bigger things at home and for longer. You could also use the time between classes to start projects and gradually work on them. . . For example, say you have an hour break on Tuesday/Thursday... if you do a little work on a big paper or project for an hour for two days a week you will have more done when you sit down to crank it out before the deadline. . . 4. Start projects early, even if you do the little things. I know this is what you were worried about from the OP but even just picking a topic and making an outline were small things I could do early that made the big projects a little less intimidating. . . . I know these are pretty general tips, but they are all things that helped me through my undergrad. Good luck!!. . Edit: as someone above said, use your resources!!! If you need help, go to office hours, email your professor, etc. This also helps your professor to know who you are and see that you are putting in an effort.",32.0,error,0.0

I have a few acquaintances who are directly involved with organizing the logistics of their vaccination delivery, as well as tracking their progress, and they are indeed administering all the doses they are given per week that very week, and sending scheduling invitation in the manner they describe on the web. So, I buy their explanation.. . I would reframe the take that ""they are two phases behind."" It's not like the county and the pharmacies have already successfully vaccinated everybody who belonged to previous phases outside of MM patient population either -- they just have no way of distinguishing between them once the eligibility is expanded. Since MM's is an invitation-based scheduling system, they are prioritizing sending scheduling invitations to people who qualified earlier and haven't already been vaccinated. (Note that the county is asking everybody 65+ who hasn't been vaccinated to call them directly rather than going through the online scheduler -- same idea.) I think it's appropriate, since MM has access to their patients' medical histories (by definition), and so can assess their comorbidities. I'd much rather have them doing this kind of assessment than the county health department or a store whose pharmacy I otherwise don't use -- especially since in just a week the latter will be giving shots to everybody, and not having to ask anything about your medical conditions. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people in the previously prioritized groups remain more vulnerable, and so if they have one more potential source of vaccines available to them than the rest of us, it's only fair.. . Finally, based on various announcements in the media and by officials, it seems that the vast majority of additional doses procured in recent weeks were purchased (and are being distributed) by the federal government, not the states. So, it's plausible that MM, which gets its doses from the state, has not been able to significantly increase their availability. OTOH, the retail pharmacies get their allocation from the feds, and the expansion in their capacity can be directly linked to the massive push on that level to secure more doses. (I would even speculate that, in light of this push, the states don't see the point in dedicating extra funds to increasing their purchasing commitments, since the federal investment will cover everybody soon enough.). . To sum up, I think the right strategy is to get on the MM waiting list, since you don't need to do anything else afterwards to remain in line, and meantime, check pharmacy websites periodically to see if an appointment becomes available at a time and location that you can make. This way, you'll get vaccinated as soon as you can, and have a small but non-zero chance of getting vaccinated in the Big House, which may have sentimental value for some folks -- just remember that the sentimental value does not outweigh the benefits of getting vaccinated sooner, even if it happens in an ""uninteresting"" place. :-)",1.0,error,0.0

Their website implied that they wouldn't get to me until August, but Schlissel keeps saying he wants staff back in ""spring"" (I'm using quotes because... aren't we in ""spring"" now? I'd love even a teeny ounce more of specificity from him!) The gap in those timelines left me very uncomfortable. I held out hope that during the March 12 COVID briefing we might get reassurance from someone in authority that the UM community would be prioritized so that we could achieve the goal of having a somewhat ""normal"" fall (plans currently rely heavily on faculty, staff, and GSIs being vaccinated), but I did not get that reassurance.

If you're looking at medschools you should aim for a *minimum* of >3.5 regardless of your major / institution (so choose wisely). 3. Medschools don't care about the prestige of your undergrad (if you went to Harvard or Yale or something Ivy-tier it \*might\* give you a leg up, but don't count on it).

In your first two years at Michigan, you need to take specific classes called prerequisites, and these vary based on major. For example, for cognitive science you need to take COGSCI 200, for economics you need to take ECON 101/ECON 102 and MATH 115, and for computer science you need to take the courses that u/ChaoticPalmTree mentioned. . . After you've taken those classes, you'll make an appointment with a CS advisor, which is a simple online process, and you'll spend 30 minutes talking to them about your plans to pursue computer science and classes you'll take to accomplish that. They'll change your major in the computer system from undeclared to computer science, and that's it. . . This summer, when you do freshman orientation, you'll meet with an advisor and they can help you choose your classes for the 2021-2022 year so you can stay on track.

It is Michigan's philosophy to let students choose to pursue what they want and not have to decide while they're still in high school. . . To declare a major, you just need to pass a set of prerequisites, generally in freshmen and sophomore year, with at least a C or C-. For computer science, I believe it's eecs 183/280/203 and math 115/116.

I personally can't justify getting a nursing degree paying out of state tuition (and acquiring the loans necessary). Everyone's situation is different, and you will figure out what works for you, but nursing is one of the few careers where the school you go to does not matter when it comes to applying for jobs and grad school. . . The nursing program here is really great, and the social community of umich is awesome, but paying $60k+ per year for the same classes you would take at an in-state school for half the cost is a tough sell. . . I know your question focused more on only going here for a year, but here are some things you should consider before committing anywhere:. - building a friend group in a new community can be very challenging, would you be able to uproot yourself and leave all the friends you have made after your freshman year due to finances? . - what if you can't make yourself leave after your first year due to the above factors? How will you pay for it?. - nursing schools can be very hard to apply/transfer into (as you well know). Would you need to apply as a transfer student at a different school back home after your first year? I think this would add a lot of stress, and you'll need to make sure your classes can transfer. The program here is very structured and lock-step, so switching schools and taking breaks can be more complicated than with other majors.. - will you be taking a large amount of loans and/or depleting your college savings to come here for one year? If so it might be wiser in the long run to choose a different school and allow your money to get you further! . - what is it that makes you want to come to umich so badly? Are you able to get those things (social aspect, specific academic programs, etc) at a school more in your price range? . . Make sure to look at salaries for your goal post-grad nursing job and compare them to the amount of loans you'd need to take to come here. For me, it would be nearly impossible to come in knowing you'll have to transfer in a year, but it might be different for you.

I actually entered Michigan in LSA as a pre-Med student and then transferred into the nursing school, so I know a little bit about that. . I'd encourage you to look up ""Umich nursing sophomore transfer program"" to get more information directly from the source, but essentially you could transfer after your freshman year.. Because the nursing program is so lock-step, (you can look at Umich nursing website for program plans) you can only transfer in as a sophomore. This means that no matter how many years/credits of college you have already taken, you will have 3 more years once you are accepted into the nursing program here.. So you could do your first and/or second year at a cheaper university and then transfer here, but you would be committing to 3 years of out of state tuition.. You also do need to reapply to be a sophomore transfer. There's some required pre-req classes that you need to have taken, and you submit 2 Essays (why Umich nursing, and community essay, same as original app) and your resume. They also HIGHLY value clinical experience when evaluating transfer students for admission, so trying to work as a CNA or home health aide or other position would benefit you if you decide to do that. Shadowing and other non-paid healthcare experience is also beneficial! It can be selective for the sophomore transfer program because they only take as many seats as are available in each class (usually each nursing class is maxed at 200, about 50 transfer student got into the nursing school in my cohort). You did already get into umich nursing once though, so I have no doubts that you can do it again.. I hope that made sense and I am happy to help!

But to be honest, it doesn't seem incredibly likely; your waitlists from Notre Dame/UNC/UCLA/Michigan would seem to apply that you're not necessarily one of the strongest students at Michigan in the first place. Which shouldn't discourage you from attending if you're admitted, of course, but is something to consider when evaluating your prospects for Ross. . . If you wouldn't be happy here in LSA, then you shouldn't attend banking on admission to Ross--nobody should. If you're dead-set on finance, rather than dead-set on Michigan (and it *is* possible in LSA; a lot of students do math and econ.

Both work directly with students facing crisis situations and housing/financial instability, and might be able to help at least guide you to the resources that you need for the immediate future. Emergency funds exist (though they may be cramped down right now because of COVID) and they can at least help you prep for housing costs, switching phone plans, etc. . . After that, I'd call financial aid, explain the situation, and ask to re-submit your documents as an independent for an appeal. This would exclude your parents' income and will result in some need-based scholarships that could at least help to cover some of tuition (unless you personally own a massive amount of stocks/work at a Fortune 500 while in college, which isn't likely). . . Finally, email your professors. You don't have to give specifics, but explain that there is currently a 'family crisis' and that your asssignments for the near future may be late as a result. If you get them all in on-time, props to you, but when my life fell apart, it was nice to have the wiggle room.

I don't blame you for that. If you love what you do and have a passion for it you can be successful. It's much more rewarding to be doing a job every day that you enjoy rather than one that gives you money.

Then you contact the instructor and tell them you are interested in auditing the class. (You might actually want to do that before you take the first step, to make sure they are open to audits in the first place.) This prompts a discussion of what activities they expect auditing students to participate in (e.g., attend lectures and labs, participate in classroom discussions, but not submit homeworks or take exams -- but each instructor has their own approach). If you are both on board, you request, and the instructor approves, to have your grading for the course changed to ""VI"" (for visitor). You get the same access to canvas, piazza, office hours, etc., as other enrolled students (since you *are* an enrolled student), and the class appears in your transcript with a ""Visitor"" notation instead of a grade.. . The caveat is that you are officially enrolled in the class, so if you are a part-time student paying tuition per-credit, it will be reflected in your bill. So, I see why you wouldn't want to do it. You can still approach the instructor and ask if you can participate as an unregistered visitor in some capacity. They may allow it. But be prepared and respectful if they say no. Some instructors are uncomfortable sharing some of their class resources outside of the enrolled student body. In some cases, like when the resources include lecture recordings in which other students' voices and faces are visible, it could be considered a FERPA infringement. I know that CoE in general frowns upon this (in part because you are using instructor's time and attention and other course resources without paying tuition for it, and because the instructor/department does not get credit for having an extra student enrolled in their class). Moreover, next semester specifically, if you plan to attend lectures or office hours, the official enrollment info will still be used to track room density and contact tracing due to COVID, so having unregistered visitors will be particularly problematic. . .

For the past few years ever before COVID, I've signed leases and subleases in the last few months of summer and have loved the experience. Much cheaper housing and room to negotiate with people subleasing and there is ALWAYS HOUSING AVAILABLE. Keep in mind I get housing on central campus solo without roommates and am flexible to whether I can get a highrise or a smaller building. My main priority is low cost and the best way from my 3 years experience is to not rush the signing process. The big companies want people to panic sign at their higher rates and push this narrative that housing is scarce when it really isn't. Yes the comment above is correct that housing options won't be as plentiful for your perfect housing situation. But it is well worth it in my opinion to wait and either take a sublease from another student (many students on the facebook marketplace constantly needing people to take leases) or signing a full lease near the start of the semester where many apartment companies have students changing housing situations and need leases filled to avoid dead costs (better rates).",0.0,neutral,0.5475866198539734

FIND FINANCIAL HELP such as an ROTC scholarship, other military scholarship, wait till you're 24 to finish your degree (can be independent from parent income aka financial aid will fully cover your costs).

It has a good dining hall and great study areas if you don't want to study in your room all the time.. . -Access to research projects & networking (though this could be done through UROP). MRADS gives you access to tons of research projects, which can give you a jump start on research experience. Also, presenting your work at the end of the year is kind of fun (they had good food too).. . -Meeting other freshman who are interested in research.

My peer mentor didn't care about his group at all and mostly became a peer mentor so he could live with his friends. Advisor wasn't bad, but we just didn't click. They did provide good resume advice and email writing advice, but that was about it.. . -There are mandatory events/classes you have to go to, most of which are boring. Some do have food where you can chill and talk to people, but the ALA class was super boring and not useful.. . -It can be hard to make friends within the community. Everyone has their own schedule and interests so it can be hard to meet up with people at events. Also, it might've just been my cohort, but people didn't really go out if their way to meet new people. Small 4-5 groups of friends formed and it was kind of hard to get into that circle.

Let's be clear--I'm not saying THIS professor was right, especially if all she was objecting to was her own students watching her lecture asynchronously. However, I want to ask students to consider that professors may have some reasons that they don't want their class materials circulating openly.. . I know of several cases where a faculty member used another's slides, concepts, and assignments without permission and passed it off as their own work. In one case, it was used to get an invitation to present at a conference. At another, they used at part of the faculty's dossier to bolster their recruitment by a top school. This was unethical and hopefully not common, but can fuel concerns about IP.. . This can be an especially critical issue for instructors who are contingent (adjuncts or lecturers) and get hired each term or year with no promise of ongoing employment. Their teaching assignments might be dependent on the fact that they have a special expertise in the course they are assigned. If their materials are treated like public access materials, then their future employment is less secure.. . Despite all this, many instructors are highly collaborative and share their materials. They post syllabi for all to see, and make access to their slides and lecture recordings. This is the ideal.

You are correct, pre-admit does NOT guarantee admission, it only means ""interest"", which we don't know what that means. Don't get complacent and work hard to differentiate yourself when applying. Here's my old post:**. . I am in the UX program as a BSI student with a CS minor. Senior this year, doing the 1-year master's next year.. . UX blends in topics of visual design (think illustrator/logo/art), interaction design (actual user experience workflows), psychology (cognitive/social), and communication (when you actually conducting user research in the form of interviewing users, analyzing+aggregating+synthesizing the data you collect, advocating for your designs when working across with other people).. . At the end of the day, UX people at real companies can handle a wide variety of actual needs. This can be good or bad for you depending on what you want to do. For example, you might be designing only, doing design and research, designing and coding, etc. The job requirements vary greatly.. . As a student studying UX, you have to be hauling ass outside of school. The classes in the School of Information are good and EASY, but they only give you the bare foundations required to start learning. You should be working on side projects, learning about design from online communities, and carving your professional path as soon as you start the program. Solely coasting through the classes will get you nowhere. (Median grade for every SI class is either A- or A), pretty inflated so you can recruit better.. . Careers, this is interesting. It really depends on what kind of role fits you, in addition to what you study and prepare for of course. I've been studying design and plan on continuing to study design. For winter recruiting, I successfully recruited for 1 design internship for the winter semester which I did not accept. However, for the past 5 months for summer recruiting, I've been recruiting for design roles with varying levels of success, but earned no final offer in design. Instead, I've had success with product roles- I think my communication skills in conjunction with my design/CS foundation made me realize that product management is a better fit for me. . .

And that makes sense because the closer you get to graduation, the less flexibility you have to take a class another term.. . The problem was, if you were a student who came in without a AP or IB credits, you would always--every single term--be the last person in your cohort to register.

If a college prices all credits exactly the same, then they are essentially subsidizing the more expensive and specialized higher level classes with the tuition from lower level classes. That's fine and good if everybody stays four years because it evens out--so at UM this might be good. But it's not fair for students who leave without graduating. They end up overspending for those initial early credits, without enjoying the price break this earned them for the upper division courses. And you have campuses we're almost half the students don't graduate.. . I think sometimes people assume that if a college eliminated the difference between lower and upper division, that means the lower division price rate would be charged all four years.

You are continuing to make progress towards graduation, and you will continue to be privileged above students with fewer credits than you. But just without credits you got via tests. I completely get why this hits you harder, and the fact that it fails to recognize that you could be very close to graduation but the registration system will still treat you like you're one year away from it. I get it.. . The problem is not that your entering cohort was competing with you for the classes that they needed. So no, everyone in your entering class who is fighting for place in calculus II (for example) was not competing against you for that spot because you don't need calculus II.. . The problem is that they were competing with everyone in their cohort who DID need a spot in Calc II, and when going for classes like this they were getting the last registration slot every single term. One term it might be Calc II, another term it might be some other required class for their major. . . And it's not even about whether or not you can graduate, although that's pretty huge. UM does not have a huge problem with people being unable to graduate on time. (Yes, someone trying to graduate early may face deeper challenges). Another issue, Pepsi's a bigger one, is that students without that AP boost had a harder time putting together a desired schedule, a harder time getting a preferred professor, a harder time picking the lab or discussion that works best with their schedule, and a very limited chance of getting a popular elective. Maybe they couldn't double major or earn a minor because of this. They may have been able to graduate on time, but every single term they were enrolled in Michigan, they had more limited choices in the schedule they put together.. .

I did not get in off the waitlist, and my general experience with being waitlisted to things is that it's a whole lot of worrying about the decision of an entity which is not interested in respecting your time. I'd say, wait for your third response, figure out what financial aid you'd be getting from the colleges that accepted you, pick one, and move on with your life. Go to a different college. It'll be fine. You'll make friends, you'll learn shit, you'll have a good time, and you'll still pay way too much money no matter where you end up.. . And hey, if the other university isn't a good fit for you, you can always transfer somewhere different- maybe back here. I did, and things turned out just fine.. . Fundamentally, it'll be fine. You'll be fine. Worrying about getting in off the waitlist is not a good time, and it really won't get you anywhere.

The economics department is dysfunctional and has been for quite a while now. I took 401 last semester and my Prof. openly talked with us about how they don't have enough professors to satisfy the demand for economics courses. At the same time, they refuse to open up seats for popular classes like ULWR electives that most econ majors rely on in order to graduate and fulfill major requirements. I emailed the dept. asking about whether or not they were planning to open up more ULWR seats and they just told me to join the waitlist. This was extremely annoying considering last semester the dept. head sent an email to all econ students saying that barely anyone drops ULWR courses so don't miss the registration window:. . >*For seniors, I strongly recommend registering for ULWR ECON electives right when your registration starts. If you postpone your registration, sometimes even for a few hours, you may end up on the waitlist and you may not be able to take the class at all because these classes are in high demand and students don't drop them in large numbers*.. . Overall, just extremely frustrated with the current situation. I'm going to be a senior next year and I got into none of the upper-level electives I wanted to take. Wasn't this supposed to get better as your grade level increased? Although I think the registration change is clearly for the better and I support it, it definitely didn't help my registration situation since I lost 8 credit hours.

Note that I get being frustrated, but I'm trying to temper this notion that it is an absolute fact that it is your proximity to graduation that should be the most important factor for scheduling priority.. . In the world where AP credits contribute to scheduling, a student loaded with AP credits will get a far better value for their money than a student with no AP credits. It's obvious why the student with AP credits would want that. But as schools like Michigan work to become more inclusive and increase socioeconomic diversity on campus (it is a public school after all), it's not at all obvious that Michigan should be going out of their way to give you a better value rather than giving you and the student without AP credits (closer to, at least) equal value, which is what they're doing by increasing your scheduling priority. Especially when you getting a seat in that class you want could cause the person in the class ahead of you without those AP credits to delay graduation, or take an ""inferior"" class schedule.. . I can say that from the conversations I've been privy to with faculty/staff in the EECS department (where registration is known to be a mess every semester due to demand) I think the overwhelming majority of faculty would rather create an inclusive environment where anyone, even someone starting from the bottom in terms of credits and experience, could have a positive experience while getting a world-class education in four years, rather than sacrificing the experiences of those students to make it easier for students with a head start to graduate in three.

Some of the benefits of our community are:. . * We are really social, and are very focused on bonding and making friends with unique interests. Even throughout covid we have been doing weekly socially distanced hikes, walks to get bubble tea together, virtual game nights, and studio ghibli movie nights. * We are located in Bursley on North Campus which a lot of us really enjoy because it is quieter and close to nature (we have multiple groundhogs that are our unofficial mascots). * We get funding to do cool projects like make dice out of resin, or a geodesic dome out of paper. Some of these things you are \*required\* to do as a part of the community engagement, but there is such a broad range of stuff you can choose from that all of it is really fun and you are bound to find something you enjoy. * We have access to the creative suite, which is basically a living arts dedicated lounge and maker space/tools. * You can meet a really diverse group of people that are all interested in different technical creative things, we have a lot of friends that are in STAMPS (the art school) but have been learning how to code, or a lot of engineers that are really interested in drawing and music (and just people interest in everything). . Requirements of the community. . * Monthly meetings that last an hour, you get to hear some guest speakers talk about some cool creative thing, and while they aren't great they aren't bad and everyone goes to them together. * Workshops lead by peer mentors. You have to go to at least two a semester, they are a couple hours long, but there are so many fun and cool things available to do for them that me and most of my friends have well exceeded the minimum requirement. Examples of some we had this year (dice making, friendship bracelet making, basic and advanced arduino, resin dice making, recorder workshop, raspberry pi, origami, intro to drawing, etc). * Creative collaborative project (CCP), its a project in which people in LAE from different disciplines get together and are given funding to make whatever they want based on a given prompt, these are presented at the end of the year. * UARTS 150 is the only required course for LAE, freshmen take it their first semester. (I think most of the other communities have multiple classes) It is pretty cool, you get to make a video game, and it is generally a good bonding experience as everyone in LAE takes it in one section together at the same time. (If you were not in engineering it would count for the first year writing requirement). . As the other person said, we're doing an info session on Sunday at 8pm.

It's by far the more rigorous and prestigious school. . . I have a similar mindset right now-- I would definitely choose a less expensive option if any of them were even comparable in quality to Michigan, but based on the data I can find it seems like Michigan's outcomes and typical ROI might make it worth the cost. The CoE data paints a really good picture for graduate outcomes. But I'm trying my best to be objective.. . . . > Have you factored in cost of living differences between the cities? Where are you planning to work after graduation? . . Honestly, I don't know much about the cost of living in Ann Arbor vs. Tallahassee beyond the room/board of the universities. I imagine Ann Arbor is more expensive? If you have any anecdotal experience you could share I would honestly appreciate it, cause I hadn't thought about it much before. . . Obviously it's too early to say for sure exactly where I'll end up working after graduation, but right now I would love to work in Chicago (I'm from Illinois) or somewhere in the Northeast (Boston, NY, Philadelphia). However, I'm not going to totally discount the idea of Silicon Valley cause those paychecks are pretty attractive, especially in the context of student debt lol. Basically, I expect to live/work in a city, so pretty high cost of living.. . . . > What's your plan to turn $23k/year into 30 or 40k overall, rather than $92k? . .

I don't think you can compare this to an upper level CS class here. Sure, you may see the same algorithms being used, but one class'd likely tell you to implement a basic version of the algorithm, while the other has a decent amount of math homework in it on top of a programming assignment. One'd give you the general idea of how the algorithm works (and tbh I prefer StatQuest for this, they have great opening jingles), while the other may go into the weeds with matrix calculus. . . That's not to say the Coursera class isn't useful. I think it's great for getting intuition, and would help you not miss the random forest for the trees. I do, however, think that taking either EECS 445 or 545 would still very challenging. Often people have a very surface-level understanding of ML algorithms. You can decide to stop there, or you can learn about how and why it all works. And often, learning how and (a bit of) why the algorithms you learn about in class work involves calculating gradients of log-likelihood functions, implementing convolutional layers from scratch with NumPy black magic, or showing that the primal and dual formulation of SVM are equivalent. (This is just the surface, there's a lot more you won't learn about in a first ML class). . . How much probability, statistics and linear algebra have you done, and do you have calc 3? If so, maybe Stanford's CS229 ~may~ be somewhat accessible to you, and you could do that over the Coursera class. Lectures are available online, and so are the problem sets -- just google them. If you can deal with that, then you could consider going ahead and taking EECS 545. A good number (dare I say half?) of the problems in that class are taken from CS229 anyway (there's a good reason for that, the current 545 professor used to be Andrew Ng's PhD student and taught the class at Stanford), so you wouldn't be doing the CS229 assignments for nothing. . . Full disclosure: I took neither of EECS 445 or the Coursera class, did 545 instead. I did, however, look up a 445 problem set, read a few 445 slides, watched a couple of Andrew Ng's videos, and looked at the Coursera assignments to make sure I wasn't talking out of my ass completely.",1.0,error,0.0

That is, starting with mostly in-person, and adjusting as needed. For people who are vaccinated, the risk may be along the lines of a normal seasonal flu.. . By then, most everyone who wants a vaccination is vaccinated, with rare exeptions for medical reasons, and that considerably reduces the risk of serious harm to vaccinated people if there's some low level transmission of Covid going on. Concern for the welfare of people who choose to be unvaccinated is going to be secondary. The main concern about the anti-vaxxers for the rest of us is that they're going to extend higher infection rates and keep pressure on hospitals longer, but it shouldn't be anywhere near the crisis level we're experiencing right now.. . There is still ongoing discussion within Michigan's universities about whether to require students and/or faculty/staff to be vaccinated this fall; I'd bet against it at U-M, but it could go either way. Nearby Oakland University is requiring all students *living on campus* this fall to be vaccinated, I think with medical or religious exceptions, and I could see U-M adopting a compromise like that.. . In terms of variants, I think the currently dominant B.1.1.7 will give way to P.1 or another variant with the E484K mutation, which spread better in people with immune responses from vaccinations or prior infections. But moderate to severe symptoms will still be greatly reduced by those immune responses, which is why many epidemiologists predict Covid will gradually become another seasonal illness like colds and flus that we just learn to accept.

In terms of experience with different majors, the Engr 110 (not required) class allows you to explore what the different majors offer, though I'm not sure if there is a lot of hands-on experience in that class. On the contrary, Engr 100 is required, and allows you to be really hands-on with a single topic, with each section of the course being a different topic. Here is the link to explore the different sections: https://eng100.engin.umich.edu/. If I was going to pick your classes in a way that allows you the most time to explore, I would take Engr 101 (Intro to programming) and Engr 110 Fall Semester and Engr 100 in spring semester, filling in your other classes as you need. Additionally, you don't have to declare until the end of your fall semester, so you could probably take a major-specific course your Fall semester if you are still unsure.. . I'm on the Solar Car team and highly recommend joining any project team your Freshman year. They can be pretty time consuming, and it's definitely a situation of you get out what you put in, so the more time, the more rewarded you're gonna feel, imo. You could 100% put a project as experience on your resume when applying to jobs and things. If you weren't taking a huge amount of credits, then you could probably also do research, but that is going to come down to how good of a time manager you are.. . Another thing on getting internships/research, being on project teams really helps you network. Sponsors of your team will likely have internships over the summer, people on the teams will have internship opportunities available through people they know, etc. Finally, one thing that we do on the solar car (I can't confirm that other teams do/don't do this, but you may want to reach out to them and ask) is talk to our alumni very frequently. This is actually how I got an internship for this summer, through a connection with an alumni of the solar car team, and I found out later that the only way that you could get an application was through someone who already worked there. . .

And about half of our international students are from China, India, and south Korea so there is a good community for you to get connected with. . . [Here](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/) is the international center page where you can find out about resources for getting connected with other international students. There is a monthly coffee hour as well as birthday celebrations through the international center to help international students with some of that acclimating to a new environment.. . They also do international student lunch conversation events monthly, I believe, through CAPS that is specifically for international students that provide lunch and activities and meet up (obviously been a little more difficult with zoom, but they're hoping it'll be in person in the fall).

t1_gu6fdmf,2021-04-11 19:48:49,t3_m0l37o,t3_m0l37o,"I think I really messed up. I originally tried to have a somewhat of a chill semester by only taking eecs 281 and two other easy classes so I can concentrate on mastering eecs 281 which will be very important in all the future classes. However, I found myself just simply not in the mental state to grind eecs 281 and end up with failing project grades to the point now that I will guarantee to fail the class. Luckily, I signed up for few mini courses around the middle of the semester so I will still have 12 credits to end the semester with. But I am just in a deep regret that I did not try harder in eecs 281 and it was honestly the only remotely difficult class I have. It was a great opportunity and a great amount of time to master this one single class that will be very important in the future.. . Also I felt like I should've taken another eecs class like eecs 370 or eecs 376 along such that if I failed one of them I still have another class on the belt to make progress with my requirements. Even if I fail both I will still have a better idea of what they are like in the future so both classes will be easier in the future. Instead, I naively thought I should just have an easy schedule and thought I can concentrate in one class and do well but end up messing everything up. I made zero progress towards my eecs requirements this semester even I might have had a solid grasp of most of the eecs 281 concepts as I didn't do too poorly on the midterm; it was just the projects that I was failing because one small thing did not work so the entire project does not work. Part of the reason that I failed eecs 281 and was not in the mind to do it because I went out too much this semester and just had trouble concentrating on school work in general because of all the distractions. I really should have grinded this semester so I can enjoy my first in person semester when everything starting to go back to normal next semester.. . I am really in deep regret that I did not try harder with eecs 281 this semster and now have to retake it. I also regret not taking full advantage of the covid grading system and attempt other eecs classes so I will either have reassurance that I will make progress or I will have a preview of what it will be like next semester. My initial plan of attempting to fully concentrate on DS and Alg really failed because I had trouble focusing.. . Now what should I do? I am considering taking 370 along with another course in the spring as as full time spring student so I can stay ahead of my schedule and so I don't have to pay 8k for one class but can instead pay 12k for up to 9 credits. Else, I can also take 370 at UIUC which will be around 4k. My other plan is to take stats 250 at some community college just to get things out of the way.. . I am also considering taking both eecs 281 and 370 in the fall and leave 376 for the future. I can also take 370 in the spring and leave 376 and 281 together in the fall. My last resort will be taking 370 and 376 and 281 at the same time as I basically know most of the material in 281 and just grind hard.. . I really messed up with my classes and did not fully take advantage of all the stuff I could've done. Ideally if I took 370 and 281 this semester and passed all of them, I can already take ULCS classes my fall semester as a sophomore, which will be great as it will set me up for great amount of schedule flexibility. It also allow me to take as many ULCS classes as possible to sharpen my skill. However, not only this did not happen, I failed 281 alone, which is truly tragic.. .

I showed up to the mass meetings of several teams - for sure STARX, MFly, MAAV, and MRacing, but probably one or two others - not 100% sure whether I went to MASA or MRover or not, it's been a while. I'm pretty sure I ended up going to a few regular meetings of two of these teams, but at this point I can't remember which - maybe STARX and MAAV? . . Basically, the one common theme I heard at all of these meetings were people on other project teams talking about how much the people on the Solar Car team worked, which really let me know the Solar Car team had a reputation for dedication and passion and pushed me to eventually go give it a try when I'd heard that at enough places. I'm a super ""Type B"" person, but I also was specifically hoping to find a team where people were really expected to put in the time and effort to be the leaders and best. So, even though I was three or four weeks behind the ""normal"" recruiting cycle, I showed up to a Solar Car meeting for the first time and had to figure out which division to try out. . . At the time, I had imagined it would be most likely for me to pursue mechanical engineering, but I wasn't discounting electrical or computer science (I had been the programming lead on my high school FRC team, which I did enjoy, but I was pretty sure I didn't want to make a career out of it unless I hated my other options). Thus, when I heard that the team's Microsystems division had come out of recruitment a bit understaffed, I figured I'd give it a try. . . Turns out, I loved it, and ended up applying to and being selected for our 2019 Race Crew, so I worked all summer building our newest car and then went to Australia in the fall to race it in the World Solar Challenge, where we ultimately took third place. This was a fantastic experience, and frankly I wouldn't be surprised if it's the highlight of my entire life (although I do hope to do something that tops it someday, I guess). . . I've met so many people through Solar Car and have learned so many things way ahead of my classes that it's hard to imagine where I'd be without it. I'm currently on track to begin a Masters program and then seek employment in Embedded Systems, which is basically just pursuing what I do on the team professionally, and my experiences with the team have given me a huge leg up in finding internships over others my age and experience level. . . Ultimately, I know that not all of this will apply to you - not everybody does pretty much exactly what they want to do for their job every day on their project team, and frankly not everybody needs to. But I will let you know that we do have mechanical, aerospace, and strategy (Data Science-ish) divisions, so Solar Car in particular would not be a bad place to give one, two, or all three a try and see what sticks with you the most. I personally recommend it if you want a team where everybody truly puts in all of their effort to try to be the best on the world stage, if the idea of designing a solar-powered car sounds cool, if you'd like to go race the car in Australia in 2023, or if you just want a great way to become friends with some of the most dedicated engineers on campus.",4.0,error,0.0

Most transfer students have to adjust to the rigor of umich classes regardless of their major, but it helps a lot to have an interest in what you're studying. And you don't need much of a math background, but they do require calc 1 and an intro stats class.",2.0,neutral,0.5866335034370422

t1_gu7xxri,2021-04-12 04:05:01,t3_mp2bhz,t3_mp2bhz,"I lived in a single in South Quad last year as a sophomore and I loved it. I had a really bad roommate as a freshman and I would have moved off campus the next year instead but it didn't work out. So I went with the single and I thought it was great. For context though, I'm pretty introverted and just generally don't like people so I kept to myself. I might have talked to people in my hall two times at most and didn't interact with anybody I didn't have to. I didn't get lonely though, it was awesome to have some privacy (especially with a gf) and I was able to set up the room exactly how I wanted it. If that stuff sounds important to you then I definitely recommend it and I think it's worth the price. However, I also think there's something to be said for the college experience of living with a random roommate. I think either way it's not the end of the world",1.0,positive,0.7970331907272339
