7567,"281 is one of the hardest classes you‚Äôll take as a CS major, but don‚Äôt worried it gets better from here. I got a C in 281, & a C- followed by a C in 370. However these weed out classes don‚Äôt define you as a student.

From here on, you take upper levels, where the assignments are much more specialized & fun. I went from the grades I mentioned, to A‚Äôs in 442, 485, 692 & other classes. I‚Äôve had internships 2 FAANG internships, & even got into Grad School with a 3.3 GPA.

You are meant to be here, you were accepted for a reason, and be wary of imposter syndrome like is mentioned in every class. Trust me, you‚Äôre on your way up, & all that matters is you try to figure out how to become a better test taker.

I went from being around or below average on exams, to above average in grad school. The difference? After undergrad I took a seriously look at how I was studying & changed it.

I graduated near top of my class with my BSE  and rolled that into my MSE in aero. Not sure what class it was for my MSE but i completely bombed everything. Homework‚Ä¶bombed. Tests‚Ä¶. bombed. Shock to my system because I had never gotten below say a 70 on a test and I was looking at a 40 in the class or something.  It was like a foreign language. Somehow got a passing grade and moved on. 

Been in industry for 10+ years now, feel like I‚Äôve been very successful. Changed industries but that was by choice.

GPA doesn‚Äôt really determine whether you get into the top companies or any company for that matter in our industry. What matters is do you understand the material? Do you know how to assess a CS problem with respect to date structures and algorithms (important for those technical interviews). Do you know how to implement a project from spec details? Do you know how to play well with teammates (more of an EECS 280 thing but you get my point). All these things are more important than that letter grade.

7575,"After you graduate you will be hired and making money, living  and enjoying life, and none of this will matter.  The stuff they throw at you in UM CS is diabolical, stuff you will most likely never see again. Hopefully it just makes you battle tested, deepens your understanding of what is possible, fills your toolbox with solutions, and teaches you how to use every resource you can find to devise a good solution to the problems that come your way. For most business applications, your knowledge is already better than most in the field. 

As far as your path in life, I guess it all depends on what you do, but I don't think yours if permanently changed because of this.  Or if it is, maybe the one you thought wasn't really a great fit after all.  Be kind to yourself, getting through that class is an accomplishment.

7579,"By definition a C grade is passing and indicates adequate performance in the course. Getting a C grade in EECS 281 therefore means you ARE cut out for UM Computer Science. Also consider that 281 is widely regarded as one of the hardest CS courses in the whole CS department. You did great, you didn't need a retake, you can move forward towards upper level CS and never look back. Be proud of yourself.",12/23/22,1004,-1,-1,
7580,"It can be pretty tough getting your first low grade, especially when you‚Äôve done well in all your classes your whole life. But it‚Äôs going to be ok and your academic career is not ruined. Umich engineering can be quite unkind to GPAs but that‚Äôs not a knock on your aptitude to the field. I believe I got a C in differential equations my freshman year. I was worried I wasn‚Äôt going to pass but I did. Everything ended up being fine. I managed to graduate cum laude and got a job in the field of my major.",12/23/22,1004,-1,1,
7581,"You passed the class! That means that the professors do believe that you did enough to show competence and move forward with the computer science curriculum. Not to mention, that you got an A average on the projects which is no small feat! IMO exams, especially ones where you have to write code with pencil and paper, aren't as good as a measure of your computer science ability. They need some way to test you, but it doesn't really well translate to real-world programming with how you can just Google everything.  

281 is not an easy class. It's a big step up from 280, and depending on what upper levels you take, it could very well be the hardest CS class you take at Michigan. There are definitely harder classes (such as 482) that can continue to push you, but in general, I feel like the difficulty of the CS program starts to plateau after 281. The other thing is that when there's a big increase in difficulty between classes, not everyone can excel on the first try because people learn different things at different rates. One of my 281 IAs didn't do well in the class himself but was able to pick up the skills later and well, was able to be competent enough to be an IA while he was still a student.   

Also, GPA is honestly pretty overrated. Most employers don't care nearly as much as you think, especially once you graduate. Grad schools care to an extent, but less so for PhDs and it can be made up in other ways, especially if you have strong research experience or choose to spend time in industry first. It can be easy to forget that Michigan Computer Science is a very good, yet tough program, so just being able to get through it means a lot to companies. I've had friends with lower GPAs (even below 3) that still ended up working at great tech companies and are super happy with their lives now.  

So congrats on passing the class! That's definitely something not everyone can do. And please don't be deterred by your grades, every successful person faces setbacks. I'm sure your future is bright and I wish you the best of luck on the rest of the cs program. You got this!",12/23/22,1004,-1,1,

1. During the class, teaching assistants are actually not allowed to develop relationship with students. This is a protection on you to make sure that the relationship is not ruled impropely by one part. This is a very serious rules of conduct that all instructors and teaching assistants need to follow. 
2. There is a case that a report is sufficient. If the teaching assistant and a student forms the relationship (either current or ex-couple) before the class starts, then TA needs to report it to the instructor. The basic idea is to avoid the interaction between this TA and this student.
3. From your side, really, you should keep in mind that it is IA's **job responsibility** to handle discussions and help you with the work. Please do think about whether your like is beyond his responsibility or not.

If you're wondering, I didn't speak to the police without representation and nothing came of it. Everyone else plead out for lesser charges regardless of guilt. Mine was dropped at the first court date after arraignment.   


But I got a real good look of what life after a formal accusation/conviction would be like. It aint pretty. Even for people who didn't do something many would see as 'morally' wrong or was falsely accused.

10745,"I am not disagreeing with you, at all, about Peter Chen. That said, I do think that you're overstating a few arguments and ignoring some crucial differences, as a general matter. 

""Beyond a reasonable doubt"" is not quantified in any U.S. court system (at least, none that I am aware of as a lawyer). For some jurors, ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" means they must be 90% sure that someone committed a particular offense; for others it may mean 75% sure. The only metric that everyone agrees on is that ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" is a stricter burden than ""preponderance of the evidence,"" which is just ""more likely than not"" in layman's terms. In other words, if every member of a jury is about 75% sure that a defendant committed a crime, and they all personally quantify ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" as something more than 75%, then the defendant will be found not guilty. In contrast, civil cases use the preponderance of the evidence standard. The U.S. civil system is based on the idea that ""more likely than not"" is sufficient to deprive people of their money or property. There's far more nuance here of course, but your OJ example is not an outlier at all. Again, this is an oversimplification, but if I (as hypothetical victim) can, in a civil battery case, prove with 50.000001% certainty that you punched me and caused me injuries, and a prosecutor can also prove that in a criminal case with the same 50.000001% certainty, then you would be liable to me for damages but face no criminal penalties. 

In terms of when someone should face employment consequences for being accused of a crime, I truly don't know what the correct answer is. But I certainty don't think that, if ""more likely than not"" is enough for one to lose money or property, then ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" is the only standard by which one can lose your job. Our criminal justice system is designed to ensure that the government is least able to punish the innocent, even if that means some guilty go unpunished. That same standard should not, and generally does not, apply to situations without the possibility of criminal sanctions‚Äîwith the caveat that for Peter Chen, I understand a body of the government is the employer as well.",1/13/23,1533,10735,0,

Near the end it talks about a study where they tried to corroborate recovered memories and found -

‚ÄúMany examples of corroborated recovered memories can be found at the Recovered Memory Project (Cheit, 1998; www.recoveredmemory.org). That said, the context in which the memories were recovered does matter. A study by Geraerts et al. (2007) found that 45% of survivors with continuous memories, 37% of survivors with temporarily inaccessible memories, and 0% of those who had recovered memories through suggestive therapy were able to obtain corroboration for their memories.‚Äù

Of course ‚Äúnot corroborated‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúfalse‚Äù, but 0% in the above study is pretty damning.

From the everything I‚Äôve been able to gather from the trial it appears the accuser‚Äôs recovered memories surfaced as part of suggestive therapy, and she clearly had doubts that they were real.

Many relevant details of what transpired there couldn't be revealed or asked about in the Chen case because of medical confidentiality, but informally it sounds like a sort of boot camp that applies extreme behavioral modification techniques to try and change unwanted behaviors that can occur due to mental illness or other issues. Some camp survivors come away allegedly suffering from PTSD. The practices in the case of the accuser seemed to include weekly therapy sessions using widely discredited techniques for creating and reinforcing recovered memories of sexual abuse.

Prior to double majoring, I met with the financial aid office staff and my academic advisor to ensure that my financial aid wouldn't be affected if I declared a second major. All of them said that I would be fine so long as I met the requirements for financial aid- and I did. As soon as I declared a second major, my University of Michigan Grant was taken away because I was only allowed to satisfy academic requirements for one major.

I did ask the financial aid office if I could receive financial aid again if I revoked my second major but was told no because I had already taken classes for the second major. I had started taking classes for my second major during the winter term; therefore, my financial aid was impacted for the following year.

I ended up going from 24-27k a year in financial aid with the University of Michigan Grant to a 5k Pell Grant + student loans.

My real point about 40 or 50 years is that it's a long time compared to how you'll be a college student. Even if you have to add an extra year to graduate because you changed majors and had to start over, if that gets you a degree in something you'd actually like to do with your life versus something you don't, that is a pretty good move.",2/20/23,2241,14445,1,

I decided to take all the classes here at Umich cause I wanted to challenge myself and as an out of state student I felt I wanted to take the challenging courses here where I‚Äôm paying so much money. 

Linear algebra was one of my favorite courses here (Math 217 not the engineering version 214) it is extremely difficult but really pushes you to think about the problems and their application and is very collaborative. I had Scott Schneider as my professor and he was the best. 

Calc 3 was just interesting in the problems we solved and how rewarding it feels if you actually get something right. 

All in all if you choose to take the classes here, go to office hours! I cannot stress office hours enough, the homework is so much easier if you go as they can walk through problems with you and give you many hints. I went at least once a week for all those classes.

15293,"I'm taking EECS 203 (Discrete) right now, I took Math 214 (Applied Linear Algebra) last semester, and I took Calc 3/Diff Eq at a community college in high school.

My experience:

Math 214:

\- Not well taught (largely due to my prof being 75 years old and well-passed his teaching prime, I've heard better things about other profs)

\- Not well organized but not terribly difficult

\- Interesting projects where we got to apply linear algebra concepts to our interests (most of the course were CS/Data Science/other engineers)

\- The nice thing about Michigan is that is there are (at least) 5 different linear algebra courses you can take, some of which are more proof-based/theoretical and others more applied (similar to AP/CC courses).

\- Other courses (namely math 217 which is the proof-based lin alg class) are known for being on the more difficult side but very valuable if you plan on taking any other math courses

EECS 203:

\- While EECS 203 is notoriously pretty difficult, I've found that the instruction is top notch. I've been to/watched lectures with all three current profs and they all seem very knowledgable and willing to help.

\- The class size is on the larger end (over 500 students pretty sure) and all sections are taught by one team (as opposed to other courses where each prof does it differently). This structure makes it much easier to answers to questions, find course info, etc.

\- Overall I'd say 203 is a great course (though difficult) and there's not really a reason to not take it at Michigan. As others mentioned, I'd be surprised if you can find a CC that has a discrete math course, let alone one that would be accepted for credit by Michigan.

Calc 3/Diff Eq:

My roommate was in Calc 3 last semester and is in diff eq this semester so I've seen a lot of what the courses are like at Michigan. The biggest difference I've seen content-wise is just a bit more depth of concepts/extra complexity on homework problems. Also similar issues to what I mentioned about 214 (mediocre instruction and lack of organization).

&#x200B;

Overall, I would say that you absolutely do not need to rush into taking Calc 3/Lin alg/Discrete before coming to Michigan and that taking them here will not be the worst thing ever (though a lot of people might make them out to be the worst classes ever). These courses are going to be some of the most challenging courses you take, regardless of where you take them. The biggest difference is that you might get better instruction/course organization at a CC, but you'll definitely learn more at Michigan.

The last thing I'd say is that being able to take Calc 3/Diff Eq in high school was probably the single most valuable thing I did in HS simply because the courses allowed to me get an idea of what college courses are like and how to teach myself content (which you'll have to do at any college and basically any course). Your first college-level math class is going to be a struggle simply as a result of the workload and difference in instruction compared to HS.

Calc and Lin Alg you can take at cc or something if you want. Sure. I‚Äôd recommend probably taking like calc 3 and 4 over the summer at cc or something, but taking Rob 101 or Math 214 for Lin Alg should be fine.

CHEM 262 (calc 3, linear algebra, and dif eq for physical sciences) in FA22 was the first class that made me tear up. I am not sure about calc 3 and lin algebra as individual classes though. 

For context, I had a pretty strong background in math from high school (math team captain, 5 in AP calc, dubbed the ‚Äúmath wiz‚Äù), but it didn‚Äôt stop me from doing a 180 and disliking math here. My only advice for freshman is to not take math here.

There are several different linear algebra classes to take depending on your major or specialty, some of which are much harder than others. I'd recommend just taking whatever your advisor recommends.
